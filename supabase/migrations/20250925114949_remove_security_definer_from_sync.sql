-- Update comment to reflect the change
comment on function sync_events(jsonb) is 'Syncs events for multiple streams. Input: {"stream_id": {"last_synced_ids": {"device_id": next_needed_index}}}. Returns events with within_device_events_index >= provided value for requested devices, and ALL events for devices not specified but present in the stream. Runs with invoker permissions for better security.';

-- The get_clock function doesn't use security definer, so no changes needed there
-- It's already properly secured with RLS since it only reads data
