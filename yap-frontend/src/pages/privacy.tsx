              Yap.Town is a language-learning app built and operated by André
              Popovitch. The short version: we collect what's needed to teach
              you a language and sync your progress between devices, we don't
              sell your data, we don't run ads, and there are no advertising or
              analytics trackers on the site.

            What we collect

            <p>
              <span className="text-foreground">Account.</span> Your email
              address and password (stored hashed by our auth provider). If
              you add a passkey, our auth provider stores its public key; we
              never receive the private key or your biometric data. You can
              optionally add a display name and bio, which are visible to
              other users.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="text-foreground">Learning activity.</span> The
              words you add, your reviews and ratings, streaks, XP, and course
              selection. This is the heart of the app: it's stored on our
              servers so your progress syncs between devices, and a copy lives
              on your device so yap works offline.

            <p>
              <span className="text-foreground">Practice audio and answers.</span>{" "}
              When you use pronunciation practice, your microphone recording is
              sent to our server and to AI providers to generate feedback. When
              you type answers to challenges, the answer is sent to AI
              providers for grading. The iOS app also saves unfinished typed
              answers, tapped-word hints, and grading results locally on your
              device so you can resume an interrupted review. That pending
              review is cleared when you continue. These are processed to give you feedback,
              not to build a profile of you. Audio we generate for sentences is
              kept in a shared cache on Cloudflare so it doesn't have to be
              generated again for the next learner; those clips are keyed by
              the sentence text alone and contain nothing about you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="text-foreground">Exported Anki decks.</span>{" "}
              When you download an Anki deck, we record that the deck was made,
              the options you chose, and your account if you were signed in.
              Audio in the deck streams from us, and each time a card makes us
              generate a clip that wasn't already cached we log which sentence
              it was and when, tied to that deck. We use this to keep the cost
              of generating audio in check and to switch off a deck that is
              being shared in ways it shouldn't be.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="text-foreground">Technical.</span> We use Sentry
              for error and performance monitoring on the site and in the iOS app
              so we can fix crashes. Error
              reports can include your IP address and device information, and a
              sample of website sessions is recorded as a session replay (a
              reconstruction of what the app showed and where you clicked) to
              help us debug. The iOS app does not record session replays.
