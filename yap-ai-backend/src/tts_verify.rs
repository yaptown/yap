//! An ASR gate for synthesized speech.
//!
//! `audio_codec::audio_defect` catches audio that is broken as a *signal* —
//! silent, undecodable, truncated. It cannot catch audio that is a perfectly
//! healthy recording of the wrong words, because it never sees the text. That
//! gap is not theoretical: Gemini reproducibly read the French sentence
//! "Les Baxter ici ?" as "Laisse Baxter ici" — swapping an article for a verb
//! and inverting the meaning — and sailed through every existing check, since
//! `audio_defect` returns early for any clip at or over a second.
//!
//! So we transcribe what the provider actually produced and compare it to what
//! we asked for, using `whisper-large-v3-turbo` — hosted by both Cloudflare
//! Workers AI (~$0.0005/audio-minute, so a two-second clip costs about 1.7e-5
//! dollars) and Groq (~$0.04/audio-hour, the same order of magnitude). The two
//! hosts race and the first transcript wins: same model, so the transcripts
//! agree, but measured on the same clip Cloudflare took 0.8–4.3s per call
//! while Groq took 0.3–0.9s. Racing rather than preferring Groq means a Groq
//! outage costs nothing — the race degrades to exactly the old behaviour.
//!
//! Three design points worth keeping:
//!
//! 1. **Compare with punctuation stripped.** Whisper's punctuation is its own
//!    invention — across our fixtures it variously dropped a period, added a
//!    question mark, and added a comma, all on correct audio. Comparing raw
//!    strings would reject good clips constantly.
//! 2. **Condition on proper nouns, never on the full text.** Whisper's
//!    `initial_prompt` supplies vocabulary without dictating the transcript,
//!    so a name like "Baxter" stops reading as a mispronunciation while a
//!    genuinely wrong article still comes back wrong. Its sibling parameter
//!    `prefix` would be actively harmful — it forces the output to *start*
//!    with the text you give it, which would paper over precisely the
//!    sentence-initial error that motivated this module.
//! 3. **Fail open.** A verifier that is down, rate-limited, or unconfigured
//!    must never cost a learner their audio. Every uncertain path returns
//!    "no defect".
