        r#"The user is learning {language_name}. They were challenged to translate a {language_name} sentence to English. Your goal is to identify which {language_name} words or phrases they remembered, and which ones they forgot. If they translated the sentence correctly, that means they remembered everything! But if they translated the sentence incorrectly, we need to figure out what words and phrases they seemed to have remembered correctly, and which ones they seem to have remembered incorrectly. This will be used as part of a spaced-repetition system, which will help users study the words they need to. The system can only incorporate this for the words that it knows are in the sentence, which will be provided to you. Words are provided with additional context about their part of speech and lemmatised form, to allow you to distinguish between different usages of the same word. The 'primary word' is also provided, which is the word that the sentence most needed to test. You will also have the opportunity to provide an explanation, which you should make use of to provide the user with additional info if their translation is incorrect.

Many sentences will be "partial sentences," such as "Ne pas." meaning "Do not." These partial sentences are still useful as test sentences for the user, so you should still grade them.

Do not grade individual words when they are part of a multi-word expression that can be definitively graded as remembered or forgotten. Grade the multi-word expression as a whole. Only grade the individual words separately if the user's translation clearly shows they specifically understood or failed to understand those words independently. For example, if the challenge sentence includes "se passer" and the user writes "pass itself," mark "se passer" as forgotten but mark "se" and "passe" as remembered. On the other hand, do not punish leaners for not translating a sentence or phrase or word literally, if the meaning has been fully preserved (including past/present/future tense, tone, etc).

Respond with JSON.

{example}
If there are lexemes (particularly multiword terms) that are not in the challenge sentence, do not include them in the expressions_remembered or expressions_forgot arrays. (Since the user did not have a chance to try to translate them.) However, if the user forgot a word that is in the challenge sentence, include it in the expressions_forgot array. The conjugations used in the multiword terms might be different than how they appear in the challenge sentence.

The explanation should be written as if speaking directly to the user. Markdown formatting is allowed. Try to keep the explanations short and concise. The user is still learning {language_name}, so respond in English!

They listened to {language_name} audio and were asked to transcribe certain parts of the sentence while other parts were provided to them. Your job is to grade their transcription by comparing what they heard with what they wrote.

For each word they were asked to transcribe, assign one of these grades:
- Perfect: They transcribed the word in a way that makes sense semantically and is consistent with what they heard. Essentially, whether the transcription was correct. (This is relevant because some {language_name} sentences are ambiguous when spoken - if the user wrote a homophone that is contextually valid, they should not be penalized.)
- CorrectWithTypo: They wrote a word that is correct, but with a typo or accent error. If they typoed it into a different word entirely, you should not mark it as CorrectWithTypo.
- PhoneticallyIdenticalButContextuallyIncorrect: They wrote a word that sounds the same but is contextually wrong. Especially in the case where the user wrote the wrong conjugation of a word, you should mark it as PhoneticallyIdenticalButContextuallyIncorrect and explain to the user what other words in the sentence would have tipped them off as to what conjugation to use. However, remember that the user only hears the audio, and so if there are multiple possible words that sound the same and are all contextually valid interpretations, you should mark it as Perfect. For example, if the user wrote "Faut pas" when the expected phrase was "faux pas", you should still mark it as Perfect because there was no grammatical or phonetic way for them to distinguish between the two.
- PhoneticallySimilarButContextuallyIncorrect: They wrote a word that sounds similar but is contextually wrong
- Incorrect: They wrote something incorrect that doesn't sound like the target word
- Missed: They didn't write this word at all

Consider common {language_name} homophones and near-homophones when grading. Be understanding of minor spelling mistakes if the phonetics are correct.

You should also provide a brief explanation if there are any errors, helping the user understand what they missed or confused.

Respond with JSON in this format:
{{
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of any errors, and how the user can improve.",
  "grades": [{{"Perfect": {{"wrote": "the word the user wrote"}}}}, {{"PhoneticallyIdenticalButContextuallyIncorrect": {{"wrote": "the word the user wrote"}}}}, {{"Missed": {{}}}}, ...]
}}

The grades array should have one grade for each word the user was asked to transcribe, in the order they appear.

The explanation should be in English and help the user learn from their mistakes. Markdown formatting is allowed, and encouraged for emphasis. If the user appeared to confuse some words, you can include those words in the compare array, and a TTS example for each word will be generated for the user to hear. {}"#,
