/// - **One attempt with the requested provider first.** Nearly every request

/// - **Then every provider at once, not one after another.** A clip that
///   failed the transcript check has already told us this provider is getting
///   the words wrong; asking the alternatives in sequence just stacks their
///   latencies. Racing them turns three round-trips into one.
/// - **First clip to pass wins.** Not "best" — there's no meaningful ranking
///   among clips that all say the right words, and waiting for a preferred
///   one would give back the latency we just bought. The trade is that the
///   voice on a rescued sentence isn't deterministic across runs.
/// - **Fifteen seconds after the first audible clip, stop waiting.** Some
///   sentences can never pass — "la mer" transcribes as "la mère" on
///   perfectly correct audio — and before this bound they burned every arm's
///   full budget on every fetch. The grace is deliberately generous: an arm
///   that is going to pass does so within one synth-and-verify cycle, a few
///   seconds, so fifteen keeps essentially every genuine rescue and a wrong
///   clip is only ever returned when the alternatives had ample time to beat
///   it and couldn't. It starts at the first *audible* clip rather than the
///   request, because until something is worth returning there is nothing to
///   trade latency against.
///
/// The audio returned may not come from the requested provider. That's
/// intended: the client treats `provider` as a preference rather than a

/// Two voices per language, because Chirp3-HD mishandles `<break>` — and it

///
/// ```text
/// <break time="100ms"/><say-as interpret-as="characters">e</say-as>
/// <break time="100ms"/>comme dans<break time="200ms"/>je
/// ```
///
/// Chirp3-HD reads that back as "comme dans", losing both the letter being
/// taught and the example word. Measured on the "e" card (transcribed with
/// the same Whisper model the ASR gate uses):
///
/// | payload                     | Chirp3-HD     | Neural2            |
/// |-----------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
/// | breaks + say-as (we ship)   | "comme dans"  | "euh comme dans J" |
/// | breaks only                 | "comme dans"  | "euh comme dans J" |
/// | say-as only, no breaks      | "e comme dans jeu" | "e comme dans J" |
/// | say-as, digraph "ch"        | "CH comme dans chat" | "CH comme dans chat" |
///
/// So `<say-as>` is *fine* on Chirp3-HD; `<break>` is the whole problem. This
/// is worth stating precisely because the obvious fix — drop the breaks, keep
/// the better voice — doesn't work either, for two reasons:
///
/// 1. Google's documented alternative, `[pause]` tags in the `markup` input
///    field, fails identically: `e [pause short] comme dans [pause] je` comes
///    back as "comme dans jeu", letter gone. Chirp3-HD has no working way to
///    put a pause before a short token.
/// 2. Chirp3-HD is generative, and on fragments this short it embellishes.
///    Asked for "e comme dans je" with no pauses at all it produced "c'est
///    comme dans le jeu" and "e comme dans je t'aide" — inventing words we
///    never sent. Neural2 and Wavenet returned the exact text every time.
///
/// For a card whose entire job is to demonstrate one letter, saying precisely
/// the requested words beats naturalness. That's the real axis here, and it's
/// why the split isn't just "older tier for SSML": Chirp3-HD stays the better
/// choice on the plain-text paths (grams, dictionary, sentence fallback).
///
/// # How this regressed without us touching it
///
/// The card shipped working in March 2026 and broke months later with no
/// change on our side. Google's release notes date the cause to 2025-10-17:
/// "Chirp 3 HD now supports speech synthesis using SSML input. Supported SSML
/// tags are: `<phoneme>`, `<p>`, `<s>`, `<sub>`, and `<say-as>`." No
/// `<break>` — so our breaks were silently *ignored*, the rest was read
/// correctly, and the card sounded right. Google later added `<break>` to the
/// supported list (it's on the Chirp3-HD docs page now, with no release-note
/// entry), and the implementation ate the adjacent text. Support for the tag
/// turned out to be worse than not having it.
///
/// Nothing downstream catches this: the audio is a healthy recording so
/// `audio_defect` passes it, and the ASR gate skips SSML because a transcript
/// can't resemble markup. It has to be caught here, at the point where a

        r#"{PERSONALITY}The user is learning {target_language_name} through transcription exercises. They listened to {target_language_name} audio and were asked to transcribe certain parts of the sentence while other parts were provided to them. Your job is to grade their transcription by comparing what they heard with what they wrote.

For each word they were asked to transcribe, assign one of these grades:
- Perfect: They transcribed the word in a way that makes sense semantically and is consistent with what they heard. Essentially, whether the transcription was correct. (This is relevant because some {target_language_name} sentences are ambiguous when spoken - if the user wrote a homophone that is contextually valid, they should not be penalized.)
- CorrectWithTypo: They wrote a word that is correct, but with a typo or accent error. If they typoed it into a different word entirely, you should not mark it as CorrectWithTypo.
- PhoneticallyIdenticalButContextuallyIncorrect: They wrote a word that sounds the same but is contextually wrong. Especially in the case where the user wrote the wrong conjugation of a word, you should mark it as PhoneticallyIdenticalButContextuallyIncorrect and explain to the user what other words in the sentence would have tipped them off as to what conjugation to use. However, remember that the user only hears the audio, and so if there are multiple possible words that sound the same and are all contextually valid interpretations, you should mark it as Perfect. For example, if the user wrote "Faut pas" when the expected phrase was "faux pas", you should still mark it as Perfect because there was no grammatical or phonetic way for them to distinguish between the two.
- PhoneticallySimilarButContextuallyIncorrect: They wrote a word that sounds similar but is contextually wrong
- Incorrect: They wrote something incorrect that doesn't sound like the target word
- Missed: They didn't write this word at all

Consider common {target_language_name} homophones and near-homophones when grading. Be understanding of minor spelling mistakes if the phonetics are correct.

The sentence the user heard and the text they wrote may each be followed by an IPA pronunciation line. Use the IPA to judge whether a mistake is phonetically identical, merely similar, or neither. The IPA is generated by espeak and may be incorrect — especially the IPA of what the user wrote, if their submission contains typos. Either IPA line may be absent.

{language_specific_phonetic_note}You should always provide encouragement highlighting what the user did right and acknowledging their progress. If there are any errors, also provide a brief explanation focusing on where they made mistakes and how they can improve.

Respond with JSON in this format:
{{
  "encouragement": "Always provide this: warm, encouraging message highlighting what the user got right and their progress.",
  "explanation": "Only if there are errors: brief explanation of where they made mistakes and how they can improve.",
  "grades": [{{"grade": "Perfect", "wrote": "the word the user wrote"}}, {{"grade": "PhoneticallyIdenticalButContextuallyIncorrect", "wrote": "the word the user wrote"}}, {{"grade": "Missed", "wrote": null}}, ...]
}}

The grades array should have one grade for each word the user was asked to transcribe, in the order they appear. Set `wrote` to the word the user wrote for that position, or null for Missed.

The encouragement should always be provided, be in {native_language_name}, be a short positive message (1-2 sentences), and focus on what they got right. The explanation should only be provided if there are errors, be in {native_language_name}, focus on their mistakes and how to improve, and help the user learn from their errors. Markdown formatting is allowed, and encouraged for emphasis (just no bullet points or numbered lists). If the user appeared to confuse some words, you can include those words in the compare array, and a TTS example for each word will be generated for the user to hear. {}

The explanation should avoid generic advice like "try to listen more carefully" — the goal is to only write information helpful for the user to understand their mistakes. When a user confuses or misses a word, it is often helpful to break the word down into its component parts (morphemes, compound elements, prefix/suffix structure) so the user can see how simpler pieces they may already know combine into the target word. For example, if the target word was "malheureusement", you might point out that it builds from "mal" (bad) + "heur" (luck) + "euse" (french builds adverbs from the feminine adjective) + "ment" (adverb suffix). This is about practical decomposition — showing recognizable building blocks — not historical etymology. Only do this when the decomposition actually clarifies something (why the word sounds the way it does, why it's spelled that way, how to remember it). If the word is monomorphemic or the breakdown wouldn't help, skip it.

When you mention a {target_language_name} word or phrase inside the encouragement or explanation, wrap it in a <word>...</word> tag (e.g. <word>word</word>). This lets the UI style and pronounce it correctly. Do not wrap {native_language_name} text.

P.S. Don't bother giving the user IPA-style phonetic transcriptions as they may not understand them. But you can still try to explain the phonetic differences in terms that the user might understand.

The input may include a Context block naming the film the sentence comes from and the dialogue lines around it. Use it only to judge which homophones and conjugations are contextually valid — never grade the context lines themselves."#,
