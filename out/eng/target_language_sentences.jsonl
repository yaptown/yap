"There's nothing we can do about it."
"No, we can't."
"Maybe, maybe not."
"Maybe that's it."
"Yes, you could say that."
"Maybe it's him."

"What is your real name?"
"You may be right."
"He may be right."
"She may be right."

"What if it was?"
"It wasn't."
"What if it is?"
"It has always been the case."
"Because it is."
"Maybe it is."
"Maybe I should go."
"There is no question of that."
"That is not the question."
"That's a very good question."
"It wasn't a question."
"This is not a question."
"You are part of the family."
"He is part of the family."

"I see it in your eyes."
"It's a figure of speech."
"That's what I'm talking about."
"I have to find him."
"Do you want a hand?"
"Do you want a helping hand?"
"Thanks for the help."
"No, it's the first time."
"We must be able to do something."
"She's just a child."
"It just came to me."
"I didn't ask him."
"I didn't ask you anything."
"I asked him to come."
"It took you a long time."
"Is it because of me?"
"It's because of you."
"It's for a good cause."
"I think he's gone."
"This is very good news."
"Give me a hand."
"What does it give?"
"You are far from home."
"He's a good person."
"You are a good person."
"He was a good person."
"I need to talk to someone."
"I am a good person."
"It's the end of the world."
"It's your turn."
"What did he want?"
"What did she want?"
"That's what he wanted."
"We got what we wanted."
"Can I ask you something?"
"I have to ask you something."
"I wanted to ask you something."
"I want to ask you something."
"I have to ask you to leave."
"No, it's not going well at all."
"I know what you did."
"Do you know what you did?"
"That's all I know."
"It's as good as done."
"That's all I want."
"If that's what you want."
"Is that all you have?"
"It's up to me to do it."
"Did I do this?"
"That's what you want, right?"
"Isn't that what you want?"
"That's what I want to do."
"That's just how it is."
"Is that what you want to do?"
"That's all it is."
"Yes, that's what I want."
"That's what you did."
"Did you do this?"
"It's up to you to do it."
"That's what you said."
"Who told you to do this?"
"He's the one who did that."
"You can do whatever you want."
"I can do whatever I want."
"No, I can't do that."
"I know you can do it."
"No, you can't do that."
"I know I can do it."
"You know what I mean."
"That's what I mean."
"I know what you mean."
"Is that what you mean?"
"You can say whatever you want."
"You don't want to tell me?"
"That's what I'm going to do."
"You know what I'm going to do?"
"I know what I'm going to do."
"I will do what I can."
"Is it yes or is it no?"
"Is it a yes or a no?"
"But I'll tell you one thing."
"Okay, I'm leaving."
"You know that, don't you?"
"There's more to it than that."
"You don't have to do it."
"No, I didn't say that."
"No, there isn't."
"That's good, isn't it?"
"It was you, wasn't it?"
"I don't have to do it."
"She has no business being here."
"There's only us left."
"It's not just him."
"I didn't say anything at all."
"No, that's not why."
"Thank you for what you have done."
"What do you mean?"
"What did he say?"
"What are we going to do?"
"What did you do?"
"What did you say?"
"What am I going to do?"
"What did he do?"
"What can I do?"
"What did she say?"
"That's what he said."
"What do you want to do?"
"What is he doing here?"
"What are we doing here?"
"What do you know about it?"
"That's all we have."
"What can I say?"
"What do we have here?"
"That's what she said."
"But what is it?"
"What do you have there?"
"What is she doing here?"
"What did she do?"
"What did they say?"
"So what do we do?"
"And what is it?"
"What did we do?"
"What is he going to do?"
"So what is it?"
"That's what they said."
"That's what we're going to do."
"That's how we do it."
"What's it doing there?"
"What do we do with it?"
"Do you know what we're going to do?"
"But what is he doing?"
"What did they do?"
"What do you want from him?"
"But what do you have?"
"That's what he did."
"So what do we have?"
"That's what we did."
"How does that make you feel?"
"Do you know what he did?"
"Yes, what is it?"
"Do you know what he said?"
"I know what we're going to do."
"What can you do?"
"That's what I'm told."
"But what do you want?"
"What is it, then?"
"So what do you want?"
"What am I going to say?"
"What is she going to do?"
"But what was it?"
"What did that do?"
"But what is she doing?"
"What's it doing here?"
"And what does he do?"
"Do you know what she said?"
"We make do with what we have."
"What was that?"
"You never told me that."
"No, I never said that."
"Is this really what you want?"
"You know that as well as I do."
"I've never felt better."
"That's what we'll see."
"It's so good to see you."
"No, it has nothing to do with it."
"I never want to see you again."
"It's good to see you too."
"Oh, what is it?"
"What do we do now?"
"I can't do this now."
"What do they all have?"
"What does it matter?"
"What can we do?"
"What could it be?"
"We do everything we can."
"What can we do about it?"
"What are you going to do?"
"I know what you're going to say."
"You're not there at all."
"Is there anything else I can do for you?"
"And I'll tell you something else."
"But what are you doing?"
"What am I doing here?"
"What are you doing to me?"
"What do I do now?"
"What if I don't?"
"I do everything I can."
"I do what I'm told."
"But what am I doing?"
"Act like nothing happened."
"What are you doing now?"
"And what are you doing?"
"So what do I do?"
"And what do I do?"
"That's all I do."
"What are you doing to him?"
"And that's what I do."
"But that's what I do."
"So what are you doing?"
"Do you have something to tell me?"
"Can I do something for you?"
"No, we don't have time."
"No, I don't have time."
"There is a time for everything."
"I get told that all the time."
"You have always been there for me."
"I'm not there yet."
"What is it again?"
"What else do you want?"
"You don't need this."
"You don't need him."
"You need it more than I do."
"You don't need me anymore."
"I don't need him."
"No, I don't need it."
"This is what must be done."
"This is what we need."
"Do you know what you need?"
"What should be done?"
"I know what to do."
"I know what I have to do."
"I know what you need."
"We have everything we need."
"This is what I need."
"I need a little time."
"That's all it takes."
"This is what you need."
"Do you have everything you need?"
"You know what to do."
"You know what you have to do."
"What should I do?"
"What should I say?"
"This is what I have to do."
"This is what you have to do."
"When you have to go, you have to go."
"What did you see?"
"What did he see?"
"I've never seen this before."
"Are you sure this is it?"
"I'm not sure yet."
"Are you sure it's him?"
"Are you sure everything is okay?"
"How can you be so sure?"
"I need to talk to you about something."
"I want to talk to you about something."
"You didn't have to do it."
"I think I'll go."
"What do you think you're doing?"
"You think I don't know?"
"I think it's yours."
"Is that what I think?"
"I think it's over there."
"I think we have something."
"I think about you all the time."
"That's what I think too."
"Yes, that's what I think."
"I think she likes me."
"What did you get?"
"What did he get?"
"That's where I'm from."
"Is what they say true?"
"That was two years ago."
"Do you know what that means?"
"I know what that means."
"What does he mean?"
"What does he want from me?"
"We can do whatever we want."
"What does she mean?"
"What does he want from you?"
"He can do whatever he wants."
"What should we do?"
"This is what we have to do."
"Maybe that's a good thing."
"It was the right thing to do."
"Maybe it's better this way."
"I'm doing the best I can."
"Do you know what you're going to do?"
"What are you going to say?"
"I know what you're going to do."
"Where are my wife and daughter?"
"That's all I'm saying."
"Tell me what I should do."
"What do I tell him?"
"Say what you have to say."
"That's what I'm telling you."
"That's what I tell myself."
"That's what I always say."
"Tell me what you saw."
"What do I tell them?"
"Tell me what you did."
"You do what I tell you."
"Yes, that's what I'm saying."
"Tell me what I can do."
"I know what you're thinking."
"That's what you always say."
"You see what I mean?"
"I see what you mean."
"Do you see what you did?"
"What do I see here?"
"What does this mean?"
"Where did he go?"
"It's going to take a little time."
"What do you want to know?"
"Do you want to know what I think?"
"You want to know what I think?"
"That's what I want to know."
"I want to know what it is."
"We have things to say to each other."
"What if I can't do it?"
"Mom, what are you doing?"
"That's all I have left."
"That's all we have left."
"What do I have left?"
"That's what I meant."
"That's what you wanted, right?"
"That's all I wanted."
"Isn't that what you wanted?"
"That's what I wanted to know."
"What did you mean?"
"I wanted to talk to you about something."
"I know what you meant."
"This is really not the time."
"Do you think this is the time?"
"Dad, what are you doing?"
"What's going on again?"
"What's going on here?"
"But what's going on?"
"I'll see what happens."
"So what's going on?"
"Mom, what's going on?"
"Dad, what's going on?"
"What's happening now?"
"I know what's going on here."
"Can I know what's going on?"
"What's going on, Dad?"
"That's what scares me."
"Who are you and what do you want?"
"What did you find?"
"Wait, what are you doing?"
"You don't know who I am?"
"That was three years ago."
"Do you know where I can find it?"
"What got into me?"
"What did you take?"
"What did he take?"
"How could you do this to me?"
"What does he know about it?"
"That's all we know."
"What does she know about it?"
"Nobody knows I'm here."
"I'm going as fast as I can."
"I'm doing it as fast as I can."
"It's time for you to go."
"So what do you do?"
"It was the only thing to do."
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Hey, what's going on?"
"Hey, what is it?"
"This is the chance of a lifetime."
"I'm talking to you."
"I really need to talk to you."
"What is he talking about?"
"This is the one I'm talking to."
"Maybe that's a good idea."
"Any idea what this is?"
"Who is this from?"
"It was two days ago."
"Tonight is the big night."
"I am a friend of the family."
"He is a friend of the family."
"I see where you're going with this."
"Do you see where I'm going with this?"
"I know where you're going with this."
"It's a little late for that."
"What are you doing, man?"
"What's going on, man?"
"Dude, what are you doing?"
"What's going to happen?"
"Something must have happened."
"I know what's going to happen."
"I want to spend my life with you."
"How many times do I have to say it?"
"Okay, you can go."
"Can I do anything for you?"
"So what can I do for you?"
"I've never heard of it."
"What did you hear?"
"Do you understand what I mean?"
"Do you understand what I'm telling you?"
"Do you understand what that means?"
"I understand what you mean."
"How long have you been together?"
"That's all I care about."
"No, it is not."
"What if it isn't?"
"That's the way to say it."
"It never was."
"It didn't."
"Do you know what you should do?"
"I think I should go."
"Yes, that's what I thought."
"Yeah, that's what I thought."
"That's what I thought too."
"That's what I was thinking."
"That's all I ask."
"I wonder what it is."
"That's what I wonder."
"That's what I'm asking you."
"I ask you one last time."
"Take it or leave it."
"I've heard a lot about you."
"You never told me about it."
"You were the one who brought it up."
"What happened to him?"
"What happened to you?"
"What happened to me?"
"What happened to us?"
"When did this happen?"
"What happened to them?"
"But that day never came."
"Do you know what happened to him?"
"You know what we should do?"
"I think we should go."
"But that was a long time ago."
"It was so long ago."
"What are they going to do?"
"It's so good to see you again."
"I'm doing it."
"What did you do with his body?"
"I can see it in your eyes."
"That's one way of putting it."
"I'll see what I find."
"What happened to your hand?"
"It's just like old times."
"It will be like the good old days."
"It's good that you're here."
"I came to say goodbye to you."
"You have your whole life ahead of you."
"She is not in her room."
"She's beautiful, isn't she?"
"People have the right to know."
"And that's all that matters."
"That's the only thing that matters."
"I'll give you a hand."
"Have you told anyone about this?"
"Is there anyone with you?"
"You have to see it to believe it."
"It feels like yesterday."
"He got what he wanted."
"What did that mean?"
"I could ask you the same thing."
"I came as quickly as possible."
"What are you doing outside?"
"What's going on outside?"
"The best day of my life."
"He's handsome, isn't he?"
"That was years ago."
"I believe he is telling the truth."
"What's mine is mine."
"Is that all you know how to do?"
"Is that all you can do?"
"That's all I know how to do."
"That's all I can do."
"Is that all you care about?"
"That's why I'm here."
"What's mine is yours."
"Is that what I am to you?"
"That's what I told myself."
"That's what I told him."
"Is that what you told him?"
"That's why you're here."
"You know I can't."
"That's all I can say."
"It's up to you to tell me."
"Is that all you can say?"
"You know you can tell me anything."
"That's all I want to say."
"And that's what I'm going to do."
"I'll tell you what I know."
"Yes, that's what I'm going to do."
"I'll tell you what it is."
"So, is it yes or no?"
"That's what you told me."
"He's the one who did this to me."
"I've heard good things about you."
"No, that's not it at all."
"But there's more to it than that."
"No, you don't have to do that."
"Thank you for everything you have done."
"That's what I was told."
"What makes you say that?"
"That's why we're here."
"That's what he told me."
"What did you do to me?"
"That's all there is to it."
"What can I do about it?"
"What did I do to you?"
"Do you know what he told me?"
"What do you have for me?"
"What, what's up?"
"That's what they told me."
"What am I going to tell him?"
"So what's up?"
"That's what she told me."
"What did I tell you?"
"Is that what he told you?"
"What did he tell you?"
"What do we do with him?"
"And what did he say?"
"What do you want to tell me?"
"What did they do to him?"
"So what are we going to do?"
"What did I do to him?"
"What did he do to you?"
"What did you tell me?"
"What am I going to do with it?"
"Is that all he said?"
"What did he do to her?"
"But what did you do?"
"And that's what we're going to do."
"What are we going to do with it?"
"What are we going to tell him?"
"What's here?"
"What do you want to do with it?"
"What does that make me?"
"And what did he do?"
"And what did you say?"
"Do you know what she told me?"
"Is that what she told you?"
"So what did he say?"
"So what do you want to do?"
"That's what we were told."
"And what did you do?"
"What do you know about me?"
"And that's what he did."
"What did they do to you?"
"That's why he's here."
"And what are we going to do?"
"What can you do about it?"
"What don't I know?"
"But what are we going to do?"
"What did she tell you?"
"Well, what's up?"
"Yes, that's what he said."
"What's there?"
"And you, what do you want?"
"What did he do with it?"
"What do you want to do there?"
"But what can I do?"
"What can I tell you?"
"I only have one thing to say."
"What don't you know?"
"We do what we have to do."
"Is that all she said?"
"Is that what he said?"
"What does that make you?"
"And what did she say?"
"Yes, that's what she said."
"I'll see what I can do."
"She has nothing to do with it."
"What does that have to do with it?"
"We'll see what we'll see."
"What are we going to do now?"
"What am I going to do now?"
"And now what do we do?"
"What's next?"
"So what do we do now?"
"What does it matter to you?"
"Maybe yes, maybe no."
"That's all we can do."
"We'll see what we can do."
"What does it matter to me?"
"There can only be one."
"I'll see what we can do."
"There are only the two of us left."
"What are you going to do to him?"
"I'll tell him you're here."
"What do you do with that?"
"But what are you doing here?"
"And you, what are you doing?"
"So what are you doing here?"
"What are you doing around here?"
"I know exactly what I'm doing."
"What do I do with this?"
"You do what you have to do."
"What am I doing with you?"
"And what are you doing here?"
"Is there anything I can do?"
"I know there is something."
"Do you have anything to do with this?"
"Did he say anything?"
"There is always something to do."
"What are you still doing here?"
"What did he do now?"
"What have you done now?"
"That's all I need."
"That's how it's done."
"There is everything you need."
"That's all we need."
"What should I do now?"
"It's something I have to do."
"I want to do something with my life."
"Did you see what you did?"
"I was told you were here."
"That's what everyone says."
"There is something for everyone."
"I'll tell everyone."
"It takes all sorts to make a world."
"Are you sure about what you're doing?"
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"It's good because it's you."
"Because there aren't any."
"That's what I want to talk about."
"I never told anyone that."
"I'll tell you what I believe."
"My God, what is this?"
"I'll tell you what I think."
"That's what everyone thinks."
"That's how I like them."
"What did you just say?"
"What did I just say?"
"That's what I just said."
"What did you just do?"
"Do you know what you just did?"
"That's what I told them."
"What am I going to tell them?"
"What are we going to tell them?"
"What did you do to them?"
"But what does that mean?"
"What does all this mean?"
"It means what it means."
"You know what that means, right?"
"And you know what that means?"
"This is how it should be."
"Who said this was your place?"
"I think that's a good thing."
"It's what you do best."
"Don't you have anything better to do?"
"It's what I do best."
"She's your mother, isn't she?"
"So what are you going to do?"
"And what are you going to do?"
"You'll see what you'll see."
"I know what you're going to tell me."
"What are you going to do there?"
"What are you going to tell them?"
"Tell him what you told me."
"I say it because it's true."
"Tell them what you told me."
"You will do what I tell you."
"Are you telling me now?"
"Is that how you see me?"
"That's how I see it."
"I only believe what I see."
"I don't think that's it."
"What are your plans for tonight?"
"That's all I want to know."
"That's all you need to know."
"We have a lot to say to each other."
"Mom, what are you doing here?"
"You're all I have left."
"That's all I wanted to know."
"That's what I wanted to tell you."
"That's all I wanted to say."
"Yes, that's what I meant."
"There is only one God."
"Dad, what are you doing here?"
"You would have done the same for me."
"That's how it goes."
"But what's going on here?"
"What's going on with you?"
"Do you want to tell me what's going on?"
"Don't you see what's going on?"
"Can you tell me what's going on?"
"I'll tell you what's going on."
"What's going on with him?"
"I know something is going on."
"Look what you made me do."
"What's going on, guys?"
"But what do you want from me?"
"Is that all you found?"
"I'll see what I can find."
"I don't know, but I'll find out."
"He only does what he wants."
"We did what we could."
"You did what you could."
"How could I not see it?"
"Call me if you need me."
"But does your mom know where you are?"
"Who are you and what are you doing here?"
"What are you guys doing?"
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
"I'm the lucky one."
"You know exactly what I'm talking about."
"I think we need to talk."
"You know very well what I'm talking about."
"Do you think this is a good idea?"
"I think it's a good idea."
"I think that's a good idea."
"No, that's not a good idea."
"What's tomorrow?"
"You can come with me if you want."
"What are you going to do, huh?"
"What will happen now?"
"It's time to move on."
"What could have happened?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"How long ago was that?"
"I think this is a great idea."
"I've never heard of him."
"Did you hear what he said?"
"You heard what he said."
"I've never heard of that."
"You heard what she said."
"What did he just say?"
"What don't you understand?"
"What don't I understand?"
"You know what I don't understand?"
"That's what I don't understand."
"Take all the time you need."
"What if it doesn't?"
"But what if it isn't?"
"I told him it was over."
"She left an hour ago."
"That's all I ask of you."
"I ask you this for the last time."
"I don't do that kind of thing."
"Let me see what I can do."
"I never told anyone about it."
"I don't know what happened."
"I wonder what happened to him."
"You can stay as long as you want."
"What are they going to do to him?"
"You don't belong here."
"There is room for two."
"I knew there was something."
"I could say the same thing about you."
"What did you give him?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Who am I talking to?"
"That's one way of looking at it."
"That's what I wanted to talk to you about."
"This is what I wanted to talk to you about."
"Is that what it's about?"
"That's all you need."
"Can you give me a hand?"
"There's a first time for everything."
"That's why I came."
"Is that why you came?"
"I didn't ask him to come."
"What are you doing on the floor?"
"That's all that matters to me."
"Is anyone there?"
"There is someone in the house."
"I know there is someone."
"Is anyone home?"
"I think there is someone."
"What makes you think that?"
"What makes you think so?"
"There will be something for everyone."
"I don't have time to play."
"What are you doing that's beautiful?"
"I don't know anything about that."
"What do you know about women?"
"I know I can trust you."
"What are you looking at like that?"
"There was a gunshot."
"What did the doctor say?"
"What's on it?"
"Please don't do this."
"What do you think about this?"
"So what do you think?"
"Is that what you think of me?"
"You don't mean what you say."
"Are you thinking the same thing as me?"
"I know what you think of me."
"What do you think of me?"
"It could have happened to anyone."
"You never know what might happen."
"What will happen to me?"
"That's what we're trying to find out."
"So what do you say?"
"We have a lot to talk about."
"What is most important?"
"I know this is important to you."
"That's exactly what I'm going to do."
"That's exactly what I meant."
"That's exactly what he said."
"This is exactly what we need."
"What does that mean exactly?"
"This is exactly what I need."
"That's exactly what we're going to do."
"I see exactly what you mean."
"That's exactly what I was thinking."
"What did you think about it?"
"Good things come to those who wait."
"It's a matter of perspective."
"That's all I remember."
"He was here a minute ago."
"I'll only be a minute."
"Do you know who you remind me of?"
"You have no say in the matter."
"You only have to say the word."
"What's taking so long?"
"It's time to go home."
"At least, that's what I thought."
"What's going on there?"
"What are you doing there?"
"What is he doing there?"
"Do you think it's easy for me?"
"It's easy for you to say that."
"That's all I wanted to hear."
"That's exactly what I wanted to hear."
"It was nice to see you."
"It's always a pleasure to see you."
"It was nice to see you again."
"I think we've covered it."
"This is what you always wanted."
"What did he mean?"
"You did all you could."
"It was the least I could do."
"But what are you talking about?"
"What the hell are you doing with that?"
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"What the hell are you doing in my house?"
"What are you doing up there?"
"What's going on up there?"
"Maybe there is another way."
"There must be another way."
"That's how it all began."
"That's how it started."
"What's wrong with your face?"
"Listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you."
"What happened here?"
"It didn't happen like that."
"But what happened?"
"Please, please."
"I want to know what happened."
"And what happened?"
"So what happened?"
"Did you see what happened?"
"I know what happened."
"Tell me what happened."
"What happened that night?"
"Do you want to know what happened?"
"What if there isn't one?"
"I need to know what happened."
"That's exactly what happened."
"Please don't go."
"Tell me exactly what happened."
"What happened last night?"
"Do it for me, please."
"Do you know what happened?"
"What happened that day?"
"I know what you did for me."
"You don't know what you've done."
"That's all you have to do."
"I know that's what you want."
"Is that all I am to you?"
"I have told you everything I know."
"I told him not to do it."
"And that's why I'm here."
"Is that all you have to say?"
"That's all I can tell you."
"No, that's not what I mean."
"I'll tell you what I'm going to do."
"Can't or don't want to?"
"It's good, it's good, it's good."
"If it's not you, who is it?"
"Isn't that what you said?"
"No, that's not what I want."
"But what is this?"
"What is there to say?"
"I'll tell you what we're going to do."
"What are we going to do with you?"
"What are we going to do with him?"
"And what did you say to him?"
"What more can I do?"
"What's up with him?"
"What have you done for me?"
"And you know what he said to me?"
"What's over there?"
"What am I going to do with him?"
"So what is this?"
"What's wrong with you?"
"Yes, that's what I was told."
"Do you want to tell me what he did?"
"What do we care?"
"But what was that?"
"I don't know what he did."
"But what can I do about it?"
"That's all they told me."
"What do you care?"
"You know exactly what I mean."
"She has nothing to do with any of this."
"What is there to see?"
"But I'll see what I can do."
"What does this have to do with me?"
"And what does that matter to you?"
"What are you going to do with this?"
"What are you going to do with that?"
"And you, what are you doing here?"
"I do what I'm told to do."
"What is this again?"
"I'm here if you need me."
"We did what we had to do."
"You have to tell him that."
"There is something you must see."
"There is something I must do."
"What does he do for a living?"
"What am I doing with my life?"
"What did he do this time?"
"I've never seen anything like this in my life."
"I have never seen you in my life."
"What am I going to do without you?"
"That's what everyone tells me."
"Are you sure this is all yours?"
"That's what I want to talk to you about."
"You did what you had to do."
"What do you think I'm doing?"
"You think that's what I want?"
"Is this what I believe?"
"No, it's not what you think."
"What do you think it is?"
"No, I think it's always been you."
"Is that what I think it is?"
"My God, what are we going to do?"
"Is this what I think?"
"What did you just tell me?"
"What did I just tell you?"
"What does he mean by that?"
"There must be something that can be done."
"At home, you can do whatever you want."
"I have heard a lot of good things about you."
"That's a good thing, isn't it?"
"Because it's the right thing to do."
"This is the best."
"I know you did your best."
"What are you going to do with him?"
"And you, what are you going to do?"
"What aren't you telling me?"
"No, that's not what I'm saying."
"If you have something to say, say it."
"Tell me, what is it?"
"And what do you say to that?"
"Let me know if you need anything."
"Don't tell me what I already know."
"That's why I'm telling you."
"There is something you need to know."
"There is something you should know."
"You're going to tell me what I want to know."
"There is one thing you need to know."
"What is there to know?"
"Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
"Don't you want to know what it is?"
"There are things we don't do."
"What is this name?"
"It only happens once in a lifetime."
"No, that's not what I meant."
"That's why I wanted to talk to you."
"That's why I wanted to see you."
"Is that why you wanted to see me?"
"That's all I wanted to tell you."
"Do you think that's what I wanted?"
"What are you doing right now?"
"I don't think this is the time."
"What's going on between you?"
"Would you mind telling me what's going on?"
"What's going on with you two?"
"What's going on between you two?"
"You know very well what I mean."
"There's enough for everyone."
"What's going through your mind?"
"What's going on in your head?"
"Call me if you need anything."
"What are you two doing?"
"You see, that's what I'm talking about."
"Are you sure this is a good idea?"
"Do you have any idea what this is?"
"I think this is a very good idea."
"I'll tell you what's going to happen."
"How long has he been there?"
"I can get us out of this, but we have to go."
"Did you hear what I just said?"
"I told you to stay in the car."
"Is there anything I should know?"
"What is this question?"
"This is the last time you'll see me."
"What's this story all about?"
"I thought that's what you wanted."
"When was the last time you spoke to him?"
"I don't know what happened to him."
"You are the best thing that ever happened to me."
"This is the best thing that ever happened to me."
"What took you so long?"
"It's time to say goodbye."
"I told you everything I knew."
"What is this place?"
"Is there a place we can talk?"
"Are you sure this is the right place?"
"What do you have in your hand?"
"This is the first time this has happened to me."
"This is the first time I've seen this."
"This is the first time I've seen him."
"This is the first time I've done this."
"This is the first time I've seen her."
"This is the first time I've seen you."
"It's time to set the record straight."
"That's why I came here."
"That's what I came to tell you."
"What did he come here for?"
"What did you come here for?"
"What are you doing in my room?"
"It was the best night of my life."
"I have to give you a little bit of myself."
"I'm giving a friend a hand."
"Can someone tell me what's going on?"
"There is someone who wants to see you."
"If anyone can do it, it's you."
"There is someone who wants to talk to you."
"From someone who no longer needed it."
"Will someone tell me what's going on?"
"What is it, darling?"
"Is that how you want to play it?"
"This is the best day of my life."
"It was the best day of my life."
"Boss, what did he do to you?"
"Do you really think this is a good idea?"
"Is that why you called me?"
"That's why I called you."
"Don't you have anything more important to do?"
"And that's exactly what I'm going to do."
"That's exactly what I told him."
"You will do exactly what I tell you."
"You think I didn't think about that?"
"And everyone who had to deal with her."
"But you're going to impress them."
"Don't you see what's at stake?"
"I remember it like it was yesterday."
"That's the last thing I remember."
"What is the last thing you remember?"
"Do you remember what we said?"
"And that's all I remember."
"You think I don't want to?"
"We are men of the Night's Watch."
"Not everyone can say the same."
"I'll be here if you need me."
"I can't think of anything else."
"That's all I can think about."
"I think I'll go home."
"What are you looking at me for?"
"I don't think we have a choice."
"What's down there?"
"It's easier said than done."
"I want to hear what he has to say."
"It is a pleasure doing business with you."
"It's a pleasure doing business with you."
"So, I think I'll keep the rest."
"This is the last time we see each other."
"I'm sure there's something."
"I never meant for any of this to happen."
"If you don't do it, I will."
"If you don't, I will."
"I will do everything in my power."
"What are you doing here so early?"
"You will pay for what you did."
"He must pay for what he did."
"Are you talking to me like that?"
"We'll show them what we can do."
"What is it, my love?"
"What do you like about music?"
"Can I talk to you for a second?"
"No one had ever been so kind to me."
"What's up there?"
"What is there to understand?"
"I taught him everything he knows."
"The party started an hour ago."
"What happened to your face?"
"May I have your attention, please?"
"What happened there?"
"Do you want to tell me what happened?"
"You want to tell me what happened?"
"Can you tell me what happened?"
"I'll tell you what happened."
"I'll call you if there's anything new."
"Do you remember what happened?"
"That's how it happened."
"Can you tell us what happened?"
"Did anyone see what happened?"
"Are you going to tell me what happened?"
"What happened between you?"
"Please don't do this to me."
"You don't know what happened."
"My God, what happened?"
"But what happened here?"
"It's the only way out."
"Can I have your attention, please?"
"That's what I would do in his place."
"But we have to take care of him."
"It was the best thing that could have happened to him."
"Party with the king who's who?"
"Let's see if we can find you something to eat."
"What happened to your hair?"
"Children, we don't play in the street."
"What are you doing in the dark?"
"I think it happened to him by accident."
"There are millions of dollars at stake."
"You know that dream, it's always the same."
"There is something you should see."
"There is something else you should see."
"She won't have a child behind your back?"
"Can you tell me what it is?"
"So that's what it's all about?"
"And a chance for you to finish your journey."
"Because you don't know why or where you're going.'"
"You are free to do whatever you want."
"That's how we met."
"What do you want me to do?"
"Tell me what you want me to do."
"What do you want us to do?"
"What did you want me to do?"
"Is that what you want me to do?"
"What does he want me to do?"
"What do you think I can do for you?"
"We told you everything we knew."
"What's in there?"
"What happened in there?"
"If that's me in there, what am I?"
"Can someone explain to me what is going on?"
"I think I'll follow you this time."
"What could that possibly mean?"
"It's time to end this mission."
"He knows how to behave, you can trust him."
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"When was the last time you saw her?"
"I've never seen him in my life."
"I've never seen her in my life."
"I told you, I don't know."
"It's on the other side of town."
"I've never seen him like this."
"Is that all it does to you?"
"Is that why you did it?"
"I had never seen him in my life."
"There is love in the air."
"My mother told me that."
"Can I ask you a question?"
"He shot himself in the head."
"It's the best thing that ever happened to me."
"How long have we known each other?"
"I swear on my mother's life."
"The law of supply and demand."
"Without the Council's agreement, if necessary."
"Do you think I'm sending you to the cops for me?"
"I swear it on my mother's grave."
"What makes you feel this way?"
"It's said at the end of the song."
"There is something different about you."
"Tonight you have to write him a real letter."
"Remember what I told you."
"I told you not to come here."
"I told you everything I know."
"It's good to have you home."
"I told you not to do it."
"Is there a doctor in the room?"
"I love you, I love you, I love you."
"Did you hear what I said?"
"Did you hear what I told you?"
"That's why I like you."
"Isn't there another way?"
"Do you know what you look like now?"
"I just wanted to tell you that I love you."
"This is the friend I told you about."
"That's why I'm telling you about it."
"What's on the other side?"
"What did I tell you already?"
"I told you not to go."
"How are we going to do this?"
"This is the guy I told you about."
"Did you see what he did to me?"
"This is the girl I told you about."
"Did he say anything to you?"
"Did you do what I told you?"
"Please don't go away."
"What happened to you last night?"
"I saw you talking to a pretty girl."
"I told you not to do that."
"I told you I didn't know."
"You know I love you more than anything."
"I've never known anyone like you."
"It's like I've known you forever."
"I'll tell you anything you want to know."
"I'll tell you everything you want to know."
"You who have the gift, what have you seen?"
"It means being ready to return to society."
"Is that why you left me?"
"What can I say to that?"
"It would be a new beginning, in a new world."
"What is that noise?"
"I can bring everyone back to life."
"The future is so much more interesting than the past."
"I'm only the second son after all."
"The story takes place in a men's restroom."
"Did you tell him what role you played?"
"What else can I do?"
"What else is there?"
"I mistook you for someone else."
"What else could it be?"
"What else could I do?"
"What else did he say?"
"What else can we do?"
"He'll be here any minute."
"They'll be here any minute."
"It's time to go to school."
"What else can I say?"
"I have never seen anything so beautiful."
"I thought we had an agreement."
"Have you told anyone else?"
"You have nothing else to tell me?"
"What are we going to do with her?"
"How do you think this one should be played?"
"I have nowhere else to go."
"For that, I have to become someone else."
"I have no one else to talk to."
"It was over a year ago."
"Gold, silver, other girls."
"You must mistake me for someone else."
"And you're lucky to be here."
"I told you to wait in the car."
"What are we going to do with them?"
"She'll be here any minute."
"Even when we're off duty, we keep the same spirit."
"Captain, you told him to open his mouth."
"What is written there?"
"Have you told anyone else about this?"
"There is so much love in this house."
"What else did she say?"
"There was so much love in that house."
"I totally agree with you."
"I thought it was someone else."
"What else can you do?"
"What else is there to say?"
"Can we talk about something else?"
"Where do I know all this from?"
"He seems like a good guy."
"Do you have anything to say in your defense?"
"Anything special to eat that night?"
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"What am I supposed to do now?"
"I wanted to apologize for earlier."
"They are not interested in anything we have."
"Have I ever told you I love you?"
"I turn around, there are lots of cops outside."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please."
"That's why we came here."
"What are you trying to tell me?"
"There is nothing to be proud of."
"I didn't expect that at all."
"What are these stories?"
"That's all I can offer you."
"This is how I make my living."
"Pass me the big stone, the one that looks like you."
"I'm glad you told me."
"The longest summer in living memory."
"Thank you for allowing me to know myself better."
"What if there is no taxi?"
"Courage is the best defense you have left."
"I was told you wanted to see me."
"I was told you wanted to talk to me."
"I'll be right back."
"I need you."
"What is it about?"
"I told you."
"I told you so."
"I'll be right there."
"It's a long story."
"See you later."
"I changed my mind."
"Who is speaking?"
"Do you remember me?"
"I'll take care of it."
"I am proud of you."
"I love you too."
"I have a better idea."
"What is his name?"
"I don't remember."
"I heard about it."
"That's out of the question."
"I'm proud of you."
"I've already done it."
"I have to go to the bathroom."
"I want to go home."
"It didn't work."
"Just like old times."
"I have an appointment."
"Everything in its own time."
"This is good news."
"Yes, please."
"What is her name?"
"I need money."
"You'll be okay."
"I don't like him."
"We'll talk about it later."
"This is the only way."
"I got your message."
"He told me."
"It looks good."
"I have to talk to you."
"We're going home."
"Make yourself comfortable."
"I have made my decision."
"Do you want something to drink?"
"I've been looking for you everywhere."
"Did it go well?"
"I found something."
"She told me."
"You haven't changed."
"What's that noise?"
"I take care of everything."
"Where did you get that from?"
"Is everyone ready?"
"I'll be there in a minute."
"This way, please."
"I have money."
"I'll call you later."
"Sorry I'm late."
"What did you expect?"
"What is that smell?"
"You don't remember?"
"No, please."
"This is the only solution."
"This is not normal."
"It's important to me."
"Yes, I remember."
"We have company."
"I'm going for a walk."
"I'll be back in a minute."
"Because I love you."
"This is the first time."
"I've seen this before."
"One moment, please."
"This is a good start."
"I have good news."
"I'm going to take a shower."
"Look me in the eyes."
"See you there."
"So be it."
"I'll explain later."
"I'm going to be late."
"I've heard that before."
"Please come in."
"Come in, please."
"I'll keep you posted."
"They are everywhere."
"I have to go home."
"You have to trust me."
"How old is she?"
"I'll take care of him."
"Where did you find it?"
"I've heard enough."
"Can I buy you a drink?"
"I've seen it before."
"He's a good boy."
"I need air."
"I took care of it."
"I have all the time in the world."
"You already said it."
"I swear to God."
"I knew you would come."
"I didn't know anything about it."
"I don't love you."
"I can take care of it."
"We'll take care of it."
"You don't recognize me?"
"Do you remember that?"
"How old is he?"
"Do you have money?"
"I always knew it."
"I need time."
"I'm lucky."
"We'll see that later."
"I trust you."
"The pleasure is mine."
"That's a lot of money."
"I'll call you back later."
"Yes, I did."
"It won't happen again."
"Do you have a better idea?"
"Got a better idea?"
"I'll take care of that."
"We're going to have fun."
"We will find a solution."
"I decide."
"Do you want some water?"
"There is a difference."
"I remember you."
"Do you want me to come?"
"I should have known."
"Would you like something to drink?"
"It looks delicious."
"It's been a long day."
"You will tell me so much."
"You can count on me."
"I'm happy for you."
"Do you mind?"
"It's a nice name."
"I owe you one."
"I owe you an apology."
"How could this happen?"
"I'm going to get some fresh air."
"You've already done it."
"You're going to be late."
"What is this circus?"
"He was shot."
"You have visitors."
"Absolutely agree."
"I did some research."
"You can trust me."
"I met someone."
"I'll take care of the rest."
"That's what matters."
"I didn't think so."
"Don't you know?"
"Oh, please."
"I don't want to."
"Do you want me to leave?"
"You want me to leave?"
"Did he tell you?"
"You didn't know that?"
"I made a decision."
"Here, this is for you."
"I need to know."
"Do you want to eat something?"
"Back to square one."
"Did you have a good trip?"
"Better late than never."
"She'll be okay."
"May I have your attention?"
"I'll call the police."
"I was just saying."
"You look good."
"I haven't seen it."
"You told me."
"I knew it would happen."
"No, I'll take care of it."
"I'm on your side."
"He is my best friend."
"I just found out."
"What am I getting involved in?"
"I have to get out of here."
"It looks nice."
"Don't be late."
"Do you remember him?"
"I have another idea."
"I count to three."
"It is private property."
"Did everything go well?"
"May he rest in peace."
"And I did."
"See you tonight."
"I would never do that."
"He is in the hospital."
"I didn't understand."
"You always have been."
"She's my best friend."
"Nice to meet you."
"What's the plan?"
"It made me happy."
"Thanks for reminding me."
"Did something happen?"
"It's a beautiful day."
"I want you."
"I want you to leave."
"I heard something."
"You don't have to."
"Would you do that for me?"
"Yes, I saw it."
"This is a good plan."
"It looks awesome."
"You have to go."
"It is a great honor."
"I had a dream."
"I remember everything."
"It wasn't planned."
"This is the most important thing."
"It is a free country."
"I'm going to make some coffee."
"Right on target."
"I always have been."
"There is a knock at the door."
"In the flesh."
"The witness is yours."
"I didn't ask for anything."
"What am I supposed to do?"
"I'll keep you up-to-date."
"You have a new message."
"I knew you would come back."
"I quite agree."
"I'll take care of her."
"You are my best friend."
"Who is it?"
"I don't know exactly."
"Can I have an autograph?"
"Can't it wait?"
"I didn't ask."
"Space, the final frontier."
"Did I say something?"
"What did you talk about?"
"What are you looking at?"
"I have something for you."
"What do you say?"
"I didn't do it."
"What are they doing?"
"What does that change?"
"I already told you."
"I'll be a minute."
"What do I look like?"
"No, it isn't."
"No, she isn't."
"It's as simple as that."
"I have a gift for you."
"Your attention, please."
"I have a surprise for you."
"The pleasure is all mine."
"I know how you feel."
"I've never seen him."
"I'd better go."
"What brings you here?"
"What are we waiting for?"
"I want to show you something."
"I'm glad to see you."
"I need a drink."
"I was lucky."
"What has changed?"
"We have to go."
"I did my best."
"What do I have?"
"Do you want me to tell you?"
"You want me to tell you?"
"That's what I was saying."
"It's stronger than me."
"The sooner the better."
"I need a favor."
"You said it yourself."
"What was I saying?"
"I have things to do."
"I'm so proud of you."
"What will happen?"
"That's about it."
"My head is spinning."
"Look what I found."
"If you'll excuse me."
"What do you want me to say?"
"Neither."
"I asked you a question."
"That's ancient history."
"No, you're not."
"No, you are not."
"There are others."
"This is just the beginning."
"What were you doing?"
"It's the least we can do."
"I hope you're right."
"I hope you are right."
"What do you believe?"
"What are you looking for?"
"Can I talk to you for a minute?"
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
"What are you reading?"
"Is that clear?"
"It's nice to see you."
"That's what I feared."
"It seems to be okay."
"Let me ask you a question."
"What happened next?"
"I did it for you."

"Easier said than done."
"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"No, I haven't seen it."
"I would do anything for you."
"Where does it come from?"
"I'm the one asking the questions."
"It's good to be back."
"Don't you remember me?"
"Thank you for saving my life."

"What are you hiding from me?"
"There is a beginning to everything."
"That's what I was going to say."
"I was going to ask you the same question."
"What's stopping you?"
"There is no cure."
"What did I do to deserve this?"
"I didn't think you'd come."
"I didn't think you would come."
"Is it a boy or a girl?"
"I heard gunshots."
"How do you expect me to know?"
"I tried to tell you."
"Where did you learn to do that?"
"That's what they all say."
"I'm so glad to see you."
"What do I do with it?"
"It was a pleasure to meet you."
"See you on the other side."
"This is not love."
"I'm glad you came."
"I have what I need."
"It's time to get up."
"That's easy for you to say."
"What are you telling me?"
"That's exactly what I'm saying."
"Do I have a choice?"

"This is where it all began."
"What are you singing to me?"
"I don't know anything about this."
"That's exactly what I think."

"You are the love of my life."
"It was a pleasure meeting you."
"I just wanted you to know."
"Water, please."
"I'll be with you in a moment."

"Do you want me to take care of it?"
"You never told me."
"What is it, my dear?"
"Is there anyone in there?"
"I have a little gift for you."
"I have some questions for you."
"I could ask you the same question."
"Tell me what you think."
"Leave a message and I will call you back."

"What was he doing there?"
"Is that what you want to hear?"
"I did what you wanted."
"What will become of us?"
"I know what I did."
"What would make you happy?"
"Show me what you can do."
"Anyone else know?"
"That's very generous of you."
"I'm going to make some calls."
"You have the right to remain silent."
"It's the least I can do."
"I did what I could."
"That's the least we can say."
"It's time to go to bed."
"The more the merrier."
"You are meant for each other."
"It's the best I can do."
"You didn't answer my question."
"I know what it looks like."
"That's why I love you."
"I did what I had to do."
"That's what I like about you."
"That's what I'm trying to do."
"That's all I found."
"I need some time."
"I knew I could count on you."
"I have never felt so good."
"I need a hand."
"What's so important?"
"We are made for each other."
"I did everything I could."

"And that's what I did."
"There were shots fired."
"That's exactly what I said."

"Yes, that's what I said."
"I have a phone call to make."
"What's going on in there?"
"This is what I always wanted."
"I will live the life I have chosen."
"What's inside?"
"What did you do to yourself?"
"So, what do you think?"
"I came as soon as I knew."
"I do what I have to do."
"I'm sorry about earlier."
"Is this how you thank me?"
"What have I done now?"
"It's good to be home."
"We need each other."
"I told you not to come."
"I think I found something."
"I came as soon as I could."
"What would I do without you?"
"I have so much to tell you."
"I love you more than anything in the world."
"But what did I do?"
"I have nothing else to do."
"I said I'd take care of it."
"What the hell got into you?"
"But what happened to you?"
"What are you trying to do?"
"What do you have to say in your defense?"
"How many times have I told you?"
"You told me that."
"You told me so."
"I know what you're trying to do."
"I should have told you sooner."
"I never stopped loving you."
"I've been waiting for this moment my whole life."
"That's all I did."

"I need you by my side."
"I learned what happened."
"What are you trying to say?"
"I saw what happened."

"Someone has to do it."
"There are ups and downs."
"I saw what I saw."
"He told me he loved me."
"You taught me that."
"What else do you have?"
"This place gives me goosebumps."
"What did they tell you?"
"I hope it's worth it."
"What's in the bag?"
"They don't know what they're doing."
"What else do we have?"
"I did what you asked."
"I've been thinking about you all day."
"He told me that."
"Do you want to know what I think about it?"
"There may be others."
"You know how I feel about you."
"What were you doing there?"
"That's all I saw."
"Do you need a hand?"
"That's what friends are for."
"Do you want me to tell you a secret?"
"I have never seen anything like it."
"You did it, didn't you?"
"That's what I understood."
"When did I say that?"
"God has nothing to do with it."
"There's someone inside."
"There has been a change of plan."
"It seems like yesterday."
"I thought you weren't coming."

"Not if I have a say in it."
"I will give you whatever you want."
"As we make our bed, we lie down."
"A man's life is at stake."
"I have some calls to make."
"What are we supposed to do?"

"This is what we are trying to find out."
"May I know what it is?"
"I only saw him once."
"There's a lot of money at stake."
"Let's see what you've got."
"Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?"
"Is that the best you can do?"
"How did you know I was here?"
"That's the difference between you and me."
"I told you not to move."
"That's what I had in mind."
"I saw what you did."
"What's in this bag?"
"Call me if there is anything new."
"I told him I loved him."
"I didn't ask your opinion."
"That's where you come in."
"That's what I said, right?"

"I thought about what you said."
"I should have done this a long time ago."
"I did what you told me."
"I hope you find what you are looking for."
"I pronounce you united in matrimony."
"I know because I invented it."
"I need you to do me a favor."
"I want you to do something for me."
"You're the only one I trust."

"Open the trunk."
"It was bound to happen."
"Did he speak?"
"That would be perfect."
"It may be."
"They are superb."
"There you are."
"Yes, you can."
"Here's the lowdown."
"Hey guys."
"They are them."
"Bring them in."
"I will be careful."
"That would be great."
"Show me that."
"What was he like?"
"Yeah, so what?"
"In the corner."
"It's locked."
"Look at me carefully."
"Let him do it."
"She came back."
"I think so too."
"Not like you."
"We have them."
"You swear?"
"We're going there."
"Why are you asking?"
"And your father?"
"Did you notice?"
"Have you noticed?"
"Do you have any?"
"I want to live."
"Do you want to drive?"
"Put on your seatbelt."
"It touches me."
"I would like that."
"But not you."
"Wait for my signal."
"It is harmless."
"Do you want to come up?"
"I waited."
"Full speed ahead."
"Does that suit you?"
"It will be perfect."
"We're having fun."
"Do you believe me?"
"Both of them."
"Can you read?"
"And what else?"
"He was here."
"It's strong."
"I am relieved."
"Stay with him."
"Not for you."
"We will meet again."
"I'm waiting outside."
"He knew it."
"Do we understand each other?"
"That was it."
"I was hungry."
"I have to try."
"I see clearly."
"She's better."
"I will contact you."
"It's secret."
"We'll take him away."
"Car accident."
"Far from here."
"And like that?"
"How does he do it?"
"Go see him."
"It's planned."
"Welcome home."
"In a few days."
"Thank you, my brother."
"Play is over."
"Oh, I understand."
"Come here, you."
"It's fast."
"Raise your hand."
"Can we talk?"
"It's clean."
"Come to my house."
"I would like to know."
"How was it?"
"It's surprising."
"Go change."
"She is resting."
"It's now."
"It looks like it, yes."
"Look over there."
"Whenever you want."
"We talked."
"We are here."
"Did you find it?"
"It seems to me."
"And school?"
"They are."
"We have it."
"We're on it."
"I'm coming to that."
"How do we do it?"
"I congratulate you."
"When was it?"
"She is wonderful."
"Why is that?"
"I slipped."
"Let me look."
"I'm sure."
"I want some."
"I'll be quick."
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Give it back to me."
"I will be brief."
"Can we leave?"
"My bad."
"You are gifted."
"Yes, I know."
"Can you explain to me?"
"A new beginning."
"He understood."
"Go get them."
"Who cares?"
"Please."
"Good and you?"
"Who are you looking for?"
"In the basement."
"Everything is good."
"In my arms."
"One more minute."
"I have you."
"I will find her."
"Right now?"
"It's big."
"Lots of things."
"I can."
"It's successful."
"How many of you are there?"
"How many are you?"
"It's finished."
"She is intelligent."
"It will be quick."
"I am American."
"Not for us."
"I'm going to hang up."
"It will be fun."
"Do you want to taste?"
"We're going to win."
"I recognize you."
"Where am I going?"
"Come on, that's enough."
"One by one."
"Let's go to bed."
"Tell you what?"
"I hear them."
"Are you together?"
"For years."
"Here are their stories."
"Let him come in."
"All my life."
"There he is."
"It's confirmed."
"On this side."
"I'm waiting here."
"In my pocket."
"I knew him."
"You'll be fine."
"I'm serious."
"He wakes up."
"We'll do it again."
"Of course, darling."
"Is that all?"
"I'm training."
"Be yourself."
"He's stuck."
"We love each other."
"I'm finished."
"I was young."
"He is old."
"Am I clear?"
"I believed it."
"She's cool."
"We're going."
"My little girl."
"How could I?"
"Don't tire yourself out."
"We remember."
"It's busy."
"Let's make a deal."
"This is the captain."
"Fasten your seatbelts."
"It's tomorrow."
"So tell me."
"Is it necessary?"
"They are getting closer."
"They are great."
"Do you like me?"
"In the closet."
"We're staying here."
"He came in."
"How do you say?"
"It's human."
"On the table."
"Yes, goodbye."
"He is smart."
"Turn left."
"I'm cool."
"There are many of them."
"Were you close?"
"He will be there."
"You were there."
"How much do you want?"
"But I do."
"You are great."
"And your husband?"
"You are handsome."
"When are we leaving?"
"I have everything."
"He came."
"Welcome."
"Let us pass."
"Do you want to go out?"
"Here and there."
"I was here."
"Let him talk."
"She is young."
"And guess what?"
"Who wants to start?"
"I want to come."
"Let's have a toast."
"The police are coming."
"For the money."
"I know, Mom."
"It's touching."
"I will find out."
"Where was she?"
"Not like me."
"I understand her."
"He has it."
"Do you know why?"
"It is stable."
"I understand well."
"Don't hesitate."
"Grow up a little."
"Were you looking for me?"
"No, listen to me."
"You can check."
"Come on, big guy."
"So, go ahead."
"Do you believe that?"
"I'm getting dressed."
"No, I'm sorry."
"I guessed."
"We are listening to you."
"You've grown up."
"And who knows?"
"And now what?"
"Ah, there it is."
"Stay behind me."
"It was interesting."
"He's screwed."
"In the street."
"I am a nurse."
"I will pay you."
"Yes, thank you very much."
"Should I wake you up?"
"Close the doors."
"Let's hope not."
"I am a virgin."
"At school."
"He's better."
"It's over."
"Who called?"
"You are wonderful."
"Empty your pockets."
"I should go home."
"Yeah, go ahead."
"She deserves it."
"Like a baby."
"You can go out."
"He deserves it."
"I understand, sir."
"Do you have them?"
"Turn right."
"Word of honor."
"More coffee?"
"We succeeded."
"Are you going there?"
"He's still breathing."
"Listen to me everyone."
"It's splendid."
"Shall we do it again?"
"I call them."
"For once."
"No network."
"Hold it tight."
"Just that?"
"Hey, guys."
"In a week."
"Not on the phone."
"And the car?"
"In a moment."
"That reassures me."
"I will come back tomorrow."
"Okay, guys."
"Is he serious?"
"All the more reason."
"One more question."
"They are delicious."
"He likes you."
"Well, well, well."
"You will do it."
"No one can."
"On the roof."
"We'll check."
"Did you like it?"
"Pass me that."
"In the trunk."
"I keep quiet."
"It's arranged."
"Can I stay?"
"Make your choice."
"He's getting closer."
"It was yesterday."
"I'm engaged."
"Good day, sir."
"Turn up the volume."
"And so do we."
"Now I know."
"It's classic."
"It's blocked."
"He arrived."
"Do it, you."
"Are you leaving me?"
"How do you feel?"
"I'm going with him."
"Is that enough for you?"
"You are strong."
"Have a nice weekend."
"Move out of there."
"I'll call."
"Nothing extraordinary."
"They know it."
"A boyfriend?"
"Just the two of us."
"Hold me tight."
"You are smart."
"This is the truth."
"He's outside."
"How would I know?"
"Call me tomorrow."
"I am an actor."
"How are you doing?"
"Let's have a drink."
"Are you busy?"
"Oh, yes, yes."
"Maybe less."
"Who are we?"
"Nothing works."
"Hello everyone."
"Did you love him?"
"Raise your head."
"Hello to you."
"Raise your arms."
"It is loaded."
"What will you do?"
"Let's go see this."
"Are you getting there?"
"I'm awake."
"Look at this place."
"And my father?"
"I'm waiting for him."
"It's complete."
"I am realistic."
"Don't push."
"She was beautiful."
"Welcome among us."
"And your day?"
"Scout's word."
"I would have liked."
"She will."
"Keep me informed."
"Are you spying on me?"
"I'll call him."
"Here's the deal."
"We call each other."
"Have you heard?"
"I will wait for you."
"They were there."
"What does she say?"
"And the police?"
"Rest in peace."
"You know everything."
"I promised."
"We will be there."
"I'm coming from there."
"It's nobody."
"Keep moving forward."
"Now you know."
"Maybe two."
"Let's walk a little."
"Thanks be to God."
"I will ask him."
"Hello, sweetie."
"Not another word."
"I know, Dad."
"In his office."
"A little everywhere."
"An old friend."
"Very good question."
"How am I doing?"
"Yes, actually."
"I'm watching you."
"Are you up for it?"
"You don't want to?"
"I am rich."
"Get in there."
"You do it."
"Sure and certain."
"What's wrong with her?"
"You know well."
"I survived."
"They are waiting for us."
"It will get better."
"Do you hear yourself?"
"Where and when?"
"Would you like to come inside?"
"Yes, but why?"
"No, actually."
"Not for a second."
"It's dark."
"We won."
"Let's go talk to him."
"I went out."
"That was before."
"How is mom?"
"You are different."
"And your family?"
"Can you help me?"
"We will find her."
"You had to say it."
"I knew her."
"You have to eat."
"With what money?"
"She is great."
"Go this way."
"We will call you."
"Need anything?"
"A good man."
"Can we start?"
"Can I come by?"
"He likes it."
"She is innocent."
"She is lovely."
"Do you hear them?"
"How do you know?"
"He is everywhere."
"And him too."
"Do it now."
"It will be nice."
"Facing the wall."
"We stay together."
"It's genetic."
"He is wonderful."
"Not for that."
"She is sexy."
"Not once."
"Let's go this way."
"Who is 'they'?"
"Let's go see him."
"It has begun."
"It's midnight."
"I am honored."
"So do it."
"One more."
"But what about?"
"Take a chair."
"At the airport."
"Yes my love."
"I am me."
"He is tall."
"Can you come?"
"I see everything."
"I'm going back to work."
"You have to come."
"When do I start?"
"She's waiting for you."
"She is waiting for you."
"Take one."
"Make a wish."
"It was open."
"Yes, right there."
"No, that's enough."
"Take the money."
"It was dark."
"They are waiting for me."
"She's stuck."
"Thank you, my darling."
"Go ahead, try it."
"He'll get over it."
"You are here."
"It's Saturday."
"A few more minutes."
"Well, goodbye."
"Hello, guys."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Do your job."
"Eat something."
"Room service."
"I guess so."
"Take mine."
"Where is what?"
"He is resting."
"It's comforting."
"And you, sir?"
"She has changed."
"Look at this one."
"Sooner or later."
"It's clear."
"Do you feel it?"
"He is a doctor."
"Every man for himself."
"I'm finding out."
"Yeah, very good."
"What did you want?"
"Don't you get it?"
"How do you find it?"
"But I understand."
"Truth or Dare?"
"Do the math."
"In a safe place."
"In my bag."
"Repeat after me."
"She's going to love it."
"Okay, that's enough."
"What was he doing?"
"I believe so too."
"Word for word."
"I will tell them."
"Speak for yourself."
"Any one."
"In which direction?"
"I am terrified."
"It was excellent."
"We let it go."
"No more secrets."
"Yes, we can."
"How is it?"
"My best friend."
"I am good."
"Good evening, my dear."
"Bring him here."
"I had it."
"You're amazing."
"It's known."
"You can come in."
"Do you want them?"
"How much is that?"
"Who's in charge here?"
"By doing what?"
"Welcome to my home."
"Thanks for the tip."
"And his mother?"
"No rush."
"I will find you."
"You look like him."
"We are fine."
"We'll get them."
"But me too."
"It was impressive."
"He confessed."
"I'm clean."
"It has changed."
"And my mother?"
"That's enough now."
"He is absent."
"In the back."
"How was I?"
"Get some rest."
"He is hungry."
"It was there."
"Try to sleep."
"I have to stay."
"What is he?"
"It will be great."
"We take it."
"Oh, but yes."
"I am you."
"Hi, friend."
"Go see her."
"Are we going to eat?"
"You learn quickly."
"I'm going to clean."
"So what about this?"
"They entered."
"Oh, there it is."
"Tomorrow, maybe."
"Maybe tomorrow."
"Can I go out?"
"Were you there?"
"She was pregnant."
"Welcome to our home."
"He is right."
"Hello, girls."
"That's smart."
"It was magical."
"What a pleasant surprise."
"Obviously."
"Thank you, but no."
"Everything is calm."
"Come on, say it."
"Very, very good."
"How much do you have?"
"That would be wonderful."
"Not without you."
"To protect you."
"And you are?"
"You are fantastic."
"It's recent."
"Keep your eyes open."
"It was over."
"Countdown."
"Does this amuse you?"
"Not with you."
"How is dad?"
"I want more."
"I'm going to come."
"Everything is clear."
"I looked."
"Look at that."
"Watch your head."
"I imagine so."
"Can we go home?"
"Give your hand."
"It was planned."
"He is excellent."
"Because what?"
"You're good."
"Can I play?"
"A good guy."
"And after that?"
"Let us do it."
"Very good choice."
"We'll work it out."
"It belongs to me."
"I'm a fan."
"But who knows?"
"They follow us."
"Do you want to drink?"
"I can come back."
"In the woods."
"Put it there."
"It's French."
"What are they?"
"The weather is nice."
"We are the same."
"They are cute."
"Do you know how to drive?"
"I would know."
"Goodbye, doctor."
"Let's go then."
"Look over here."
"Is that yes?"
"She is new."
"It's honest."
"Password?"
"Yes, we know."
"I mean."
"I can't hear."
"Or something else."
"She is different."
"Who was there?"
"Come back later."
"Yeah, indeed."
"In the hallway."
"Goodbye, gentlemen."
"Ice."
"You belong to me."
"But why me?"
"The baby is coming."
"Upstairs."
"It was obvious."
"Double or nothing."
"That was all."
"I could have."
"In five minutes."
"Let me introduce myself."
"It will be good."
"He is clean."
"Hi, boys."
"I came."
"Okay, goodbye."
"Gunshot."
"Yes, my dear."
"I'm outside."
"He is happy."
"Are you putting me back together?"
"Nothing changes."
"This is getting interesting."
"Change of plans."
"Don't go out."
"How did you know?"
"Is he there?"
"I receive you."
"Yeah, I understand."
"Man or woman?"
"Music."
"Day and night."
"Our deepest condolences."
"And mine?"
"And the woman?"
"In the office."
"I want them."
"You've come to the right place."
"He is fast."
"He is in love."
"She's outside."
"He started."
"I believe her."
"We have to go home."
"Wait for me outside."
"Just one glass."
"Nothing is going right."
"Not at first."
"They are adorable."
"It is mandatory."
"Come see mom."
"I learned."
"Stay in position."
"He had better."
"Go get her."
"And his wife?"
"I get up."
"In the bag."
"I'll start."
"I'm leaving now."
"She died."
"Not by me."
"It might be useful."
"She is awake."
"Where is she going?"
"You can go."
"Yes, my father."
"She's there."
"Can I drive?"
"That's going to change."
"It disgusts me."
"It was lovely."
"Go around."
"I'll be outside."
"She is huge."
"It was superb."
"I tripped."
"I am different."
"Bring him to me."
"How many men?"
"I entered."
"Are you a journalist?"
"A little boy."
"Call the cops."
"We're leaving tomorrow."
"In two days."
"Not for him."
"Happy for you."
"That's reasonable."
"Seventeen years old."
"Who is for?"
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"People are talking."
"I can't."
"Beer."
"Do you want to stay?"
"They came back."
"He called."
"I would be there."
"Yes, it's fine."
"He moved."
"For both of you."
"Take off your pants."
"Oh yeah, really?"
"He was kind."
"Here you are at last."
"You are pregnant."
"Very well, madam."
"We're going to talk."
"That was nice."
"No, not there."
"He looks like you."
"Do you miss him?"
"Get them out."
"Go ahead, talk."
"Were you waiting for me?"
"I'll be fine."
"Face to face."
"Shall we have lunch together?"
"You can talk."
"It will be easy."
"Don't listen to him."
"Show it to me."
"They know everything."
"I'm going to go in."
"Don't come."
"It is closed."
"He is great."
"He died."
"Take a tour."
"We know each other."
"And your brother?"
"Stay with her."
"What will you take?"
"And that's it?"
"What do you feel?"
"Do you want to leave?"
"Not at my place."
"Now listen to me."
"Who spoke?"
"He won."
"Soon, I hope."
"Who started it?"
"Are you in a hurry?"
"I feel it."
"I hear well."
"And so does she."
"As much as possible."
"No photos."
"And the family?"
"When is he coming back?"
"I will be good."
"They have it."
"Since this morning."
"Hi, you two."
"My ex-wife."
"Hello, friends."
"Keep walking."
"Don't get me wrong."
"Get in line."
"And do what?"
"She succeeded."
"We were friends."
"Stay back."
"Come to me."
"A little drink?"
"Yes, that too."
"She is splendid."
"If you allow me."
"I am divorced."
"We are brothers."
"My old friend."
"You're home."
"Come on, get to work."
"I'm changing."
"We're a team."
"It's common."
"Thank you, friend."
"Welcome everyone."
"Are you waiting for me?"
"Hello, my love."
"We will get there."
"Let them pass."
"You did great."
"Here and now."
"Wait, guys."
"It excites me."
"Go have fun."
"It's green."
"I am a psychiatrist."
"Can you move?"
"Hi, handsome."
"Can I finish?"
"He passed."
"Look at this guy."
"The door slams."
"And then what?"
"Here for you."
"It's Thursday."
"I can handle it."
"I'm replacing him."
"Hello, young man."
"I respect you."
"Do you excuse us?"
"Shall we have dinner together?"
"Get him out."
"I have decided."
"Let us go."
"Please follow us."
"How is she?"
"Go wash yourself."
"It will be necessary."
"It's noon."
"Is he here?"
"She is fantastic."
"Not my type."
"It will be."
"She will be."
"Do you want it?"
"You tried."
"In two weeks."
"Oh, look at this."
"I greet you."
"They have arrived."
"You can."
"Are you taking me?"
"Sorry about that."
"Who was she?"
"We must eat."
"I paid."
"I walk past."
"And not you?"
"Stay a little longer."
"I am human."
"Who is responsible?"
"Stay like that."
"He tried."
"There were two of them."
"They are nice."
"Shall we kiss?"
"Are you a lawyer?"
"In two hours."
"And the girls?"
"Who was he?"
"I will write to you."
"Another day."
"I grew up."
"She knows everything."
"I would have tried."
"It's fair."
"Do you believe her?"
"Are you high?"
"He's going to love it."
"How many were there?"
"Take off your shoes."
"Yes, on the contrary."
"He deserved it."
"It was real."
"You have to choose."
"To protect me."
"He knows me."
"Take a picture."
"Can I touch?"
"It's small."
"Please stand up."
"Each to their own."
"And why is that?"
"How can you?"
"Any last words?"
"Are you not sleeping?"
"It was right."
"She was sick."
"But it will be fine."
"And women?"
"Let's go get her."
"Don't be shy."
"Will you do it?"
"You are welcome."
"What do you prefer?"
"In due time."
"It's going to happen."
"She is unconscious."
"I learn quickly."
"For you too."
"He is rich."
"And the child?"
"We concentrate."
"It was late."
"It was cute."
"Who says it?"
"Yes, one second."
"But not too much."
"Go ahead, keep going."
"In theory, yes."
"Not so good."
"It works well."
"No children."
"I'll make it work."
"This is unforgivable."
"I want to play."
"Here's the money."
"There, you see?"
"I'll make it up to you."
"In the garden."
"We'll talk about it."
"Don't stay there."
"You would be surprised."
"I'm new."
"Yes, whatever."
"He is behind."
"It was extraordinary."
"You can begin."
"He ran away."
"Wherever you want."
"You can't."
"What is she?"
"This explains that."
"For eternity."
"And you, then?"
"I don't find it."
"Nothing at all."
"That doesn't work either."
"Good luck, Jim."
"You have to believe."
"You are cute."
"I know how to read."
"The other side."
"Yes, my lieutenant."
"The cops are coming."
"You see clearly."
"I know, thank you."
"Does this speak to you?"
"Are you dating?"
"Go ahead then."
"You love it."
"Do you miss her?"
"He is free."
"I'm hiding."
"I will join you."
"I am honest."
"Someone is approaching."
"He is hiding."
"We've got you."
"Where is Tony?"
"He was good."
"I respect him."
"On the side."
"Not this one."
"Like your father."
"Why come here?"
"Let's go now."
"You are lucky."
"He is charming."
"I want to try."
"Like my father."
"Hey, look at this."
"It's mind-blowing."
"A little advice."
"They are looking for you."
"Not to you."
"Stay the course."
"Not the least."
"I want to dance."
"Explain that to me."
"I'm in it."
"I am Jewish."
"She is happy."
"He is a lawyer."
"And my son?"
"My grandfather."
"Not from me."
"Let's go to my house."
"Yeah, I see."
"Do what is necessary."
"Do your thing."
"I will teach you."
"No, stay here."
"I am a vegetarian."
"And what about us?"
"Now I understand."
"Are you on drugs?"
"And something else."
"This is the situation."
"We will find them."
"I know that."
"Food."
"Thank you, you too."
"I can change."
"I'm going to change."
"Just this once."
"For what reasons?"
"They are outside."
"I felt it."
"I want this."
"What was I like?"
"I have class."
"How many fingers?"
"Are you hiding?"
"Here is the address."
"Spread your legs."
"He's done for."
"Let me drive."
"She is old."
"Do you want to watch?"
"Come on, do it."
"I am a teacher."
"You must understand."
"You have to understand."
"Who lives here?"
"I was terrified."
"Same for you."
"In the middle of the night?"
"And you two?"
"Dad came home."
"Who, me?"
"What are they like?"
"Who is following me?"
"Don't smile."
"It was mean."
"Get her out."
"That will be all."
"Thank you, sweetie."
"I'll be home late."
"You have an interest."
"It's admirable."
"She is special."
"And his father?"
"Keep your distance."
"Where will we go?"
"It's comfortable."
"You are sexy."
"God keep you."
"To serve you."
"I want to understand."
"It's sweet."
"Yeah, you too."
"This weekend?"
"It is delicious."
"Have you had dinner?"
"And the father?"
"That makes two."
"I was thirsty."
"Reinforcements are arriving."
"And his family?"
"In the house."
"At this time?"
"I am an adult."
"I admire you."
"Of course, Dad."
"I say it."
"It's cooked."
"Hello, my son."
"Do you know him?"
"This is Ben."
"You're back."
"A little better."
"Go talk to him."
"I want to talk."
"Eighteen years old."
"Everything is said."
"Go ahead, man."
"There are three of them."
"We are being watched."
"It's going to get hot."
"No alcohol."
"Yes, that one."
"I'm looking for him."
"Come on, to bed."
"I am a volunteer."
"Please forgive me."
"You come home late."
"It's new."
"He's in it."
"No question."
"At what price?"
"Who is asking for it?"
"We've got her."
"Let's talk about you."
"No phone."
"I'll be there soon."
"Take off your jacket."
"And the job?"
"Yeah, good idea."
"Neither does she."
"A great man."
"I'm teasing you."
"She is stable."
"I'll fix that."
"We are hungry."
"Completely agree."
"Welcome to America."
"Watch out for the steps."
"I chose."
"Good day, gentlemen."
"I knocked."
"It is necessary."
"How many people?"
"It happens sometimes."
"Get plenty of rest."
"He loved you."
"Go ahead, darling."
"He's fair."
"He is small."
"Go ahead, tell us."
"This is essential."
"But you, yes."
"About a year."
"You are sublime."
"Take a little aim."
"I'm terrified."
"Let him wait."
"Are you sincere?"
"Take the car."
"It's burning hot."
"She's burning hot."
"It's Halloween."
"My God, yes."
"Easy as pie."
"Good night, madam."
"Yes, and you?"
"Did you call?"
"I'm getting off here."
"We have to get out of here."
"Everything will change."
"Everything is closed."
"I am Catholic."
"Do you know this?"
"You know that?"
"I understand them."
"You or me?"
"He loves her."
"She is hot."
"Trust you?"
"So do this."
"I'm excited."
"I counted."
"Come back and see us."
"It's great."
"The whole truth."
"I searched."
"I'll ask."
"Is it seen?"
"Will you call me?"
"What, what, what?"
"I'm getting ready."
"It is correct."
"What do you choose?"
"Thank you, I appreciate it."
"She is shy."
"This is the story."
"Nice day, huh?"
"Just a few minutes."
"And my brother?"
"We will contact you."
"It brings luck."
"Very well, gentlemen."
"Do you promise me?"
"This is the result."
"We are partners."
"All right, listen."
"She belongs to me."
"Ah, very good."
"Do you like them?"
"I will be here."
"Good morning my love."
"Hello my love."
"It's Thanksgiving."
"He loved me."
"Well, good night."
"Let them do it."
"Go on without me."
"What did they want?"
"What am I looking for?"
"It is heavy."
"Next month."
"We have some."
"It's deserved."
"You are being unfair."
"Where is Ben?"
"Exit the vehicle."
"And your son?"
"I have arrived."
"She will be there."
"I was thinking about it."
"Nothing interesting."
"She was kind."
"You're toast."
"Do you recognize them?"
"They came."
"It was hot."
"You too."
"Let's go there."
"Let's turn around."
"A long story."
"And look at this."
"These two."
"What to do now?"
"For a while."
"At the same time?"
"I would have preferred."
"Slow down a little."
"It cut out."
"Where was I?"
"Think about what?"
"It's late."
"We are friends."
"This is encouraging."
"Hello, my pretty."
"You're doing well."
"Here's my number."
"He was fine."
"Don't try."
"What are you eating?"
"It's positive."
"She was here."
"Hi, Mom."
"How much is it worth?"
"He left."
"I gave up."
"We are close."
"Do you recognize that?"
"She is excellent."
"But why not?"
"I freaked out."
"It's won."
"You will have them."
"He goes there."
"He adores you."
"Last year."
"With your permission."
"We found it."
"Am I?"
"Do you really want to?"
"She was good."
"Do you understand now?"
"It's Friday."
"But you do."
"The world is changing."
"Go ahead, come in."
"You are asked."
"You should have."
"Make yourself useful."
"Come on, my darling."
"It does."
"He was there."
"Good night, gentlemen."
"On the couch."
"You will be."
"She understood."
"Yes, but how?"
"It's canceled."
"We're going to dance."
"With all due respect."
"For children."
"I understand why."
"I remind him."
"It will be me."
"He's hot."
"You're gone."
"Do it like this."
"You can go home."
"Where do you work?"
"He stays here."
"Only two more."
"We'll come back to that."
"Turn the page."
"Thanks, I'll be fine."
"I can imagine."
"Easy, guys."
"He's fine."
"Reach out."
"She's waiting for me."
"Hello at your place."
"Well, I hope so."
"It's Tuesday."
"We are engaged."
"We're engaged."
"Thank you, girls."
"Come get her."
"Come aboard."
"Well done, man."
"Give this to him."
"You're going to be great."
"Play the game."
"So, good luck."
"He is sexy."
"You are brave."
"Come kiss me."
"Here are the keys."
"He grew up."
"Yes, it works."
"She likes it."
"This is Tony."
"That's brave."
"No one answers."
"But what to do?"
"He is pretty."
"Did you speak?"
"It's full."
"More than one."
"Be more specific."
"Yes, it seems."
"Are you going to answer?"
"How else to do it?"
"Are you friends?"
"In a few minutes."
"This is Ted."
"They will."
"Good, my captain."
"Have you had lunch?"
"Can you drive?"
"I will be ready."
"A little smile."
"There's someone."
"But it will come."
"I'm still waiting."
"I don't drink."
"Lock the door."
"Take your coat."
"I appreciate that."
"Date of birth?"
"Kirk to Enterprise."
"Me, for example."
"I protect you."
"It's divine."
"Pay close attention."
"I know how."
"But not him."
"This is Nick."
"Where are they?"
"We are different."
"I'm going to play."
"At this point?"
"On the road."
"Watch and learn."
"My little boy."
"Can you hear us?"
"In your room."
"At first, yes."
"They were right."
"She loved me."
"Everything is planned."
"Tell him, you."
"Are we ready?"
"And another one."
"Are you American?"
"Here is the plan."
"About an hour."
"I'll wait here."
"This is Billy."
"She is cold."
"Is it essential?"
"It's starting well."
"Just a few questions."
"Don't ask me."
"In the truck."
"I am fast."
"Just a few days."
"It still works."
"I hoped so."
"She loves him."
"You, for example."
"In the water."
"Is it him?"
"Can you swim?"
"Not on me."
"You are a doctor."
"In this case."
"Go ahead, you."
"And your work?"
"I'll look for it."
"Hello, my darling."
"What you say."
"But me, yes."
"And my wife?"
"Are we going to have lunch?"
"Breakfast."
"They are innocent."
"Of course, madam."
"Consider yourself lucky."
"It will never work."
"In my head."
"He is special."
"She arrived."
"You want this?"
"Drop it."
"What are you hiding?"
"What are we celebrating?"
"No locker."
"No papers."
"We knew it."
"Trust him."
"Very well, yes."
"Are you satisfied?"
"Two, three, four."
"Say my name."
"Can I speak?"
"I'll catch up with you."
"For your own good."
"He is black."
"One of the best."
"Let her talk."
"He survived."
"No, this way."
"It was important."
"Take my place."
"Who will know?"
"Yes, my son."
"I am an actress."
"They are different."
"Why this look?"
"Yes, once."
"Who were they?"
"Business is picking up."
"I'll be back tomorrow."
"Hey, calm down."
"I prefer to walk."
"Go ahead now."
"It looks like him."
"Listen, guys."
"Towards the north."
"Very good, indeed."
"They went out."
"He is fantastic."
"This is promising."
"You must stay."
"Go look elsewhere."
"I'm going to jump."
"You should stay."
"A small room?"
"Much better, thank you."
"That'll teach you."
"We have everything."
"This is my wife."
"He is waiting for us."
"Open the window."
"Can I taste?"
"Put on your shoes."
"Who is?"
"I liked it."
"Now go ahead."
"Do you want to start again?"
"She loved you."
"Not very far."
"Lucky break."
"The show begins."
"What about my money?"
"Who is there?"
"It's daytime."
"This is Bob."
"Do we have to?"
"Can you see?"
"Are you inviting me?"
"Better than you."
"But I will come back."
"Red or white?"
"You're finished."
"Straight to the point."
"She looks like you."
"Look at his eyes."
"I speak English."
"She is in love."
"Take a taxi."
"Here is my number."
"They are young."
"Are you cops?"
"But who is this?"
"They are pretty."
"There are some left."
"I don't play."
"She knew it."
"He has to go."
"Many times."
"On what basis?"
"I want it all."
"It was personal."
"Nothing like that."
"Under the bed."
"Really very good."
"One less."
"Are you leaving us?"
"Are you close?"
"They are awesome."
"I can pay."
"In a few hours."
"I'm having a blast."
"I will come back soon."
"This will be brief."
"It was huge."
"I will find him again."
"Are you new?"
"And you yourself?"
"I like him."
"Where does he live?"
"I am a dancer."
"What are you selling?"
"Yes, you know."
"Do you want to continue?"
"Do you want to live?"
"In my car."
"I miss them."
"Don't delay."
"Do you want to check?"
"Further left."
"What do you mean, 'we'?"
"It's tight."
"Yes, you should."
"I want to participate."
"And his parents?"
"Tell them what?"
"We were having fun."
"Not so simple."
"This is the key."
"Thanks to me."
"Don't move forward."
"It's Wednesday."
"You are charming."
"And mine."
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"Grass?"
"There were three of them."
"Get some fresh air."
"At my mother's."
"I will stay here."
"Hello, my friend."
"Do yourself a favor."
"End of transmission."
"Let's try something else."
"Will you be there?"
"I want to."
"Ready to go?"
"Let me see this."
"Last month."
"I have to check."
"That would be cool."
"A door slams."
"Have you booked?"
"What are we?"
"I'm watching him."
"Thank you, my little one."
"I'm going to eat."
"He wants it."
"It's fixed."
"Trust us."
"Goodbye, thank you."
"Of course, why?"
"I take everything."
"In the garage."
"Yes, one minute."
"I slept."
"Shh, shh, shh."
"Surname?"
"Can we begin?"
"I know myself."
"Let him in."
"I feel them."
"Is she there?"
"Count on us."
"And how are you?"
"It's said."
"Firing."
"Nobody is looking."
"It seems logical."
"Who's interested?"
"End of message."
"They call us."
"Here is one."
"I'm going to cum."
"Thank you, my angel."
"Make him talk."
"It makes you think."
"I am kind."
"Neither do they."
"No lizard."
"Right next door."
"I was curious."
"And the house?"
"That surprises me."
"Under cover."
"Go in peace."
"Not forever."
"Take a left."
"Everything is here."
"Come on, boys."
"Will it take long?"
"Choose one."
"No water."
"Where is Sara?"
"Nobody listens."
"Are you a virgin?"
"Watch your back."
"I'll try again."
"My little brother."
"I'm just asking."
"Let him come."
"Where does she live?"
"Yeah, let's go."
"Do you live together?"
"They are hungry."
"It's deserted."
"I am shy."
"We should talk."
"Goodbye, baby."
"You messed up."
"Do you take it?"
"Eat a little."
"Come on, let's move on."
"What about my stuff?"
"Let's take it slow."
"Like my mother."
"That'll teach him."
"So to speak."
"We do this."
"We're taking him on board."
"I am a photographer."
"On the left."
"We live together."
"We are together."
"Do you speak French?"
"Where do I sign?"
"Are you going to talk?"
"A little bit, yeah."
"I'll replace you."
"It was simple."
"Gradually."
"Hello, boys."
"But still."
"And the boy?"
"I would like to understand."
"I am nobody."
"Not even me."
"Here, look at this."
"She's screwed."
"Let's call the police."
"I'm betting everything."
"There are two of us."
"Come home with me."
"Anything but that."
"Fasten your seatbelt."
"It's hereditary."
"And my family?"
"Where is Nick?"
"Did you ring?"
"Where is Ray?"
"She is hungry."
"You're soaked."
"In a bar."
"I buy it."
"Just one."
"You are being watched."
"Lots of people."
"Suddenly."
"She wakes up."
"Let's start there."
"I admire him."
"It's symbolic."
"Did you understand?"
"Maybe never."
"If you only knew."
"In ten minutes."
"Wait your turn."
"Not bad at all."
"Here's your share."
"Now or never."
"Look a little."
"Show them to me."
"I am strong."
"Like all of you."
"My grandmother."
"Step back a little."
"Not a drop."
"Take a right."
"Meat."
"From my father."
"Where were you going?"
"Where is Bobby?"
"Let her do it."
"Farewell, my love."
"You're burning hot."
"He works here."
"A new life."
"Who has it?"
"Are you going to stay?"
"By the Gods."
"It's political."
"I'm going swimming."
"I'll bring it back."
"Pretty cool, huh?"
"I'm coming, Mom."
"Do you recognize this?"
"But where?"
"Me, me, me."
"At the library."
"Oh yes, yes."
"And those?"
"Good luck, sir."
"Let him breathe."
"You, come here."
"On your marks."
"Nobody understands."
"And in exchange?"
"Let's have fun."
"It was terrifying."
"I marry you."
"Exactly like that."
"Good, good, good."
"I live there."
"In broad daylight?"
"On the beach."
"Can we continue?"
"Something is coming."
"You mean?"
"I'm high."
"You're pretty."
"To the family."
"Who is who?"
"It's effective."
"I am a surgeon."
"She was fine."
"I'm good."
"His condition is getting worse."
"Tell me that again."
"I would be fine."
"On the right."
"Have you decided?"
"Everything is OK."
"I am proud."
"Let her pass."
"Not a penny."
"You can try."
"Smell that."
"I understand everything."
"One or two."
"It was fabulous."
"And dinner?"
"How many victims?"
"And your name?"
"Safe and sound."
"This is Will."
"I was pretending."
"They are arguing."
"They are perfect."
"It intrigues me."
"It really works."
"So, see you tomorrow."
"Have you checked?"
"A little gift."
"We will go together."
"In the forest."
"Heroin."
"Get in the car."
"Let's wait a bit."
"In Los Angeles."
"Which one?"
"Sure, come in."
"I held him."
"I will find you again."
"He was sick."
"No calls."
"Take the message."
"No one will come."
"It was us."
"Where is Will?"
"She is real."
"And what about?"
"Right behind you."
"That makes three."
"Don't apologize."
"He is shy."
"We'll call you."
"Thank you my love."
"I have them."
"What do we want?"
"You have to go home."
"Where is Billy?"
"I don't look."
"Look at his face."
"I was just asking."
"No, I'm coming."
"Come on, let's move."
"Go back home."
"Good night, doctor."
"He's pretending."
"Miami Police."
"We will call you back."
"And the kid?"
"We're in it."
"You're kind."
"And the mother?"
"Everything seems normal."
"Go ahead, open it."
"No, sit down."
"No injuries?"
"To your health."
"Tomorrow afternoon."
"Put on your coat."
"Dynamite."
"What about security?"
"We get used to it."
"It's scientific."
"You know who?"
"It is preferable."
"No, thank you very much."
"Why always me?"
"Did she call?"
"What do you decide?"
"In the fridge."
"Just to know."
"Hello, my brother."
"Next year."
"You are responsible."
"Open a channel."
"Not the police."
"Here is the situation."
"Why say that?"
"A true gentleman."
"We are surrounded."
"It wasn't necessary."
"No names."
"Not with him."
"No, stay there."
"I want mom."
"They loved it."
"What a nice surprise."
"Do you want to have lunch?"
"Lots of stuff."
"Do you want me?"
"Do you want to touch?"
"Further to the right."
"She is free."
"Not even true."
"The wheel turns."
"Tell us everything."
"Take a cigar."
"Say hello to him."
"Do you know what?"
"Do you know how to play?"
"We will have tried."
"Yes, this way."
"So say it."
"Live your life."
"All of them, without exception."
"It's sincere."
"Doctor's order."
"I am immortal."
"I want to come back."
"Yes, sweetie."
"Her name is?"
"You must know."
"It's imminent."
"No, thank God."
"In the shower."
"She is everywhere."
"Business is booming."
"Yeah, mate."
"Turn your head."
"For the baby."
"She is unique."
"Where is Eric?"
"A car arrives."
"She's finished."
"Not yours."
"You repeat yourself."
"She is delicious."
"Good night, then."
"Including you."
"And love?"
"It relaxes me."
"I threw up."
"Well, maybe."
"Find something else."
"You're going to laugh."
"You are finished."
"Look up."
"I'll wait outside."
"No, later."
"Wait two seconds."
"I see, yes."
"Are you looking for this?"
"Are you letting go of me?"
"They were."
"Watch out for yourself."
"And what then?"
"What were they doing?"
"She moved."
"Oh, I forgot."
"No one comes in."
"Where is who?"
"It's about time."
"I'm soaked."
"My sincere condolences."
"You're not answering?"
"I am an inspector."
"Him or me?"
"He can stay."
"Is this fair?"
"Where is Maggie?"
"It was exciting."
"I am touched."
"Turn on the TV."
"All my best wishes."
"It's final."
"Who wants to know?"
"She came."
"Hey, how are you?"
"Mom loves you."
"On the bridge."
"Do you know how?"
"Hi, darling."
"I tell him."
"You are fine."
"Don't you see?"
"God is great."
"Put it on me."
"One last drink?"
"Which one do you want?"
"You're a cop."
"Accused, stand up."
"For work."
"But listen to me."
"Right over there."
"Let's party."
"You can continue."
"At all costs."
"Oh, there she is."
"Do you know where?"
"I will talk to them."
"I answered."
"In any case."
"More than you."
"This is Amy."
"Oh, my baby."
"Is she here?"
"Here, drink this."
"Farewell, my friend."
"And your job?"
"Sorry for everything."
"Honor to the ladies."
"No, no way."
"He loved her."
"See you tomorrow then."
"Lower your voice."
"Take this one."
"In a second."
"But not her."
"If I want."
"Maybe nothing."
"It's historic."
"We can wait."
"It was grand."
"He is conscious."
"And as a drink?"
"An eye for an eye."
"What do we tell?"
"Is this you?"
"He was innocent."
"I wanted to know."
"He is blocked."
"They love each other."
"No sex."
"OK, that works."
"Another beer?"
"What about, then?"
"For this time."
"I'm available."
"And it continues."
"Keep watch."
"It relieves me."
"I moved."
"Hello, Mr. Phelps."
"I would really like to."
"In the mountains."
"For what occasion?"
"I am God."
"Here is the police."
"Yes, I understand."
"Think about that."
"We were together."
"When is she coming back?"
"Thank you, my heart."
"Why not him?"
"I'm done for."
"Yes, Your Highness."
"But be careful."
"Let's drink to that."
"I'm going to dance."
"She is tall."
"Thank you very much, madam."
"Oh, my darling."
"Go get ready."
"He was looking for you."
"I have sinned."
"He must know."
"Oh, you know."
"Lockable."
"Come on, it's okay."
"It was long."
"Follow your instinct."
"There are three of us."
"Do you want to have dinner?"
"Let's go somewhere."
"In the elevator."
"Maybe three."
"Do you speak German?"
"She was perfect."
"And the work?"
"He stops."
"One for you."
"They are amazing."
"I set you free."
"Here is the money."
"We are full."
"I was sincere."
"Are you Catholic?"
"Yes, but where?"
"Bring her to me."
"I have to go in."
"As you see."
"Don't push me."
"I keep them."
"In three days."
"You have to come back."
"Continue straight ahead."
"So, good night."
"Should I continue?"
"And here we are."
"Ask me what?"
"Is she serious?"
"It's exceptional."
"At the shopping center."
"He will get there."
"They won."
"Not so easy."
"Bring her here."
"Who's up for it?"
"I ate."
"Find something."
"Towards the south."
"See you later, man."
"Not his."
"That is the question."
"Take a room."
"I want to work."
"Not without me."
"Light."
"Oh really, why?"
"We hope so."
"Can I see?"
"Do you have anything better?"
"They call me."
"I see why."
"I travel a lot."
"He was married."
"I'm getting closer."
"We'll talk tomorrow."
"And this guy?"
"Are you hot?"
"Are you single?"
"Come on, take it."
"Do you come often?"
"And you, madam?"
"From me."
"He's still running."
"Are you looking at me?"
"And your mom?"
"Walk with me."
"You'll understand."
"Will I see you again?"
"I was waiting for it."
"Are you getting divorced?"
"I am real."
"All right, go on."
"I will continue."
"You never know."
"Let's find out."
"You said?"
"Are you going far?"
"We entered."
"I can check."
"Take off your coat."
"And before that?"
"Stay home."
"Are you taking it?"
"He does it."
"I want to watch."
"For two reasons."
"Look up there."
"I support you."
"Well done, guys."
"And the men?"
"No police."
"Where is Kyle?"
"Good luck, gentlemen."
"No jokes."
"When will it be?"
"I am a pilot."
"Look down."
"Let them in."
"From the inside."
"You know who."
"No need to shout."
"I'm walking."
"Let's go to your house."
"She won."
"We'll see tomorrow."
"You disappeared."
"Sorry for what?"
"I must be dreaming."
"Just a hunch."
"Like your mother."
"She is a doctor."
"It helps me."
"Ready for what?"
"Drink a little."
"All except one."
"I say no."
"Until the last one."
"And how so?"
"The bells are ringing."
"Who's going?"
"Love?"
"Yes, tonight."
"All this time."
"They say so."
"Not fast enough."
"For you, yes."
"Special Agent Gibbs."
"That's something else."
"Shall I wake you up?"
"You should answer."
"I am gifted."
"I have booked."
"We're cool."
"Are you watching me?"
"Keep trying."
"When do we eat?"
"Even so."
"Good night, son."
"Nice day, isn't it?"
"Watch over her."
"It's going to get cold."
"I am a detective."
"We remain calm."
"Yes, see you tomorrow."
"They adore you."
"I was serious."
"And here you are."
"How many years?"
"It's face."
"There you go, my dear."
"Right, honey?"
"What does that prove?"
"How many children?"
"But how to do it?"
"Can we start again?"
"Mr. Mayor."
"I want to come in."
"Nothing exceptional."
"Discuss what?"
"Not for a moment."
"I'm going down there."
"He forgot."
"From the visit."
"Have you smoked?"
"We were."
"And for him?"
"We're having a blast."
"Yes, I hope so."
"I am mean."
"All is forgiven."
"Come on, you two."
"It's classy."
"Not to us."
"We'll be back soon."
"I want to win."
"You were awesome."
"Nobody knew."
"And the little one?"
"Right, Dad?"
"I guarantee it."
"This is Ray."
"Ah, of course."
"Put that there."
"It was them."
"In the park."
"I'm going outside."
"I know it well."
"What would that change?"
"And the cops?"
"Watch me do it."
"Move on."
"They are watching us."
"It is clean."
"We got divorced."
"I'm hanging on."
"Do your homework."
"It's guaranteed."
"We have this."
"But look at this."
"And your children?"
"He is brilliant."
"No one in particular."
"They will be."
"It's inexplicable."
"Sure, yeah."
"Good people."
"Snow."
"It's a gift."
"As if by chance."
"Let's make peace."
"We are locked up."
"Look at it carefully."
"About?"
"Better than good."
"Wait for my orders."
"One more thing."
"Of course, boss."
"I'll bring her back."
"You'd better."
"No music."
"Largely."
"It's out of the question."
"I am young."
"Other than that."
"It's useful."
"Sorry for you."
"Thank you, young man."
"Think of me."
"Let's go get them."
"We look alike."
"Thank you very much, doctor."
"You were."
"Go ahead, kid."
"She doesn't answer."
"I'm resting."
"Stand guard."
"She is a virgin."
"Right in the middle."
"Yes, I love it."
"You are unique."
"Have you tried?"
"I was going there."
"Where else?"
"What shall we do?"
"Just a word."
"Take my car."
"He approaches."
"She was pretty."
"I'm awesome."
"I'm fucked."
"Always a pleasure."
"It will be done."
"Ten thousand dollars."
"I canceled."
"Not this week."
"It's special."
"In a month."
"I envy him."
"And your daughter?"
"She stays here."
"What was she doing?"
"You go ahead."
"Are you surprised?"
"Take off your glasses."
"Tell him that."
"How do we proceed?"
"Can I continue?"
"How am I?"
"Keep reading."
"For your safety."
"We will have it."
"Let them come in."
"They are hiding."
"Dad is right."
"Okay, that's fine."
"I concentrate."
"This is Eric."
"Need me?"
"We're withdrawing."
"Nineteen years old."
"A nice boy."
"In part, yes."
"Do you want to trade?"
"And your friend?"
"Are you getting married?"
"Are you coming with us?"
"I will find them."
"And your hand?"
"It stands up."
"Give the order."
"In a sense."
"In a way."
"We'll call you back."
"They are looking at us."
"Turn off the power."
"Just an idea."
"No, believe me."
"For a while now."
"And I understand."
"I am cured."
"We are free."
"Go tell him."
"No, tell me."
"Look at this picture."
"In two minutes."
"Okay, see you later."
"And you?"
"He was different."
"When the time comes."
"Your name, sir?"
"And the dog?"
"He slipped."
"I worked."
"Are you joining us?"
"Not this year."
"You're cooked."
"I'll be home soon."
"I totally understand."
"Let's raise our glasses."
"Three or four."
"I am engaged."
"Let's go see her."
"Pure and simple."
"I am diabetic."
"Not with this."
"How do they do it?"
"It's mathematical."
"I had been drinking."
"Great work."
"She started."
"Go ahead, son."
"A big smile."
"Ask your questions."
"He is white."
"Don't wait."
"Take a card."
"It's fresh."
"And in the meantime?"
"I shot."
"No, not for me."
"Aspirin."
"When will we arrive?"
"Should I open it?"
"Thank you, ma'am."
"Call someone."
"Where does that come from?"
"And the body?"
"Yes, this morning."
"Amen, my brother."
"Hold her tight."
"We'll make do."
"For the road."
"Not enough yet."
"Take my advice."
"And the photos?"
"I was happy."
"Who shouted?"
"You are surrounded."
"She survived."
"Pull down your pants."
"He is honest."
"Where is Gibbs?"
"It seems so."
"It must work."
"Yes, I want to."
"Find a solution."
"Play with me."
"I had to leave."
"It was unfair."
"Put on your jacket."
"Old-fashioned."
"It's soon."
"Good luck, man."
"I recognize her."
"With pleasure, sir."
"I bow."
"This is Carrie."
"Look for yourself."
"What are you studying?"
"Yes, over there."
"I want to learn."
"Good job."
"You are soaked."
"Let's do something."
"Match point."
"It's blue."
"I'll call her back."
"Not from here."
"Sure of what?"
"We were happy."
"Can we come?"
"The first time?"
"You are doing well."
"So what to do?"
"Late again."
"I will give it to him."
"Another round."
"Bring her up."
"Everything is organized."
"Like this one."
"Swear it to me."
"You are special."
"Place of birth?"
"We'll meet again."
"Pray for us."
"At the morgue."
"In the drawer."
"Yes, my friend."
"Call your mother."
"You must live."
"They are looking for us."
"Yes, my brother."
"Hey, come here."
"Can we go out?"
"I take it off."
"So, guys?"
"Our apologies."
"She has to go."
"Goodbye then."
"I authorize it."
"Get me out."
"We tried."
"You can watch."
"Let's give it a try."
"I listened."
"With my father."
"You are mean."
"Too many people."
"Here is the answer."
"Is this enough?"
"Are you a writer?"
"I don't sleep."
"We need to think."
"Sorry, friend."
"But it happens."
"Like a man."
"Yes, here it is."
"Even for you."
"Please sign here."
"Go with them."
"Let me come."
"This is the commander."
"And for us?"
"She adores me."
"No market."
"The other hand."
"He can wait."
"He is real."
"Did you come?"
"No point in resisting."
"Go quickly."
"Are you receiving us?"
"No more gas."
"Huh, guys?"
"I am captain."
"They understood."
"Healthy."
"I'll open the door for you."
"Call emergency services."
"Will you show me?"
"This is Jim."
"You will succeed."
"We are still looking."
"You can pass."
"Are you coming too?"
"I dream about it."
"Where will you be?"
"He started again."
"He looks at us."
"If it works."
"Why do you ask?"
"Sorry about what?"
"The whole family."
"Where is Joey?"
"Open the gate."
"He's looking for you."
"Let's do it like this."
"He jumped."
"Let's talk a little."
"Oh, never mind."
"Do you love him?"
"All in softness."
"I read a lot."
"All right, honey."
"I am homosexual."
"No point in arguing."
"Are you going?"
"Occasionally."
"Yeah, and you?"
"They are married."
"Thank you, uncle."
"Let me go up."
"What do you hear?"
"You can choose."
"Goodbye, Mother."
"I understand that."
"What does he know?"
"What do you mean, gone?"
"They are there."
"Be sure of it."
"Someone comes in."
"Don't say that."
"Give me that."
"It's everywhere."
"Hold your breath."
"She is still asleep."
"Take your chance."
"Welcome to paradise."
"Look at all this."
"And marriage?"
"Let's go to the bar."
"I have to study."
"One of us."
"No, keep it."
"Not much."
"On the boat."
"Stick out your tongue."
"I want to continue."
"I am everywhere."
"End of messages."
"You must sign."
"Look, I understand."
"Who is 'us'?"
"I will find her again."
"Let's make love."
"You will thank me."
"In the cellar."
"I know how to do it."
"About it."
"Do you understand it?"
"Everything is working out."
"I'll do with it."
"Just one night."
"Who will win?"
"For tonight."
"She was young."
"How does she do it?"
"Good night, honey."
"We survived."
"Everything is different."
"Let's wait and see."
"No luck."
"Of course, thank you."
"He is single."
"Goodbye, son."
"Since high school."
"Girl or boy?"
"I had heard."
"I was outside."
"No room."
"We meet again."
"Happy Valentine's Day."
"State your price."
"Let's go upstairs."
"Who is against?"
"A while."
"That you believe."
"It's red."
"Very good work."
"Very nice work."
"Do you want a divorce?"
"Go ahead, sir."
"Officer ashore."
"Not even you."
"I'm improving."
"Can I start?"
"Ah, I understand."
"I was protecting you."
"Here is our man."
"A beautiful woman."
"Save your strength."
"She was different."
"Watch the door."
"For later."
"Sheriff's Office."
"I'm counting on it."
"He will listen to you."
"He is human."
"Shall we tell him?"
"And the water?"
"They are excellent."
"Keep working."
"When do you start?"
"I will call him back."
"All right, man."
"Good work."
"Pretty cool, right?"
"We are adults."
"I know, man."
"Where is Rick?"
"This is your room."
"She was nice."
"Almost a year."
"She was there."
"She ignores him."
"It escapes me."
"I already know."
"She is going to give birth."
"And for her?"
"Oh, you think so?"
"Where is Scylla?"
"Of course, Mom."
"I am optimistic."
"She grew up."
"You can feel it."
"You're an early riser."
"The end is near."
"Afterwards, we'll see."
"As always, right?"
"I must continue."
"What do I know?"
"And the boys?"
"Your name again?"
"Soup?"
"Let's take a picture."
"We're leaving now."
"This one too."
"Who is asking me?"
"She is mean."
"Any other ideas?"
"I'm trembling."
"It's wet."
"I'm watching her."
"Not both."
"Why this name?"
"Right, darling?"
"A last wish?"
"What were you waiting for?"
"You'll like it."
"And for good reason."
"No, I work."
"Just imagine."
"Outside."
"You will see it."
"It was hilarious."
"But how so?"
"Do you want to order?"
"I'm going up front."
"Do your best."
"Pick up the phone."
"I'm walking around."
"Are you arguing?"
"He lives here."
"He is still asleep."
"Sorry, my friend."
"I will do that."
"We loved each other."
"There you go, very good."
"She deserves better."
"Are you covering for me?"
"Thank you, friends."
"For a year."
"Nothing concrete."
"No details."
"What were you hoping for?"
"Not for a long time."
"What was she saying?"
"She works here."
"Oh, there you are."
"For his own good."
"She is clever."
"This is Hank."
"He was perfect."
"Are you English?"
"No, let's go."
"And your leg?"
"Take a message."
"A very small one."
"Which one do you prefer?"
"Do you know how to dance?"
"At the right time."
"We're outside."
"It's rough."
"For what, then?"
"Who am I?"
"Good luck, then."
"It's Monday."
"I am a musician."
"Turn on the light."
"Your turn will come."
"Do you want to come?"
"Have a beer."
"He is watching us."
"Good news?"
"Change the disc."
"For us too."
"Look at the date."
"Put them there."
"She can't."
"Would that suit you?"
"I hope so too."
"He is telling the truth."
"Don't listen."
"Leave it there."
"It happens to him."
"You stay."
"It could happen."
"Where is Jim?"
"We are happy."
"I will pass it on to him."
"No dial tone."
"Come, my son."
"What do they have?"
"Go ahead, eat."
"In the box."
"Do it quickly."
"It's Italian."
"I'm exhausted."
"Stay a while."
"A nice girl."
"I am normal."
"Now that's enough."
"Not before tomorrow."
"How many days?"
"Where is Julia?"
"He adored her."
"The doctor arrives."
"The last time."
"Of course, come in."
"We think so."
"I'm decided."
"I will go tomorrow."
"They are human."
"I can fly."
"And you."
"We were young."
"On the bed."
"Let's take a tour."
"I deserved it."
"Turn off the engine."
"You can answer."
"She is terrified."
"You have arrived."
"Yeah, we'll see."
"Oh, you're welcome."
"Look at my face."
"Are we coming soon?"
"I am healed."
"You should eat."
"Pray for him."
"They are together."
"He's waiting outside."
"Let's start with that."
"In this house."
"And the husband?"
"I can iron."
"No light."
"No cops."
"They separate."
"Your phone rings."
"She was happy."
"This is my father."
"Like mine."
"One on one."
"I hear everything."
"Do we say that?"
"I call her back."
"Let's make a baby."
"Let's make a pact."
"I must act."
"It's God."
"It's sublime."
"To all of you."
"Praise be to Buddha."
"To others."
"In the eyes."
"Half a million."
"This is Maggie."
"You were friends?"
"Very good, perfect."
"I was free."
"Let's do it together."
"Are you in?"
"We saw."
"Where is Bob?"
"One, two, three."
"This is my husband."
"In the hall."
"Do you speak Spanish?"
"From my mother."
"Right or left?"
"They are happy."
"I know, baby."
"And your sister?"
"A normal life."
"Wait a minute."
"This is Barry."
"I collect them."
"Are you going to work?"
"Who are you asking?"
"And with whom?"
"Here is the key."
"On the stomach."
"And be careful."
"We were there."
"He's talking to me."
"Talked about what?"
"I did."
"Can you open?"
"Don't do it."
"Are you sleeping together?"
"Are you training?"
"I wish so."
"Can you imagine that?"
"You are an adult."
"Try it a little."
"Everything is important."
"Go back and sit down."
"And my daughter?"
"She was gone."
"Come back and see me."
"In the courtyard."
"She has it."
"Look at my eyes."
"Does that come back to you?"
"It's getting serious."
"Finish your drink."
"Go around back."
"Yes, yes, yes."
"He was awesome."
"She is stuck."
"Two, actually."
"Can you be more specific?"
"A storm is approaching."
"Open the iris."
"We'll fix that."
"She was awesome."
"They will love it."
"No prisoners."
"Oh, sweetie."
"She's looking for you."
"For my father."
"It's paid."
"You are in love."
"It's secure."
"Go ask him."
"Not from you."
"Let's go find him."
"Yes, it happens."
"We were right."
"That would make sense."
"Take this money."
"I can continue."
"When is it coming?"
"You love each other."
"Two against one."
"Teamwork."
"You will be fine."
"Take my card."
"I had to come."
"It's vital."
"He was nice."
"You are forgiven."
"Mom is right."
"I was stuck."
"Never seen that."
"Where is Elena?"
"Park there."
"It's healthy."
"Make love."
"Thank you, children."
"Unlike you."
"I'm going to resign."
"I know it."
"The children are sleeping."
"Go ahead, answer."
"Where do we start?"
"Hello, my little one."
"Good evening, boys."
"Did you feel it?"
"Where is Hank?"
"I'll guess."
"In that order."
"Mom is fine."
"We are silent."
"We can begin."
"He's having fun."
"But not that."
"Bring it to me."
"You were great."
"It works too."
"And our agreement?"
"You're sexy."
"You have to get out."
"This story again?"
"I'll find some."
"I feel you."
"Better than what?"
"You must come."
"How do we get out?"
"For all that."
"In what field?"
"You were gone."
"You are repeating yourself."
"It is off."
"I wake up."
"No, before that."
"He follows us."
"You're welcome, sir."
"It's powerful."
"No sermon."
"You, maybe."
"Can you breathe?"
"Based on what?"
"Take over."
"But for what?"
"She's pretending."
"Anyone know."
"Two more minutes."
"And for whom?"
"Let's take a taxi."
"This is Olivia."
"She is brilliant."
"No argument."
"And even more."
"Thank you, my son."
"Go straight ahead."
"He's a cop."
"Do you think so too?"
"Calm down, kid."
"How to say this?"
"You can go down."
"Right at the top."
"He is extraordinary."
"It's professional."
"Everything was perfect."
"Yeah, see you later."
"Look behind you."
"She is heavy."
"I am retired."
"Where?"
"And your girlfriend?"
"What a lovely name."
"I'm fair."
"Keep playing."
"Two or three."
"It's all over."
"Yes, I believe so."
"Welcome, my brother."
"For my birthday."
"It's started."
"It's harmless."
"In this room."
"We'll talk again."
"Here, for you."
"In the pocket."
"Thank you, my boy."
"He's tough."
"Make him come."
"To all of us."
"Oh, my boy."
"I always win."
"What do I wear?"
"She is waiting for us."
"We'll join you."
"But it works."
"So, this trip?"
"Unlike us."
"You'll laugh."
"They like it."
"You are superb."
"We are called."
"Around what time?"
"It's trendy."
"More tea?"
"Sorry, what were you saying?"
"She insisted."
"I can take it."
"Let's say yes."
"Sorry about yesterday."
"He is American."
"And business?"
"The usual stuff."
"In your office."
"She looks at us."
"We worked together."
"It will be better."
"Look at the road."
"Everything is the same."
"Just a coffee."
"Gasoline."
"Do something."
"Have you seen?"
"Everything is beautiful."
"Until tomorrow."
"I am a medium."
"Tell me again."
"On the back."
"It was brave."
"I challenge you."
"Open a frequency."
"I do this."
"Don't drink."
"No one passes."
"Another part?"
"Just a drop."
"This can wait."
"Underwater."
"It's unreal."
"Are we doing business?"
"No need to insist."
"A good time."
"They were arguing."
"A good point."
"You are extraordinary."
"Do you have this?"
"Any side effects?"
"Shall we go out?"
"You should sleep."
"They will be there."
"Yes, but what?"
"Take up your weapons."
"Sorry, guys."
"None of them."
"A quick question."
"The basement."
"End of line."
"He is French."
"We share everything."
"Driving license."
"We'll discuss it."
"Find a way."
"He is sensitive."
"A real miracle."
"Not there."
"I'm a widow."
"Secure the perimeter."
"Want to check?"
"A real beauty."
"Exactly like you."
"A little what?"
"The other day."
"You smell good."
"I am reassured."
"On both sides."
"On the plane."
"What type?"
"And thank you again."
"We're watching you."
"I have to ask."
"In his car."
"Is this understood?"
"I will have them."
"Good for you."
"You guys are awesome."
"I'm trying again."
"How will you do it?"
"Let him finish."
"And look at yourself."
"We have to go in."
"So, let it go."
"We will be."
"And now this."
"I say yes."
"On the ground."
"How many more?"
"Do you want to try again?"
"Maybe what?"
"I had to act."
"Mom and Dad."
"Search the house."
"In my bed."
"After lunch."
"After all that?"
"I was against it."
"Do you want to go up?"
"He has everything."
"It's rigged."
"Are you forgetting anything?"
"A better idea?"
"She wants a divorce."
"Did you know them?"
"The baby is sleeping."
"It was Dad."
"Do you want to go down?"
"You can dream."
"And since when?"
"My stepfather."
"He asks you."
"Very well, doctor."
"Can we go up?"
"You guessed it."
"Here's my plan."
"No coffee."
"Take a shower."
"What do they know?"
"But why now?"
"Go hide."
"Goodbye, honey."
"I hire you."
"Powder."
"Where is Victor?"
"This is Katie."
"What are you preparing?"
"Where is Tyler?"
"Who employs you?"
"It's exquisite."
"I am amazed."
"How many months?"
"Where would I go?"
"I take it back."
"We're keeping it."
"Really, it's okay."
"She passed."
"You dreamed."
"He had been drinking."
"He is diabetic."
"I'm going to finish."
"Found something?"
"It was better."
"I had some."
"It is true."
"No drugs."
"The bell rang."
"Is this normal?"
"Keep your fingers crossed."
"Oh, sweet Jesus."
"She loved it."
"It was intentional."
"Come here, little one."
"I was married."
"Are you correct?"
"Point blank."
"Are you sleeping here?"
"It's done."
"Something important."
"Are you in love?"
"Are you a police officer?"
"He's doing it again."
"We have to wait."
"And this morning?"
"Left or right?"
"Are you staying for dinner?"
"He is careful."
"Even for me."
"Why not her?"
"It's proven."
"Come, come, come."
"God protect you."
"Me too, Mom."
"Where would you go?"
"One for me."
"I assured."
"Thanks, I know."
"Go left."
"Thank you for the compliment."
"It was quick."
"He was magnificent."
"Very good, Mom."
"There are four of them."
"How are we doing?"
"We see it."
"And say what?"
"She is taken."
"You're adorable."
"It's a matter of time."
"No, you think so?"
"For two years."
"Romeo and Juliet."
"An old habit."
"On your left."
"When will you come back?"
"No, excuse me."
"Not for her."
"You left."
"Good luck, son."
"For several reasons."
"I'm still hesitating."
"In the same place."
"That's generous."
"They are smart."
"Take off your hat."
"How many rooms?"
"My ex-husband."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Morphine."
"In which branch?"
"Others will come."
"Catch your breath."
"Nobody knows."
"Where is Lana?"
"And him, then?"
"Oh really?"
"Vote for me."
"How dare they?"
"But that's enough."
"I screamed."
"It is solid."
"Where were they?"
"Empty your bag."
"Battle stations."
"I want to eat."
"I will follow you."
"Good evening, guys."
"I'm going to sing."
"Look at the time."
"A lucky charm."
"And sex?"
"She doesn't want to."
"Can we move forward?"
"He accepted."
"How can I explain it to you?"
"He speaks English."
"She was cute."
"I am confident."
"It will be you."
"At the bank."
"We start tomorrow."
"A little coffee?"
"The big day."
"Literally."
"He is unique."
"At any time."
"They know me."
"He was happy."
"Each of them."
"Now we wait."
"Try it anyway."
"Would that be possible?"
"I'm looking for her."
"Every minute counts."
"I'll wait for him."
"You are human."
"Like a family."
"I'll be home early."
"This is Don."
"I'm warning him."
"What a lovely surprise."
"OK thanks."
"Open sesame."
"For a moment."
"Look at her carefully."
"Goodbye, Professor."
"And I appreciate it."
"I will investigate."
"Drink your coffee."
"Take off your mask."
"You work late."
"It's high."
"You are radiant."
"Is he coming here?"
"So listen to me."
"In time."
"Hey, wake up."
"It is open."
"Not a cat."
"She is clean."
"He stopped."
"Go faster."
"They called?"
"It's unintentional."
"She was terrified."
"I can't hold on anymore."
"Very well said."
"It pays well."
"Cocaine."
"In some ways."
"Listen a little."
"What does she know?"
"Welcome to Earth."
"No witness."
"You understand, right?"
"Tell me how."
"I am a model."
"I would do it again."
"Starting tomorrow morning."
"I picked up."
"Who is right?"
"Yeah, it works."
"Good idea, right?"
"Compared to what?"
"Under the table."
"For my son."
"Yes, right here."
"It was clear."
"Are you defending him?"
"Good friends."
"At the beach."
"We'll go tomorrow."
"Now it's your turn."
"A safe place."
"Poetry."
"She's going to leave."
"You could have."
"How do we get in?"
"He has to pay."
"In the dark."
"You're taken."
"On the terrace."
"I am a waitress."
"Phone for you."
"It's legitimate."
"No, left."
"No, but thank you."
"Let me breathe."
"Are you an actress?"
"Sure, man."
"Sorry, girls."
"This is my mother."
"Where does it lead?"
"She loved him."
"Just a friend."
"Do you hear each other?"
"Are you still asleep?"
"I relax."
"At dawn."
"Use your head."
"Who is calling me?"
"They are looking for me."
"I'm taking care of it."
"Tea, thank you."
"What are they waiting for?"
"I'm Chuck."
"Call security."
"Or what else?"
"Oh, go ahead."
"She looks like me."
"To both of you."
"I like everything."
"I want to change."
"And by far."
"We heard."
"No women."
"Hey, old man."
"The American Dream."
"Where is Doug?"
"I'm shutting up."
"That very one."
"She's telling the truth."
"This is James."
"To my mother."
"Not a lot."
"This is my daughter."
"When does it start?"
"We can share."
"Oh, good, good."
"He is untouchable."
"Take the helm."
"With pleasure, thank you."
"And it starts again."
"You're nice."
"This is crucial."
"He ignores it."
"This is Dan."
"Two by two."
"I like to dance."
"It was unintentional."
"We know what?"
"You are fast."
"Come to your senses."
"Let's go, gentlemen."
"And there?"
"Twenty-one."
"Where is Nathan?"
"Orange juice?"
"End of quote."
"No, just like that."
"To both of us."
"Left, right, left."
"I'm replacing her."
"For my mother."
"You survived."
"Just one more second."
"No further."
"Send it to me."
"So, does it work?"
"They have everything."
"Okay, sure."
"I am French."
"I want to call."
"Just the two of you?"
"And the match?"
"What do you like?"
"And what's next?"
"What did it say?"
"A small accident."
"Have you thought about it?"
"Yes, very beautiful."
"Yes, maybe."
"I know how to listen."
"We welcome you."
"What would you say?"
"Where is Julie?"
"I defend myself."
"It's ingenious."
"You're on your own."
"Not since yesterday."
"Glad for you."
"Let us work."
"Good times."
"I'm going to tidy up."
"Tell me about it."
"Can you answer?"
"I was out."
"Yes, very good."
"And the phone?"
"Are you a pilot?"
"And to me."
"Pack your suitcase."
"Let me work."
"For the home."
"I'm keeping this."
"How do you want?"
"Yes, later."
"I am reasonable."
"For a few days."
"More than good."
"Ah, here they are."
"You're mixing everything up."
"The sun is shining."
"How much was it?"
"Could it be possible?"
"Oh, my love."
"Good God, no."
"No one important."
"Hey, wait a minute."
"And your car?"
"And last night?"
"We'll see later."
"Just five minutes."
"And our market?"
"No tears."
"Or something."
"No, not always."
"I was high."
"I am Flash."
"They were here."
"Sauce?"
"Don't listen to them."
"Where is Amy?"
"I am an accountant."
"Now let's go."
"They are huge."
"And his name?"
"She goes there."
"And this man?"
"Do you really believe that?"
"You have started."
"You started."
"Yes, my admiral."
"It's psychological."
"They don't know."
"Let's start with you."
"The time is approaching."
"I know where."
"I'm just arriving."
"With time."
"She adores you."
"And the food?"
"Is this allowed?"
"Let's take stock."
"Might as well make the most of it."
"Say your name."
"Where is Beth?"
"They will find us."
"Mom was right."
"I'll improvise."
"I am Lily."
"Very well done."
"It's defensible."
"It was borderline."
"Is it edible?"
"So, what now?"
"She is mute."
"Do you want to listen?"
"Eyes closed."
"It depresses me."
"Lower your hand."
"More money."
"Do you want to chat?"
"Let's do it now."
"I would like to try."
"I'll explain to him."
"Here, read this."
"Will you wait for me?"
"Pass them to me."
"Yes, for you."
"My little sister."
"On the hill."
"Yes, my queen."
"No alliance."
"I am tall."
"We'll think about it."
"Under my nose."
"Your favorite dish."
"More than me."
"My dear friend."
"Just to see."
"Come, follow me."
"Wait for my call."
"No, my dear."
"She is a journalist."
"You could try."
"I'm going to move."
"I'll fuck you."
"Dad was right."
"Go ahead, drink."
"Hello, my friends."
"You were beautiful."
"It's normal."
"We hear you."
"Is he working?"
"You see there?"
"That one too."
"Think about yourself."
"You are rich."
"Request for reinforcements."
"Yes, much better."
"Take notes."
"Here, my friend."
"Just for you."
"It's light."
"Do you know how to swim?"
"I'm still looking."
"Good night, Benjamin."
"He looks like him."
"And from whom?"
"How to find it?"
"It's close."
"Let her come in."
"You're handsome."
"He looks at me."
"This is Sally."
"Send someone."
"Get yourself treated."
"It's cool."
"Do you care?"
"Look, guys."
"I knew."
"You've changed."
"There, it's fine."
"Go for a walk."
"Day after day."
"For your birthday."
"I'll bring it."
"The whole world."
"He was looking at me."
"Your Royal Highness."
"Are you going to sing?"
"Since I was little."
"You understand quickly."
"Let her breathe."
"He remembers."
"We have to go back."
"I understand, yes."
"To what end?"
"He is mute."
"Accidents happen."
"I'm looking for you."
"Sounds interesting."
"I'm going to close."
"We will see about that."
"I prefer to wait."
"They are busy."
"Where is Buffy?"
"Just across the street."
"About a week."
"They are strong."
"This is the reason."
"You wait here."
"Where is Molly?"
"You have me."
"For a girl."
"Santa Claus."
"Especially at night."
"Easy, big guy."
"Take a vacation."
"She is sublime."
"Hi, how are you?"
"I'll take note."
"We were arguing."
"Of all that."
"A little late."
"Look at the map."
"I drank."
"Where is Mary?"
"He calls me."
"How to explain it?"
"I am a reporter."
"I hesitated."
"You're heavy."
"I'm straight."
"Make an appointment."
"I will call them."
"This is Helen."
"Where is Lily?"
"You are perceptive."
"They love me."
"You know, you?"
"So, let's get to work."
"To life."
"The train is arriving."
"They started."
"She does it."
"To new friends."
"Here is my plan."
"How to prove it?"
"It is important."
"Turn down the volume."
"Well done everyone."
"My grandson."
"Go ahead, send it."
"It's solid."
"Stay in touch."
"One last chance."
"Ah, you see?"
"Mr. Minister."
"She will be delighted."
"He was cute."
"Watch over him."
"I will say it."
"In this outfit?"
"Family reunion."
"The meter is running."
"I want to drive."
"I was a volunteer."
"That makes four."
"Are you talking to him?"
"No, my heart."
"Dad is gone."
"Who's getting married?"
"Very good, great."
"Behind the door."
"Another thing."
"I protect her."
"She is hiding."
"I am Sofia."
"I'll bring him back."
"Go shopping."
"I'm nice."
"Yes, see you soon."
"Big day tomorrow."
"Hold the position."
"Change the subject."
"Thank you, see you soon."
"So, how was your day?"
"Yes, received."
"Hello, my boy."
"Let her come."
"Who pays you?"
"In life."
"Too much work."
"It's fun."
"I have to see."
"Here is the number."
"You were fine."
"He is Italian."
"Keep searching."
"And tomorrow night?"
"See you tomorrow evening."
"Hold the steering wheel."
"Yes, both."
"You and you."
"Do you know how to cook?"
"How can I explain this?"
"To the west."
"I vote for."
"Do you know any?"
"Nobody comes."
"Where is it going?"
"Where is Rose?"
"And the third?"
"Dad is fine."
"I'm holding them back."
"And where to go?"
"What's he doing?"
"I'll take them."
"Come join us."
"You're cool."
"You are punished."
"Hold your positions."
"In the past."
"Take my arm."
"White wine."
"I'm going ahead."
"Closing the doors."
"Take responsibility."
"Where is Chuck?"
"He protected me."
"I had to try."
"Hello my brother."
"Where is Megan?"
"What will change?"
"Unlike me."
"Yes, good night."
"What do you mean, what?"
"Guys, look."
"Are you doing it again?"
"I was looking for her."
"A good friend."
"Okay baby."
"She is getting ready."
"It's worth celebrating."
"You can go up."
"With my mother."
"Are you helping us?"
"This is Karen."
"And for that?"
"Yes, thank God."
"Identity card?"
"Where is Elizabeth?"
"Raise the shields."
"Answer the phone."
"Can I try?"
"No correspondence."
"Where is Abby?"
"On TV."
"Can I read?"
"In this weather?"
"It looks great."
"Can we watch?"
"Can I listen?"
"I know how to count."
"Dry your tears."
"Very well, Captain."
"Where do they live?"
"Everything is written."
"Hello, you two."
"In this neighborhood?"
"Do I look like him?"
"Yeah, right there."
"Where is Quinn?"
"They were waiting for us."
"Yes, we will see."
"She's still breathing."
"How are you, sir?"
"In my dreams."
"Wait a little."
"Do you see it?"
"Who knows why."
"Towards the west."
"But yes, let's see."
"You would like to."
"Who wants what?"
"Wait for the rest."
"I improvised."
"With a girl."
"Where is Jesse?"
"God is good."
"Yes, basically."
"She is a nurse."
"And over there?"
"Where is Karen?"
"Clean this up for me."
"It's sensational."
"Bend your knees."
"Nothing specific."
"In your seats."
"In the library."
"He apologizes."
"Are you eating well?"
"No thank you, sir."
"Where is Carol?"
"Where is Nina?"
"You are magnificent."
"I was looking for him."
"Now, get to work."
"Well done, my boy."
"That seems reasonable."
"It's there."
"There and there."
"You have to deal with it."
"Take the keys."
"A young woman."
"I serve you."
"Let's go, honey."
"Does mom know?"
"Walk a little."
"Just that one."
"Play something."
"Where were they going?"
"Not a chance."
"Go to the bathroom."
"From all over the world."
"Block the exits."
"We will leave tomorrow."
"It's cozy."
"Take the baby."
"This is Robin."
"I am disarmed."
"For a very long time."
"She's in it."
"A human being."
"I am lucky."
"I'm not saying anything."
"Are you a nurse?"
"I am a firefighter."
"We're coming from there."
"Shall we talk about it?"
"Yes, twice."
"Let me summarize."
"I would tell him."
"Let's take a look."
"The first day."
"From the part?"
"Tell us what?"
"I work late."
"These are the facts."
"You have to back off."
"It got out of hand."
"At a friend's house."
"I'm working tomorrow."
"Here is the list."
"We are working on it."
"Where is Stefan?"
"We will know."
"We can win."
"This is Kyle."
"Gather your things."
"She is getting married."
"Car theft."
"Your favorite color?"
"This is Bobby."
"Last summer."
"Yes, one day."
"Towards the east."
"Here are the facts."
"It's precious."
"It was here."
"Keep them closed."
"Do you want to?"
"I could try."
"Are you a believer?"
"Not the other way around."
"Well, good."
"Cream?"
"This is Jeff."
"For my wife."
"For hours."
"Don't swear."
"Nothing surprising."
"Get on top of it."
"Give it a try."
"I know how to drive."
"I am clean."
"Hey, over here."
"Another coffee?"
"We believe it."
"Come join me."
"Mr. and Mrs."
"Can you wait?"
"I am absent."
"Make me laugh."
"They are stuck."
"Fill out this form."
"Listen to your mother."
"Come back to earth."
"It's stable."
"Show me what?"
"Go join them."
"Will you tell him?"
"Pray for me."
"Not those."
"Yes, I knew."
"I wanted to leave."
"What to do then?"
"Go your own way."
"About a month."
"Okay, I understand."
"On what occasion?"
"Watch out, guys."
"Oh, forgive me."
"Go all out."
"When is it?"
"I am sexy."
"They are friends."
"She is nowhere to be found."
"Wait, listen to me."
"Let me listen."
"Look at these pictures."
"On the head."
"I park."
"God bless him."
"Two out of three."
"What about my car?"
"She is a minor."
"I'll come back tomorrow."
"Are you engaged?"
"Where is Sophie?"
"I would like it."
"I like to cook."
"For all of you."
"About two hours."
"Let's keep moving forward."
"Always late."
"Everything is connected."
"Drum roll."
"I started."
"It's anonymous."
"It's back."
"My dear boy."
"Yes, we should."
"Let's have a coffee."
"In nature."
"Do you want to visit?"
"It's unique."
"My little darling."
"He's going to call."
"Not ours."
"And you, Dad?"
"From Los Angeles."
"But he does."
"In the barn."
"Under what circumstances?"
"For a week."
"Stay put."
"I have to eat."
"Good luck, kid."
"No, you stay."
"Wedding gift."
"I am focused."
"A real tough guy."
"I am a psychologist."
"Where is Ann?"
"Where is Angel?"
"Am I disturbing you?"
"I'll come by tomorrow."
"No beer."
"In the jungle."
"I spoke."
"How can I believe you?"
"Who is behind?"
"I can start again."
"I'm Ben."
"At the very back."
"I am moved."
"Mr. Director."
"Yes, uncle."
"Tell him everything."
"That will have to wait."
"I am handsome."
"About two weeks."
"It surprises me."
"She was hot."
"I will keep my word."
"Am I pretty?"
"Or the other way around."
"Ready, guys?"
"Right in the head."
"Can we know?"
"When are you leaving again?"
"In my own way."
"You should go out."
"Here, go ahead."
"He is brave."
"Here you go, guys."
"Of course, baby."
"But I know."
"I wasn't sleeping."
"He always comes back."
"We will be together."
"Except one thing."
"He looks at you."
"And the boat?"
"You are engaged."
"Far from you."
"Can we taste?"
"That would be fun."
"Do you trust?"
"But no, Mom."
"I'm leaving too."
"And by whom?"
"Sounds like fun."
"Welcome to Hollywood."
"It's authentic."
"He should have."
"Everything is cool."
"They work together."
"Here is the file."
"Where is Vic?"
"He must."
"The party begins."
"Except once."
"Just a moment longer."
"Like magic."
"You are you."
"We are colleagues."
"No, not me."
"Did she speak?"
"She jumped."
"Are you going to accept?"
"Ten percent."
"It was closed."
"Ready for takeoff."
"Hey, kids."
"It's intimate."
"This is ideal."
"They accepted."
"Tell me where."
"A lot of work."
"Near here?"
"A huge thing."
"A breakfast?"
"Go find her."
"Smell this."
"More of what?"
"When do you finish?"
"Where was he going?"
"I like to read."
"I understand myself."
"Not by choice."
"Can we eat?"
"Confidence reigns."
"We're going to close."
"She understands me."
"Clear the area."
"The one in the middle."
"Are you a student?"
"Goodbye, Will."
"Happy birthday, Dad."
"Choose a card."
"You hesitated."
"His best friend."
"It is imperative."
"Better than me."
"You should too."
"I enjoyed it."
"I am a student."
"I am English."
"Can I participate?"
"Yes, my child."
"Let's talk about this."
"She must know."
"About six months."
"Not in public."
"Good day, madam."
"He's looking for it."
"We do it."
"Okay, calm down."
"And the second?"
"It's all in there."
"Is it allowed?"
"Can I have it?"
"I am interested."
"Only three more."
"I was fine."
"For the most part."
"And my friends?"
"Can I answer?"
"Thank you, Grandpa."
"They are close."
"Here's our guy."
"Just one question."
"He is powerful."
"Who came?"
"This is Howard."
"What, darling?"
"Goodbye, Captain."
"No need to continue."
"We'll watch."
"Where is Angela?"
"He has them."
"What are we watching?"
"A true hero."
"Hey, big guy."
"So, the job?"
"I'll let you know."
"All right."
"On my life."
"I'll pass."
"You could come."
"Here's your man."
"Say your prayers."
"New Orleans."
"I can work."
"And the fingerprints?"
"Show must go on."
"You wanted to know."
"Wait for instructions."
"They were close."
"Is that your business?"
"But why?"
"Here's yours."
"Yes, himself."
"Keep watching."
"We are calm."
"Hello, Grandpa."
"He went down."
"Keep your promise."
"For my brother."
"And the doctor?"
"Every second counts."
"What a nice place."
"Have faith."
"But better."
"It belongs to you."
"We have to go down."
"You will stay here."
"Here are the rules."
"She is single."
"He's cute."
"To apologize."
"Entry code."
"Let's start from the beginning."
"Prove it to me."
"Yesterday afternoon."
"But by whom?"
"As little as possible."
"I know what?"
"Get that out of my way."
"What do you sell?"
"Well, good evening."
"Honeymoon?"
"Shall I tell you?"
"Don't push it."
"They are brothers."
"Let's keep looking."
"You're hot."
"A little souvenir."
"Yes, my boy."
"Give me some."
"And your friends?"
"Okay, girls."
"Of course, doctor."
"They are wonderful."
"I am expected."
"I'm going out tomorrow."
"Did you stop?"
"Yes, several times."
"This is Allison."
"Thank you, my sister."
"Thank you, sister."
"Eternal life."
"They are having fun."
"Can't you hear?"
"For a month."
"He is splendid."
"Comfortable?"
"It amuses me."
"This is Angela."
"Hey, little guy."
"In the bathtub."
"ID?"
"Excuse me, Captain."
"Shut your mouth."
"Not in our house."
"I have traveled."
"Keep the pressure on."
"Did he eat?"
"He was gifted."
"Good heavens, no."
"He will call you back."
"My brother-in-law."
"I talk to him."
"They are fast."
"She confessed."
"It's behind."
"You're a good kisser."
"I dreamed about it."
"Good morning, Mr. Draper."
"You are fabulous."
"Come on, move over."
"You asked."
"Where is Jeff?"
"I had to ask."
"Can we come by?"
"He will have it."
"Who is in it?"
"Can it be cured?"
"This is Chuck."
"Put it here."
"It looks like you."
"Shall we go back?"
"From very far away."
"Think for a second."
"Take this too."
"Almost two years."
"To see what?"
"No map."
"Is it me?"
"You'll never guess."
"And much more."
"No work."
"He loved it."
"More than enough."
"You will find it good."
"Change the channel."
"He's high."
"Who rang?"
"You play well."
"Not this morning."
"It's getting complicated."
"Only one more."
"It was free."
"That would be fantastic."
"You shut up."
"So, see you soon."
"In the front row."
"Do you want to start?"
"Your time will come."
"Let them wait."
"He's choking."
"No mail."
"All four of them."
"I had to know."
"Come say hello."
"Take your bag."
"This is Doug."
"She is solid."
"Which one are you?"
"It's premature."
"It's gone."
"He was a doctor."
"Ask him what?"
"Galactica, this is Apollo."
"Yet another one."
"What are you listening to?"
"I would be."
"Yes, I accept."
"Like a dog."
"She knows me."
"Many others."
"Is this reasonable?"
"She is engaged."
"I'm covered."
"Take your jacket."
"It will be fine here."
"And the war?"
"Go get some."
"Put two of them."
"Yes, let's do that."
"Especially for you."
"No, I love it."
"In this direction."
"Want to watch?"
"To friendship."
"Another man?"
"He is Jewish."
"They ran away."
"I am beautiful."
"I'll make a note of it."
"At your ease."
"Close this door."
"Well, I think."
"Where is Monica?"
"That seems fair."
"At university."
"What would it be?"
"They are fantastic."
"In the van."
"Let me go, man."
"I am a painter."
"She was great."
"This is Charlotte."
"Of life."
"Whose?"
"And his daughter?"
"You are a lawyer."
"As it should be."
"Will you call me back?"
"Return to camp."
"Take a bath."
"They are closed."
"I was saying to myself."
"Do you work together?"
"Who is here?"
"Or a woman."
"We must leave."
"Bring it down."
"I would say yes."
"Thank you, my child."
"This is Abby."
"We are in love."
"We came back."
"Keep the faith."
"Take the day off."
"Right in front of me."
"Don't bother."
"Pray with me."
"Do you want to give up?"
"You are awake."
"They are cool."
"That suits us."
"She came in."
"On the train."
"This is Victor."
"Lock the doors."
"The whole story."
"Goodbye, Jim."
"Take your seats."
"You seem surprised."
"Popcorn?"
"This way."
"Shall we see each other?"
"This is Liz."
"Are you touched?"
"Are you affected?"
"Believe in yourself."
"Notify the police."
"We know her."
"Are you coming tomorrow?"
"I will prove it."
"Jump with me."
"Let her sleep."
"No more time."
"To love."
"This is Amanda."
"Do you like to dance?"
"He knows you."
"But from whom?"
"Just to say."
"You will be perfect."
"It's flooded."
"OK, I see."
"Just a beer."
"Are you out?"
"Good night, Father."
"Like brothers."
"Look at the camera."
"Who does what?"
"What a beautiful evening."
"Are you telling me?"
"I am a witness."
"I obeyed."
"Come on a little."
"He must be sleeping."
"Keep breathing."
"Go ahead, go back."
"No evidence."
"From the earth."
"We'll take you."
"Save your saliva."
"To protect us."
"It's cut."
"You'll get there."
"You too, right?"
"Say his name."
"This is Sara."
"He sees everything."
"It's regular."
"Can I leave?"
"Where is Nate?"
"I accept them."
"And your arm?"
"Call a taxi."
"Okay, buddy."
"Is he on drugs?"
"We'll come back."
"Look at the sky."
"He is modest."
"Not for sale."
"Can I know?"
"In the United States."
"I was looking at you."
"They are free."
"He is protected."
"But why him?"
"You were superb."
"At my parents' house."
"I admire that."
"They are here."
"But from where?"
"Keep me company."
"Here's the rub."
"Take command."
"You're stuck."
"Are you doing this?"
"He will be delighted."
"It was fascinating."
"And all that."
"He is cunning."
"Smile a little."
"In a hospital."
"He travels a lot."
"Who will be there?"
"I'm toast."
"That would explain everything."
"No hospital."
"What does it represent?"
"Are you Jewish?"
"He was strong."
"Here, my darling."
"I investigated."
"In between."
"They always come back."
"A lot of time."
"This is Sophie."
"But go ahead."
"Do you know her?"
"Close the window."
"Your grandfather?"
"He will pass."
"But guess what?"
"Two and a half."
"I prefer to stay."
"Drink something."
"I understand, really."
"He could have."
"Spare me that."
"As I was saying."
"She tried."
"It won't happen."
"Does this happen often?"
"I dreamed."
"And this girl?"
"The weather is good."
"An email?"
"Yeah, like that."
"It's ambitious."
"It's in there."
"On the coast."
"We understand each other."
"More water."
"And at your place?"
"We are rich."
"New Jersey?"
"Spread the word."
"It was normal."
"I had a flat tire."
"And your evening?"
"Guys, listen."
"How's it going, man?"
"In the shed."
"To the infirmary."
"They will be fine."
"Everything is locked."
"It's subtle."
"A black coffee."
"Well, go ahead."
"And I will come back."
"Are you coming to eat?"
"I commit."
"To the car."
"Right, Mom?"
"Why this stop?"
"What does it contain?"
"What were you looking for?"
"Just one hour."
"I will do everything."
"One more effort."
"Send the sauce."
"But without me."
"She looks at me."
"Yes, see you later."
"You should know."
"Not this way."
"He was handsome."
"Good news."
"Do you want to answer?"
"It's intentional."
"Can he talk?"
"It's on."
"Take the controls."
"Fix this for me."
"I'll take it."
"It makes you want to."
"A young girl."
"How much of what?"
"To protect her."
"Not a trace."
"Who will it be?"
"We see you."
"Why talk about it?"
"She accepted."
"Who says that?"
"Like a charm."
"Thank you very much, gentlemen."
"He cut."
"She was going to leave."
"People are waiting."
"Let's go talk outside."
"A charming man."
"Watch your words."
"I would like to come."
"I was in a hurry."
"I wanted to check."
"I like to win."
"The good life."
"Who left?"
"Listen to your father."
"With immediate effect."
"Who paid?"
"Sing for me."
"And my husband?"
"You've grown old."
"I like to walk."
"Not in there."
"They are identical."
"Take off your cap."
"Come up with me."
"Goodbye, Father."
"Why do this?"
"At my command."
"For that, yes."
"He's coming back tomorrow."
"Easy, buddy."
"And the witnesses?"
"You're not listening."
"Status report."
"It's direct."
"For an hour."
"To the left."
"I wanted to come."
"Mr. Officer."
"Irrelevant."
"Up to the neck."
"Good luck, Captain."
"She is brave."
"And the apartment?"
"I am unforgivable."
"Same for us."
"They are looking for him."
"But why here?"
"You're fine."
"I have to pick up."
"They are real."
"This is Joey."
"This is Julie."
"I'll drive you."
"In San Francisco."
"Are you parents?"
"Where is Wilson?"
"I'm Joel."
"You will be free."
"They love you."
"She kisses you."
"Look at his head."
"This is Justin."
"It's black."
"That would be lovely."
"It helps a lot."
"Was it serious?"
"Thanks, guys."
"Will you be nice?"
"Him and me."
"Tell me when."
"Strength and honor."
"Do you travel a lot?"
"I was in love."
"Are you shy?"
"It means a lot."
"Yes, last night."
"We work here."
"No, we're staying."
"I'm watching them."
"I am sensitive."
"They are in love."
"Do you live there?"
"Can he hear me?"
"Come, my treasure."
"I will tell you everything."
"Another bottle."
"You are cool."
"Captain's order."
"Come on, see you later."
"Come back tomorrow morning."
"Not for them."
"Since yesterday evening."
"Are you a musician?"
"We are everywhere."
"Not a cent."
"One more hour."
"Two hundred dollars."
"She was superb."
"No meat."
"I want to, yes."
"This time, yes."
"It's American."
"I start tomorrow."
"And the letter?"
"They tried."
"Does it really exist?"
"Like this one?"
"Oh, my heart."
"Let me introduce you."
"After the wedding."
"With whom?"
"Where is Carlos?"
"I am a dad."
"It's medical."
"And what about her?"
"Breathe with me."
"Live a little."
"She is extraordinary."
"It's irresistible."
"Good night, Will."
"This is your commander."
"Look at the screen."
"What was he saying?"
"It was strong."
"Where is Aaron?"
"I had everything."
"Everything is known."
"Ah, so much the better."
"How many of us are there?"
"In the army."
"And your trip?"
"Please take a seat."
"Around here."
"Let's take our time."
"A real pleasure."
"That kind."
"It's pink."
"Nobody wins."
"No footprint."
"Let's go through there."
"Go out with me."
"Quick, let's go."
"Are you leaving too?"
"She is possessed."
"In the attic."
"Where is Audrey?"
"A dog barks."
"Can I drink?"
"God knows why."
"He disgusts me."
"She is smart."
"Are you blocked?"
"In the countryside."
"Before leaving."
"She gets dressed."
"Change your tone."
"I would like that too."
"Good luck, darling."
"The next morning."
"Good evening, children."
"You're done for."
"It sounds perfect."
"Where is Harvey?"
"We are Americans."
"I keep my word."
"I'm staying too."
"I think the same."
"Yes, my king."
"I am Irish."
"Welcome, my friend."
"Leave the city."
"That makes five."
"This is Morgan."
"Take something."
"Same modus operandi."
"Not here either."
"He was great."
"I started again."
"And the music?"
"It keeps me busy."
"Good evening to you."
"How far are we?"
"And in there?"
"Especially women."
"Just a kiss."
"In single file."
"At what level?"
"Thank you for the information."
"He promised."
"The one on the left."
"No closer."
"For both."
"I was helping him."
"Good luck, Dad."
"Okay, whatever."
"Stay in bed."
"Yes, I think so."
"Well, there you have it."
"I play more."
"Who can know?"
"It's noble."
"He knew her."
"It is full."
"This is Jesse."
"And later?"
"Call the police?"
"Philadelphia Police."
"They are separated."
"You were together?"
"Stay on him."
"Where is Mason?"
"It could have."
"He will forgive you."
"Everything is ruined."
"Police siren."
"Yes, yes, thank you."
"Pull the trigger."
"He is an architect."
"It's miraculous."
"From what?"
"Thank you, my good man."
"He was high."
"Are you coming home already?"
"The good news?"
"No magic."
"Let him out."
"You wanted to talk."
"Repeatedly."
"She is tough."
"Drink your tea."
"Read on."
"No wallet."
"They passed."
"Did she eat?"
"Yes, all of that."
"He is attractive."
"This is Logan."
"I am satisfied."
"And the plane?"
"You should watch."
"On the bus."
"I was hiding."
"I farted."
"Change of direction."
"Follow my finger."
"Do you believe them?"
"I was pregnant."
"Take his legs."
"In space."
"Good, my boy."
"It looks like me."
"You sing well."
"Just around the corner."
"I'll take some."
"In three weeks."
"To thank you."
"Look at the picture."
"I was having fun."
"Here is his address."
"Thank you for understanding."
"Energy."
"Within the hour."
"It's signed."
"End of course."
"Good night, baby."
"When are they arriving?"
"I will write to him."
"Where is Jacob?"
"He's toast."
"I'll make everything right."
"No speech."
"I'm going with it."
"And the gasoline?"
"Do you want to come by?"
"Your coffee, sir."
"Phone number?"
"It exploded."
"Hold his head."
"Did you accept?"
"Where is Vince?"
"I am a sleepwalker."
"It will be wonderful."
"That's the work."
"Come on, over to you."
"You are me."
"We hide."
"And the cake?"
"Without fail."
"Take a cigarette."
"One of each."
"You signed."
"Are you leaving now?"
"He works there."
"It's physical."
"Oh yes, thank you."
"Put on your helmet."
"It's chic."
"Get out of the car."
"No, from me."
"I should answer."
"I am grateful."
"How many balls?"
"It's coded."
"The film begins."
"Just a few hours."
"This is the house."
"From the city."
"You are tough."
"They will find you."
"Turn on the radio."
"Where is Bruce?"
"Hello, little brother."
"It's out."
"Do you see us?"
"With my wife."
"The little girl."
"She lives here."
"The high class."
"How would you do it?"
"Lemonade?"
"Have you watched?"
"No visitors."
"Yes, Grandma."
"From whom, then?"
"And the people?"
"I work a lot."
"Put down that phone."
"He knew everything."
"And the neighbors?"
"So, how's it going?"
"Yes, and then what?"
"I look at him."
"He is a minor."
"Here and here."
"Too many memories."
"Go talk to them."
"Oh, look at you."
"Take the bag."
"And the kids?"
"Shall we go for a walk?"
"To celebrate this."
"Yes, my mother."
"My favorite dish."
"What do I hear?"
"Well, that's fine."
"Let's keep in touch."
"Yes, a few."
"And the truth?"
"Cards on the table."
"No, never seen it."
"Come on, get out of here."
"I'll take it back."
"A nice guy."
"I'm calling mom."
"No bullshit."
"How do they know?"
"No, not very."
"So, girls?"
"I studied."
"She is black."
"Are you going to open?"
"They are old."
"Yes, that's enough."
"Now, excuse me."
"Same time tomorrow?"
"My mother-in-law."
"Sorry, sweetie."
"I got divorced."
"They know each other."
"His phone rings."
"In the city center."
"He's OK."
"Up to what?"
"I can win."
"And thank you very much."
"My guardian angel."
"I would love to come."
"This is Gloria."
"Let her in."
"So, this dinner?"
"They are working on it."
"It was divine."
"It should hold."
"Hey, look at me."
"Here is the program."
"I am a priest."
"You are famous."
"Yes, my sister."
"I ask myself."
"Congratulations, by the way."
"A big thank you."
"He's managing."
"At my sister's."
"And my work?"
"Are you calling him?"
"Only one person."
"Do you want to win?"
"A matter of principle."
"Tell him no."
"Let me understand."
"I was waiting for this."
"Here, my dear."
"I'll take you on board."
"Just like him."
"They kiss."
"How does he know?"
"Hello, young people."
"He says that?"
"Take your positions."
"You have to keep going."
"Pay attention to it."
"Many deaths."
"Where was she going?"
"Hello, uncle."
"Where is Morgan?"
"Less than you."
"No food."
"With my son."
"Just out of curiosity."
"With his mother."
"His cell phone rings."
"Shall we eat together?"
"There are four of us."
"And the trip?"
"Are you standing?"
"And you, man?"
"Where is Amanda?"
"Are you reassured?"
"The routine, what."
"He would do it."
"He's finished."
"You are suspended."
"Look at this girl."
"How much do you earn?"
"If I knew."
"And his friends?"
"And the parents?"
"But to whom?"
"And the light?"
"A good idea."
"At three o'clock."
"Nobody shoots."
"It will be different."
"Tonight, yes."
"Call the others."
"Where is James?"
"Who wants to try?"
"No, do it."
"Yes, not you?"
"It is clear."
"That reminds me."
"Not without a mandate."
"We have changed."
"I'm being watched."
"Be clearer."
"Nowadays."
"Upwards."
"You're serious."
"I promise nothing."
"He went up."
"When I can."
"In what condition?"
"With the tongue."
"It's foolproof."
"Where is Connor?"
"Take the orders."
"He understands me."
"It's appropriate."
"This is the living room."
"Oh, thank you, thank you."
"No right."
"Doors open."
"You shouldn't have come."
"Red wine."
"They can wait."
"It won't last."
"I'm going to turn it on."
"Your grandmother?"
"Stand up."
"Pack your things."
"Like a child."
"Park here."
"Yeah, that'll be fine."
"A one-way ticket."
"Three against one."
"It's automatic."
"Goodbye, Billy."
"Another woman?"
"No more signal."
"Since my birth."
"It's gigantic."
"Let us in."
"And the door?"
"He laughed."
"Look at your face."
"He is fabulous."
"It was close."
"Yes, very true."
"Abroad."
"You will go far."
"I was just checking."
"They are watching me."
"But of course."
"In the briefcase."
"Just one sip."
"More pressure."
"I confessed."
"Are you sitting?"
"And college?"
"She is fast."
"The bank wins."
"Drink with me."
"You are wanted."
"My first love."
"Why did you come?"
"Yeah, over there."
"I miss mom."
"To absent friends."
"He knows what?"
"Let's think about it."
"Engine room."
"Can't you guess?"
"Cream and sugar?"
"We were close."
"Where does this lead?"
"Please wait a moment."
"Safety first."
"Turn this off."
"So why not?"
"Yours faithfully."
"Are you still working?"
"Perfect, let's go."
"True, true."
"That's wise."
"Roger that, Galactica."
"Happy Mardi Gras."
"That evening."
"What to do there?"
"You are innocent."
"I prayed."
"You are direct."
"Yes, for example."
"What would he do?"
"With friends."
"Hold on, kiddo."
"He is famous."
"For the crew."
"To ours."
"He's going home."
"No power."
"It's taking shape."
"Do you speak Italian?"
"Do you want to repeat?"
"I know now."
"It's recorded."
"Here's his number."
"I practice."
"I will pray."
"Let's eat."
"Well, you see."
"And forever."
"To the right."
"All right, let's begin."
"No need to wait."
"Thirty-one."
"Bathroom."
"We must cross."
"You are observant."
"A phone rings."
"Six or seven."
"Come on, good luck."
"Rule number one."
"Not now, darling."
"No TV."
"And why not?"
"I help myself."
"You are the same."
"A good deal."
"On my desk."
"No promises."
"She is sorry."
"A true genius."
"Put your arms down."
"Stay on the ground."
"How does it feel?"
"I want to start again."
"Let me stay."
"Everything is wrapped up."
"Pizza."
"You can change."
"No mandate."
"I'm Nick."
"Take a step back."
"Can you translate?"
"Where is Dan?"
"Can you write?"
"Use your power."
"Clear and clean."
"He was young."
"Five or six."
"This is Lauren."
"He asked."
"This is Phil."
"Open your gift."
"At the time."
"Yes, my adjutant."
"Stand it up."
"Does he come often?"
"But you too."
"This is Michelle."
"Mom came home."
"And the victim?"
"He wants to talk."
"Done and done."
"Madam is served."
"Without wanting to."
"And the party?"
"At what address?"
"We should get started."
"How can I?"
"And up there?"
"I want to resign."
"He is a policeman."
"We accept it."
"Can I come?"
"Not good, that."
"At your disposal."
"Toothache."
"Under what pretext?"
"Well, not exactly."
"You have to pay."
"And drugs?"
"I have to clean."
"You're smart."
"Watch TV."
"That's the idea."
"I owe you?"
"You will find it."
"Just a girl."
"I'm the same."
"Use your imagination."
"It's Mickey."
"I'm taking advantage of it."
"Housemaid."
"I'm creating a diversion."
"When is he leaving?"
"The classic move."
"Power outage."
"Who, for example?"
"Where is Crichton?"
"Who do you want?"
"When is she coming?"
"Short time."
"With a friend."
"I will order."
"Goodbye, Bob."
"And high school?"
"I will be kind."
"Can you count?"
"Now, over to you."
"I do the same."
"And his face?"
"On the wall."
"Everything was planned."
"Merry Christmas, Dad."
"Thank you for what?"
"It's served."
"Need money?"
"She's tough."
"Are you sleepy?"
"How much do we have?"
"I tell you."
"I don't have any."
"She won't come."
"Go ahead, Mom."
"No, mine."
"He is here."
"Follow this car."
"I like to watch."
"I am intelligent."
"Where is Teddy?"
"It's going fast."
"Captain's orders."
"So many deaths."
"Yes, I would love to."
"Will you introduce me?"
"Not only that."
"Look at the result."
"Thank you, dear."
"She is recovering."
"Put on your glasses."
"Side by side."
"Put it in."
"You must act."
"The other night."
"He has some."
"Like a bird."
"Space?"
"Is this real?"
"Here's an idea."
"So, you see?"
"Say good night."
"Police check."
"He worked here."
"Come in, guys."
"For the family."
"Not like here."
"Were you serious?"
"Pie?"
"Do you know how to fly?"
"I am a soldier."
"I'm taking a shower."
"Where is Jamie?"
"I love to dance."
"In the parking lot."
"It pisses me off."
"It was sincere."
"But tell me."
"Change places."
"She has everything."
"Tea or coffee?"
"We have to think."
"All mine."
"Is he far away?"
"We fucked."
"It's going great."
"We have to see."
"Well received, check."
"A real lady."
"No, for nothing."
"Call back later."
"No, that one."
"Once is enough."
"A good thing."
"Are you against it?"
"Plus the fees."
"They are chasing us."
"Like a woman."
"Your real name."
"Just to talk."
"We are delighted."
"It was splendid."
"They are new."
"You will heal."
"So, how are you doing?"
"There you go, you see?"
"And I know."
"I was following you."
"Try to follow."
"The great love."
"Do your duty."
"He drank."
"We have started."
"Well, I guess."
"I cooked."
"Better than anyone."
"She is absent."
"Marijuana."
"Where is Castle?"
"Or this one?"
"Look at these people."
"Come here, man."
"Just the three of us."
"I had confidence."
"We adapt."
"On your desktop."
"What would he say?"
"Good night, boss."
"You have to go in."
"Are you sisters?"
"This is Kim."
"Sorry, my love."
"The weekend."
"I will listen to you."
"On the chair."
"Classified ads."
"So what now?"
"Mr. Secretary."
"Just two minutes."
"Roll up your sleeve."
"And my men?"
"And me with it."
"Cover yourself well."
"I will be discreet."
"Now get lost."
"Like yours."
"She will get there."
"Control room."
"It's incurable."
"There were four of them."
"All the way up."
"As much as needed."
"You are hired."
"I must intervene."
"By what means?"
"A small town."
"Yes, for a moment."
"Look straight ahead."
"All or nothing."
"Yes, what then?"
"For a woman."
"Farewell, my son."
"Who would have thought?"
"Look right."
"Follow a little."
"And you, Mom?"
"Show me a little."
"We start all over again."
"For one night."
"Is it permanent?"
"What do you eat?"
"It's elegant."
"Come, my brother."
"Which one was it?"
"Make your report."
"Are you going to try?"
"You are a writer."
"You dance well."
"He plays well."
"Were you following me?"
"Good evening, how are you?"
"I'm looking at this."
"Welcome to the USA."
"Easy, my dear."
"From both of you."
"She is sensitive."
"I follow them."
"And if not?"
"On what subject?"
"It can be learned."
"Open this for me."
"Where would he go?"
"Come, my love."
"Raise your arm."
"Old friends."
"A charming woman."
"Are you going to throw up?"
"You are tall."
"She liked it."
"And the trunk?"
"And with you."
"Thanks, me too."
"It's on purpose."
"We will come back to this."
"You smiled."
"Thanks, by the way."
"His right arm."
"Need what?"
"They were friends."
"It's sacred."
"What to watch out for?"
"Usually, yes."
"Just a few words."
"Not after that."
"They withdraw."
"Twenty percent."
"But later."
"Let's do something else."
"Prepare your things."
"For three years."
"Do you prefer that?"
"Do us a favor."
"Put down that gun."
"I'm Bob."
"Where is Tina?"
"On the desk."
"Let it all out."
"No camera."
"She doesn't know."
"What a beautiful story."
"More than anyone."
"And gold?"
"A simple formality."
"Hi, my dear."
"Just a minute, honey."
"They are behind."
"He is wanted."
"She had disappeared."
"Send reinforcements."
"It's peaceful."
"What is he looking for?"
"One last thing."
"A picnic?"
"So, what about you?"
"Pure genius."
"Oh, that's enough."
"Don't go down."
"I guide you."
"Are we going?"
"Hello and welcome."
"Rest now."
"We will protect you."
"You have to wait."
"It was sure."
"A real treat."
"Shall we drop you off?"
"In the ice."
"Two thousand dollars."
"This is Greg."
"There is your answer."
"In a word."
"He'll manage."
"It comforts me."
"Doesn't answer."
"No key."
"Can you turn it off?"
"Come on board."
"No, another one."
"Call your father."
"Please identify yourself."
"He helps us."
"It's spectacular."
"Do you feel me?"
"Winter is coming."
"You will never change."
"So let's do it."
"Mom is waiting for you."
"Come on, off to bed."
"Call the cops?"
"Twenty-five years old."
"You could hit."
"One more round."
"Yes, in theory."
"Here is the central."
"How much for that?"
"This is Julia."
"She was innocent."
"Did you sleep?"
"He is getting married."
"At least two."
"The White House."
"Listen to yourself speak."
"Not far enough."
"Intubation tray."
"So, anything new?"
"Nice and warm."
"For three months."
"Can we see?"
"Make some coffee."
"Who do you love?"
"Is she coming here?"
"Without a word."
"I take everything back."
"This is Kitty."
"And so much the better."
"And the two of us?"
"That one, yes."
"Open the cell."
"Oh yeah, why?"
"Back off, guys."
"He'll start again."
"I belong to you."
"Give them back to me."
"But not before."
"Do something else."
"You're tough."
"And in return?"
"Not now, thank you."
"Yes, I'm fine."
"You are old."
"This is Walt."
"This is Ross."
"Here, sweetie."
"She slipped."
"On the mouth."
"And the movie?"
"Yes, among others."
"Far from everything."
"That much?"
"Go apologize."
"Take the camera."
"Go see mom."
"The others are coming."
"He is in front."
"Try to guess."
"The last two."
"How was he?"
"Yes, right?"
"I start on Monday."
"Go see them."
"This is Andrew."
"Let's call a truce."
"Unbelievable but true."
"Where are you running to?"
"She is a model."
"Come through here."
"Come, my friend."
"And you others?"
"They are clean."
"I pay you."
"God knows where."
"Here is my offer."
"You don't want anything?"
"Call this number."
"At the doctor's."
"The same day."
"Are we still friends?"
"I am Mr."
"That would suit me."
"Yes, my heart."
"Where is Benton?"
"He'll be back soon."
"This is House."
"This is Rick."
"She is human."
"We had it."
"I love cooking."
"Are you going to play?"
"What do you understand?"
"Who's thirsty?"
"They are in it."
"She is an adult."
"Go ahead, doctor."
"This is Nate."
"No, look at me."
"Go on, my son."
"Slow forward."
"What were they like?"
"It's worth thinking about."
"Time will tell."
"He is hard."
"Dressed like that?"
"I'm going to turn it off."
"To see me?"
"She will win."
"He was tall."
"Speak more quietly."
"Enough for what?"
"We're arguing."
"It was justified."
"Did you think so?"
"This is Nina."
"Let's eat first."
"He will be ready."
"Calm down everyone."
"We made it happen."
"How many sugars?"
"Milk and sugar?"
"Come on a second."
"Painting."
"Does it still exist?"
"This is Patrick."
"She was wonderful."
"Keep rolling."
"I quite like it."
"Are you coming to dance?"
"You are invited."
"I have to revise."
"You are new."
"We are young."
"All others."
"Are you taken?"
"Hold your tongue."
"Go ahead, move forward."
"It was nobody."
"Not there yet."
"Dad is mean."
"No to what?"
"The real reason?"
"Not so close."
"This is Jamie."
"Yes, my little one."
"He is English."
"I respect them."
"With the children."
"Here is the explanation."
"He is a photographer."
"Any particular reason?"
"Thank you, my friends."
"Are you an engineer?"
"You interest me."
"Who are you protecting?"
"Just above."
"This is Leonard."
"You will be rewarded."
"It looked like it."
"This is Richie."
"Well, come in."
"Be at peace."
"Have a good day."
"Do you want to walk?"
"What's beautiful?"
"She is blonde."
"Have a coffee."
"Twenty-two years old."
"I want to drink."
"Here, my man."
"Take stock."
"I will marry you."
"This is Maya."
"I rang."
"I'll take that."
"Garlic."
"You are nice."
"Take your seats again."
"Where is Holly?"
"Certainly not me."
"It's a priority."
"Describe it to me."
"It's Batman."
"I guess so too."
"This is Nathan."
"I am left-handed."
"Yes, very pretty."
"Yes, for a long time."
"Here, try this."
"Are they real?"
"Analysis in progress."
"He is sleeping soundly."
"Thank you for your patience."
"Where is Damon?"
"Can she hear me?"
"Yes, at first."
"In six months."
"Never heard of that."
"With pleasure, madam."
"Not my style."
"You're leaving tomorrow."
"Well, see you tomorrow."
"Take your time."
"Yes, my master."
"I am patient."
"Not to him."
"Better for whom?"
"And your head?"
"Will you introduce us?"
"But why is that?"
"I'm tempted."
"But from you."
"I'm leaving soon."
"Here is the solution."
"Who wants to play?"
"No messages."
"Just one week."
"We'll be fine."
"Now, let's get to work."
"To my father."
"I could go on."
"You wouldn't dare."
"So, how was this day?"
"Is it reliable?"
"You start tomorrow."
"She's fair."
"To buy what?"
"God bless her."
"He's up for it."
"Shouts of joy."
"Come this way."
"In the north."
"Under the bridge."
"What do we win?"
"For dinner."
"That makes one."
"Where is Howard?"
"The storm is approaching."
"How much is left?"
"She is small."
"Find it for me."
"This is Elena."
"A good boy."
"Okay, good night."
"I am positive."
"Is it better?"
"It can change."
"I must insist."
"More games."
"It is safe."
"Hello yourself."
"End of the game."
"Praise be to Him."
"Do you speak Russian?"
"It is huge."
"Work for me."
"Let me laugh."
"Answer me honestly."
"Come and get them."
"Join the others."
"The biggest."
"Whenever I want."
"Are you going to give up?"
"Where is Kim?"
"I am sitting."
"Are you going away for a long time?"
"All right, now."
"They will call back."
"Hey, listen to me."
"Where is Zach?"
"Look left."
"And the key?"
"He will listen to me."
"It seemed like."
"Thank you for calling."
"For the wedding."
"I was looking at this."
"No, after you."
"Where is Linda?"
"He paid."
"I am served."
"Most of them, yes."
"How much is it?"
"We will find her again."
"What do you answer?"
"Your pass."
"I lived."
"I would be honored."
"And a woman."
"Do you speak Japanese?"
"In what form?"
"She is uncontrollable."
"In the subway."
"And the press?"
"She is fresh."
"Farewell, my friends."
"At a party."
"No more alcohol."
"Were you sincere?"
"The bridal suite."
"Where is Oliver?"
"I stayed."
"Keep pressing."
"Take your hand away."
"It's beyond us."
"Where is Fiona?"
"She's harassing me."
"She is rich."
"Everything is done."
"Good night, miss."
"A double whiskey."
"I'm smart."
"This is acceptable."
"There you have it, sir."
"In the afternoon?"
"We want it."
"Good morning, Your Honor."
"Goodbye, Sergeant."
"Now I can."
"And my parents?"
"Why protect it?"
"Upside down?"
"Let them come."
"Can we cut?"
"She is cured."
"That will suit me."
"This is my office."
"I'm a widower."
"Finished the work."
"This is Melissa."
"That's a bitch."
"Honey, look at me."
"Gather your men."
"And yet, yes."
"Not very strong."
"This is Deb."
"Lay down your weapons."
"An old acquaintance."
"Open your bag."
"It is justified."
"Not a minute."
"He is suffering."
"She's changing."
"Where is Toby?"
"Let's try this way."
"Name and number?"
"Just one word."
"Let's find a solution."
"Let's talk about us."
"Where is Stan?"
"Is that so?"
"And your meeting?"
"You don't see anything?"
"Thank you, my daughter."
"The game begins."
"It's Mary."
"Gather the men."
"Congratulations, my boy."
"Look at the stars."
"He is stressed."
"Who do I see?"
"It's organic."
"That's enough, thank you."
"Here's the boss."
"She is pure."
"Ah, you think so?"
"Routine check-up."
"Eat your soup."
"Excuse me again."
"In this state?"
"To the police."
"Thanks to that."
"Here is your change."
"In his dreams."
"Since you insist."
"All in position."
"I belong to him."
"Doctor's orders."
"Come on, let me see."
"He protects me."
"Where is Mother?"
"You are brilliant."
"I appreciate you."
"Not with her."
"Read it to me."
"Conference room."
"Call my lawyer."
"This is Hollywood."
"It's dramatic."
"Leave it here."
"What do you hope for?"
"That would be better."
"She is famous."
"It was God."
"From the United States."
"I recognize them."
"Him first."
"Previously on Alias."
"You arrive late."
"Follow my voice."
"Just a second, honey."
"Have you looked?"
"It was confidential."
"In the building."
"I'm waiting for them."
"Just like her."
"We are lucky."
"This is Jackie."
"Call my wife."
"Research in progress."
"Who knows why?"
"So, let's go."
"Unauthorized access."
"I'm Will."
"Where is Cameron?"
"In what capacity?"
"That will teach you."
"Get out of the vehicle."
"All right, Dad."
"And her husband?"
"Goal in sight."
"So, explain to me."
"Look at your hair."
"I respect her."
"Tell me frankly."
"We believe you."
"Bring it back here."
"We will continue."
"I am special."
"This is the bridge."
"No discussions."
"They knew each other."
"I would do the same."
"She wants me."
"In two words."
"Here's your coffee."
"Just a dream."
"Everything is complete."
"Not so bad?"
"For our children."
"I will have some."
"This old thing?"
"You are expected."
"None of your business."
"Do you want to participate?"
"Let's go, man."
"Try it like this."
"I ask him."
"Where is Derek?"
"This is Wu."
"In his apartment."
"And the jewelry?"
"On the second floor."
"I like to work."
"I forgive him."
"Like tonight."
"Good luck, old man."
"Four, five, six."
"Thank you, Mr. Stevens."
"But not only that."
"What was she wearing?"
"A true story."
"You are an accomplice."
"They know what?"
"This is Lily."
"She wanted it."
"Not with us."
"No, to no one."
"Thank you, with pleasure."
"Here's my idea."
"They were together."
"Open the bag."
"We lift it up."
"Where is Tim?"
"He is involved."
"Yes, I should."
"Do you want to sing?"
"Hello, my sister."
"From all of you."
"Here's your ticket."
"From New Jersey."
"Here are the papers."
"A new message."
"This is Beth."
"Read it yourself."
"They are the same."
"The pressure is mounting."
"Nobody comes in."
"He will win."
"I am a father."
"Close your mouth."
"A storm is coming."
"Half a day."
"Let's race."
"Bunch of amateurs."
"One is enough."
"He is stunned."
"Women, huh?"
"The whole team."
"Sorry, dear."
"This is Natalie."
"Go ahead, look."
"She exploded."
"That's my question."
"Here is the proof."
"You have to do it."
"It will be cool."
"They know you."
"What, how come?"
"Breathe in and out."
"For you, sir."
"Go ahead, start."
"In my house."
"Here is the deal."
"Try this one."
"In this season?"
"She's behind."
"My lucky charm."
"Put down the phone."
"Goodbye, Ben."
"I want to hear."
"Are you thinking about it?"
"Good, ma'am."
"How are they?"
"A good start."
"Follow the money."
"No, right."
"God is love."
"Rebuild your life."
"He liked it."
"One second, sir."
"Witchcraft."
"We'll start again tomorrow."
"On the island?"
"Hello, my handsome."
"Pack your bag."
"Just the truth."
"She knows him."
"She can stay."
"Call for reinforcements."
"I signed."
"Can you lower it?"
"You are heavy."
"I am attached."
"I work there."
"Fill up."
"Nothing will change."
"Well, not anymore."
"And the contract?"
"Just a moment, sir."
"Get a lawyer."
"Try something else."
"She was special."
"Oh, too bad."
"And my children?"
"Have a cigarette."
"It will be magnificent."
"Are we finished?"
"Yes, but when?"
"But calm down."
"So far, yes."
"Husband and wife."
"Did you order?"
"Have some tea."
"What were they saying?"
"I choose you."
"How many shots?"
"Let's go further."
"Excuse me, Mom."
"How fast?"
"Mom, look at me."
"Not strong enough."
"It complicates everything."
"This is Milo."
"It is blue."
"I loved them."
"You look alike."
"Sing with me."
"Yes, good luck."
"Let's go say hello."
"She walked."
"Wait for the signal."
"All right, boss."
"I'm mean."
"Choose your side."
"He's manipulating you."
"In principle, yes."
"This is Carlos."
"No more coffee?"
"Coconut."
"You have to decide."
"Can you sign?"
"With a woman."
"Like clockwork."
"He always wins."
"Hold my hand."
"This sucks."
"I will come tomorrow."
"And the evidence?"
"In the entrance."
"So much the better, then."
"You can land."
"Now we know."
"We will have to wait."
"Need company?"
"Call my office."
"Climb in there."
"This is Caroline."
"Choose a hand."
"Right, Bob?"
"Don't rush."
"Let's make an appointment."
"A remarkable man."
"For a few months now."
"I'm enjoying myself."
"Out loud."
"It's still raining."
"You were amazing."
"On the cheek."
"Where is Lee?"
"This is Catherine."
"He fights."
"I'll find you."
"It obsesses me."
"Will you teach me?"
"No dog."
"Set the table."
"Behind the head."
"In your head."
"Patience, my friend."
"The bell rings."
"It's experimental."
"Now leave me."
"Yes, it's coming."
"No trial."
"Tuck in your shirt."
"Are you a surgeon?"
"Keep a close eye on him."
"He is soaked."
"That's the difference."
"I am a mechanic."
"How does it end?"
"We have booked."
"This is Jill."
"She works there."
"Look, look, look."
"This is Lucas."
"We must go up."
"There you go, buddy."
"There was."
"Form a circle."
"Oh, come here."
"Give me a sign."
"Can you fix it?"
"No, you see."
"At least one."
"They are small."
"He is near."
"It obsesses him."
"Don't call anyone."
"Cause and effect."
"A happy family."
"Are you coming to play?"
"Where do you sleep?"
"He will find us."
"He breathes more."
"Pause."
"Before the war."
"Of all kinds."
"Witness protection."
"This is Chloe."
"We called."
"Yes, but who?"
"And the cameras?"
"Look at this thing."
"Mr. Deputy."
"A white man."
"They divorced."
"What's it about?"
"I envy them."
"We waited."
"Can she talk?"
"Who says what?"
"That was enough."
"She was adorable."
"You had it."
"My little finger."
"She will get better."
"Every detail counts."
"You are hilarious."
"Who would want that?"
"Are they?"
"I am naked."
"You have to study."
"Let's start with him."
"He parks."
"Well, perfect."
"He is calm."
"In the fireplace."
"You have to believe me."
"We're talking business."
"Take off your dress."
"What do we bet?"
"You would like her."
"You do that?"
"This is Tara."
"It needs to be checked."
"As you prefer."
"Fit for work."
"She is powerful."
"Put on your mask."
"I am famous."
"It's technical."
"This is Lee."
"This is Leo."
"Not good enough."
"He is there."
"Have a cigar."
"You, over there."
"Not a soul."
"Let's keep calm."
"You're not eating?"
"Go play outside."
"And a good one."
"Not very subtle."
"No party."
"I want to try again."
"And the man?"
"Stretch out your arm."
"At my desk."
"I demand it."
"I am a singer."
"Where is Frankie?"
"At my age?"
"To the sea."
"Why so late?"
"She didn't know."
"Great, thank you very much."
"Since my childhood."
"This is Betty."
"More champagne?"
"From the back."
"My respects, madam."
"This is Marcus."
"Do you want to learn?"
"It will pass quickly."
"Hello, Mr. Crown."
"Call me back soon."
"Shields at maximum."
"Everything is great."
"He is fascinating."
"Hello, my children."
"Yes, I hear."
"Take off your boots."
"You should check."
"Keep digging."
"Prepare your men."
"A short circuit."
"This is Angel."
"Come see us."
"This is my family."
"This is Donna."
"Let him speak."
"In the tunnel."
"No later."
"Are you a member?"
"They will have it."
"Play what?"
"Sorry, folks."
"I'm leaving again tomorrow."
"No identification."
"Not yet."
"Thank you for your support."
"And the dogs?"
"We will continue tomorrow."
"Be with me."
"How much do you bet?"
"Your last meeting?"
"For others."
"But good luck."
"I have to go back up."
"I want to listen."
"And beyond?"
"Starting tonight."
"He was white."
"In a few weeks."
"I won't pay."
"But I work."
"We can talk."
"Here is mine."
"He gets dressed."
"Where is Ian?"
"No, over there."
"Let's go next door."
"Not by you."
"It's uncontrollable."
"Where is Caroline?"
"Do you know how to do it?"
"It's loaded."
"I will repeat."
"Thank you, I think."
"Everything is real."
"She will listen to you."
"No more trouble."
"And look at me."
"Goodbye, ladies."
"For two days."
"Can you elaborate?"
"Thank you, Thing."
"There were several of them."
"No more power."
"This is your office."
"What do you mean, me?"
"You should consult."
"The Last Judgment."
"Where is Jeremy?"
"Hello, ma'am."
"He's arriving tomorrow."
"Happy birthday, darling."
"About two years."
"At the hairdresser's."
"Thanks to whom?"
"Are you holding me?"
"At the door."
"He's watching us."
"Not very often."
"Right in front of you."
"It costs nothing."
"So prove it."
"Wait over there."
"In the wardrobe."
"God knows what."
"This is Heather."
"It was brilliant."
"We are human."
"And what now?"
"Go through there."
"When do I go out?"
"You are committed."
"For girls."
"I would say that."
"You wanted it."
"Hold out your hand."
"Are you up?"
"The fastest."
"Go ahead, madam."
"She was unique."
"Nor for you."
"Don't sleep."
"Back home."
"Don't ask for anything."
"Are you reading this?"
"Ten more minutes."
"You can hear it."
"Just a moment, gentlemen."
"This is Jonathan."
"Night and day."
"We were in love."
"I have to understand."
"Are you going to continue?"
"No, I'm leaving."
"Exactly like me."
"See you soon then."
"Watch out for the doors."
"You ask me?"
"Congratulations to you."
"Everything will be ready."
"It's getting warmer."
"Like all of us."
"I turn around."
"I was gone."
"No, just a minute."
"Let's change places."
"I am a consultant."
"We can stay."
"With a man?"
"Do you never knock?"
"Yes, we're coming."
"And your men?"
"Very good news."
"I will come back to this."
"Take pictures."
"A hot dog?"
"You can start."
"We'll come back tomorrow."
"They're going to leave."
"Listen to this."
"I heal quickly."
"Are you apologizing?"
"Your cards, gentlemen."
"How many women?"
"Why was that?"
"At one o'clock."
"What do I what?"
"It was correct."
"And this trip?"
"Who's starting?"
"Where is Olivia?"
"Maid."
"Find one."
"We're fine."
"Like a fish."
"And me."
"Let us pray to the Lord."
"Let's go see them."
"Are you looking for us?"
"Each of you."
"Is it fresh?"
"His ex-wife."
"You loved it."
"Just coffee."
"Lift your chin."
"Where is Anne?"
"Hey, brother."
"In what position?"
"Let's take my car."
"Where is House?"
"Until Monday."
"Not me, you."
"Hold your position."
"Take a nap."
"Okay, let's see."
"Nothing exciting."
"Do you want to work?"
"Grab his legs."
"You can laugh."
"Maybe ten."
"Are you going to move?"
"I know who."
"Thanks a lot, man."
"Justice is done."
"Business or leisure?"
"Here's your chance."
"Great, let's go."
"It seems so, though."
"She will be ready."
"The other thing."
"I was a cop."
"I'll be careful."
"Thank you very much, Dad."
"It was agreed."
"And the driver?"
"He is Russian."
"No, very well."
"They are serious."
"Here are my friends."
"Call the hospital."
"Are you taking him?"
"He is sincere."
"On the counter."
"On your right."
"I control everything."
"Others don't."
"Go ahead, breathe."
"He was huge."
"We're bringing him back."
"Go clean yourself up."
"I'll go too."
"Who dared?"
"In a car."
"If you accept."
"And in what way?"
"So follow me."
"Yes, very often."
"Thanks, Mom."
"She is white."
"From both of us."
"This is Christine."
"Is it still holding?"
"Go ahead, touch."
"Let go of my arm."
"How to convince you?"
"He is ambitious."
"It's accurate."
"This is Hannah."
"Real life."
"I don't dare."
"Who votes for?"
"And listen to this."
"From your father."
"Who replaces him?"
"Make her come."
"Excuse me, old man."
"On my account."
"You deserved it."
"He is known."
"Are you an actor?"
"Nothing, I hope."
"Coke."
"Can you play?"
"I will wear it."
"Finish your glass."
"And my kiss?"
"Another call."
"She is a lawyer."
"Not like some."
"Ah, I know."
"Go ahead, ask."
"Paper or plastic?"
"Easy, boy."
"Everything is political."
"They come here."
"And you, miss?"
"This changes everything."
"In a motel."
"Come on, be nice."
"It was sexy."
"I'll sort it out."
"You have to go down."
"They are charming."
"Put your pants back on."
"They paid."
"There was no one."
"You are witnesses."
"He will find you."
"Good, my dear."
"Where is Foreman?"
"As much as you."
"She must be sleeping."
"Hello, friend."
"This is your captain."
"This is Linda."
"I cover it."
"Thank you, good night."
"We're finding out."
"Go ahead, swing."
"Ask your question."
"In what sense?"
"Know one thing."
"You would do the same."
"Everything is recorded."
"Can you come by?"
"It is intact."
"Oh, come on, man."
"I'm leaving immediately."
"Is it hidden?"
"Are you hurrying?"
"I will succeed."
"No follow-up."
"Go ahead, get in."
"Blonde or brunette?"
"This is Wayne."
"Before my eyes."
"One more day."

"They canceled."
"What were they looking for?"
"They are in front."
"It will be over."
"From a friend."

"Only one solution."
"And the prisoners?"
"About me?"
"A private detective?"
"Clean up."
"Follow the light."
"End of game."
"Daddy loves you."
"Keep it hidden."
"I am being watched."
"For whom then?"
"With someone?"
"In the rules."
"But I can."
"No address."
"Hopefully not."
"I am a therapist."
"They speak English."
"Call the doctor."
"All right, that's it."
"At your post."
"I will accept."
"Who to call?"
"What are you up to?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, good evening."
"Maybe soon."
"Even higher."

"Bring them up."
"Come on, let's do it."
"You're young."
"And here's why."

"I'm choking."
"A new world."
"Are you excited?"
"But for you."
"In my apartment."
"Facing me."
"Good night, little one."
"And my share?"
"On the line."
"Sorry, kids."

"With your family."
"Yes, Grandpa."
"Raise your glasses."
"And that was it?"
"Did you come in?"
"That's the deal."

"Silk."
"What to say to him?"
"I will pay for it."
"Tell me yes."
"A few more steps."
"A matter of survival."
"Yeah, that too."
"No, take it."
"Yeah, one second."
"It seems obvious."
"Can I try again?"
"No luggage?"
"Take the stairs."
"Take my bag."

"Will you open the door?"
"Where is Piper?"
"This is Jess."

"God forgive me."
"In Utah."
"He adores me."
"You're mean."
"Let's introduce ourselves."
"I'm Molly."
"Or the opposite."
"I am enthusiastic."
"Now look at this."
"Who would want some?"
"Salad?"
"There, on the right."
"They are all asleep."
"Even closer."
"On the hunt."
"For no reason."
"Change course."
"Captain's bridge."

"He bit."
"I liked her."
"The sat goes up."
"Where is Dylan?"
"Come on, my pretty."
"She will be happy."
"It will be the same."
"I was small."
"For justice."
"They are blue."
"As for me."
"It was obligatory."
"Family affair."
"No more calls."
"A true marvel."
"But it will pass."
"I'm going to pick up."
"I'll guide you."
"What are we taking?"
"But she does."
"Hi, guys."
"You would do well."
"Is she?"
"It's impeccable."
"It is impeccable."
"Why this argument?"
"Do we know why?"
"No more juice."
"Let's do this quickly."
"I always come back."
"In peace."
"A Friday night?"
"Go straight."
"Caused by what?"
"Well, here you are."
"I am amazing."
"Where, for example?"

"It fits perfectly."
"Give me your bag."
"A good choice."
"I was ready."
"He is an actor."
"But why you?"
"You intrigue me."
"This is Aaron."
"And the hostages?"
"You are single."
"What would I do?"
"You understand everything."
"For weeks."
"Nice, at your place."
"I noted."

"Do you know us?"
"Am I being punished?"
"Why start now?"
"You are excused."
"A little baby."
"Need no one."
"Don't be."
"I will protect her."
"Free your mind."
"We should move."
"Please stay on hold."
"As much as me."
"They are still searching."
"Invent something."
"What about my rights?"
"I continued."
"Once again."
"Why these screams?"
"The usual place."
"But that, yes."
"Would it be him?"
"They were waiting for me."
"It would seem so."
"And others."
"And we continue."
"Tell me who."
"This is Neil."
"Do you want to count?"
"At six o'clock."
"Go ahead, gentlemen."
"Do you admit it?"
"My little baby."
"Everything must go."
"Thanks in advance."
"Are you coming to see?"
"In a hotel."
"Give the alert."
"She was looking for you."
"You have chosen."
"I was good."
"You have to learn."
"A happy ending."
"Not long."
"What do you smell?"
"This is my opinion."
"My phone rings."
"Shall we go home together?"
"No flowers."
"They knew it."
"Stay on course."
"Are you coming for dinner?"
"It was deliberate."
"They have changed."
"Here comes the cavalry."
"I just..."
"No story."
"She is friendly."
"It scares me."
"A great guy."
"No arrangement."
"I would talk to him."
"They will get there."
"You could wait."
"It's electric."
"Good night, Captain."
"Please wait here."
"I have evolved."
"Guys, come on."
"Go back to class."
"I'm going fishing."
"A nice thing."
"Me, of course."
"I have to cancel."

"And the hotel?"
"Keep dreaming."
"And Merry Christmas."
"For how many nights?"
"Might as well get it over with."
"Not so long ago."
"I do everything."
"Oh, good idea."
"You think so?"
"And you with it."
"Come up there."
"Let's start from scratch."
"She talks too much."
"I should stay."
"What would happen?"
"In the river."
"I'll get rid of you."
"I'm just checking."
"Did you pay?"
"Come on, come dance."
"In twenty minutes."
"I wanted to change."
"Can I come down?"
"I was going to call."
"He is training."
"The target is approaching."
"In what genre?"
"Hard left."
"Clear the deck."
"She is terrifying."
"Check it out for yourself."
"Happy birthday, Mom."
"How do you get home?"
"They are rare."
"In the world."
"So you know."
"You ask?"
"This is Ed."
"Less than that."
"Did he sign?"
"Are you interested in her?"
"This is Brad."
"Did you decide?"
"Yes, my baby."
"Take your day."
"And five."
"They can't."
"Are you waking up?"
"Why at my place?"
"To what question?"
"Who would believe it?"
"It doesn't work."
"God bless them."
"What will you have?"
"I know how to dance."
"Do I really have to?"
"I adapt."
"Mom, let it go."
"No parents."
"Security reasons."
"Where is Spencer?"
"And have a good trip."
"And us with it."
"He will find her."
"Who knows her?"
"But with whom?"
"Straight ahead."
"Dad, listen to me."
"How are you, little one?"
"God bless us."
"Can you speed up?"
"I'm wet."
"She can wait."
"We have to end this."
"What will we see?"
"Together forever."
"A hold-up?"
"A lot, actually."
"We must hold on."
"Police officer."
"Will you do that?"
"Are you sitting down?"
"She knows nothing."
"I ask you."
"We danced."
"No keys."
"And the guards?"
"I will teach him."
"And the meeting?"
"I'll take that off."
"Go ahead, Garcia."
"Piece by piece."
"No, it was fine."
"It was exceptional."
"You are a minor."
"What other things?"
"Everything was normal."
"Just a little one."
"You should try it."
"Lots of water."
"Keep turning."
"In a trunk."
"We must begin."
"From the outside."
"She was delighted."
"Where is Zack?"
"He is mortal."
"Any other comments?"
"Good morning, Your Majesty."
"Would you like to play?"
"From home."
"See him."
"What was he looking for?"
"I see, sir."
"Turn it up."
"I'm telling the truth."
"I sell them."
"Of himself."
"Can you sing?"
"It's going to cut."
"She has to eat."
"Pull up your pants."
"Excuse me, man."
"This is Ali."
"How can I tell you?"
"Here, right here."
"All but one."
"Go further."
"He is sublime."
"Talk to him, you."
"Very good, really."
"Each of us."
"She is haunted."
"No baby."
"Nothing so far."
"Do you take any?"
"He was brilliant."
"No explanation."
"And that noise?"
"Like every year."
"I am an artist."
"I am Eric."
"You too, darling."
"That was clever."
"Not you, darling."
"Go without me."
"It's stimulating."
"Oh, yes, thank you."
"It excites him."
"Drink your milk."
"We apologize."
"Just in case."
"Purpose of the stay?"
"Prosecutor's Office."
"Good evening, friends."
"Yes to what?"
"What was she?"
"Before and after."
"I believe so."
"Not too tight?"
"In the earth."
"And my hair?"
"In Queens."
"For my own good?"
"It will do."
"Touch wood."
"Say your price."
"All right, go ahead."
"It's outside."
"Here's a hint."
"Justice will be done."
"I gave in."
"Good night, princess."
"For my people."
"Sorry, Your Honor."
"Everything looks the same."
"A hot chocolate."
"Who do I call?"
"I would have it."
"Who is Rita?"
"This is Barney."
"One hundred percent."
"Where is Noah?"

"So, this audition?"
"Are you an artist?"
"I want to go up."
"A new car?"
"Bye, see you tomorrow."
"We'll do that."
"Behind this door."
"He was cool."
"Bring the car."
"Where is Brad?"
"I am awake."
"When are you arriving?"
"It's cultural."
"Oh, my man."
"Let's go talk to them."
"Take your torches."
"Where do I live?"
"She says that?"
"Just a moment, Captain."
"He knows us."
"Easy on that."
"I'll see you again."
"But not there."
"More than this."
"See you later, Dad."
"Go over it."
"Call the block."
"I am white."
"We understood."
"They have to."
"Hey, that's enough."
"Can I, Mom?"
"Keep up the good work."
"She accompanies me."
"Better than before."
"I hear that."
"Which boyfriend?"
"In Connecticut."
"I have to write."
"Yes, let's talk about it."
"Let's go to the movies."
"I moved forward."
"And a friend."
"Here are my conditions."
"The storm is coming."
"Look who's coming."
"It's poisoned."
"Dress well."
"Are you open?"
"This is different."
"What, exactly?"
"Take your car."
"This is Dennis."
"He is a musician."
"How many horses?"
"How many survivors?"
"Luck turns."
"It all fits together."
"A little kiss."
"We rest."
"I was innocent."
"And I sympathize."
"Need a vacation?"
"Ready to launch."
"They are rich."
"This is Spencer."
"What about medications?"
"Good morning, Mr. Bond."
"Go tell them."
"All in place."
"Thank you for coming."
"But listen to this."
"What a beautiful baby."
"Acid."
"And my baby?"
"Here is your gift."
"You have to sign."
"Among others."
"For my family."
"It was mind-blowing."
"A little pick-me-up?"
"Your little girl?"
"Kiss me again."
"Are you okay?"
"Hey, pretty."
"Look at this man."
"I can guess."
"Not for me anymore."
"With milk."
"Cut the rope."
"And his hair?"
"DNA?"
"Don't sing."
"Are you asleep already?"
"Keep eating."
"Hangover?"
"The Twilight Zone."
"Where is Janet?"
"Who has some?"
"Good night, Jim."
"Where is Chloe?"
"Look at me now."
"I want it."
"Except no."
"A little kiss?"
"He is left-handed."
"She despises me."
"Without knowing it."
"Ron is right."
"Let them try."
"Nothing planned."
"And our children?"
"This is Gabriel."
"Great art."
"The cavalry is coming."
"Wait, you'll see."
"And that smell?"
"I will act."

"Wait for the beep."
"I can breathe."
"Are there many of you?"
"He is bald."
"But they know."
"You pay attention."
"A real delight."
"God is everywhere."
"Were you pretending?"
"A little drop?"
"Should I repeat?"
"Do you feel anything?"
"He is impressive."
"Where is Sofia?"
"The shields hold."
"In the alley."
"You will see her."
"She was mean."
"No distractions."
"You two, outside."
"The white rabbit."
"I am a screenwriter."
"Like crystal."
"The wind is blowing."
"And his cell phone?"
"Yes, Mr. Shaw."
"Right from the start."
"Bring some wine."
"Oh, let's see."
"It's okay."
"House was right."
"How are you, kid?"
"Should I undress?"
"Is it done?"
"Finally, here you are."
"Helping people."
"Welcome to Chicago."
"Who disappeared?"
"Security check."
"It's nobody's business."
"Not very good."
"Step by step."
"A bell rings."
"Go take a shower."
"In which city?"
"This is Ian."
"No, never again."
"Did you talk?"
"What about the Jedi?"
"Make me proud."
"Here is an example."
"Clean all that up."
"Where is Jo?"

"The real world?"
"But believe me."
"We are touched."
"Ready to go home?"
"What is he waiting for?"
"The secret services?"
"Good luck, Lieutenant."
"I'm going to drink."
"I'm going to leave."
"Make peace."
"Oh, yes."
"And the photo?"
"Luckily for us."
"It haunts me."
"You will pay."
"She was cool."
"The weather was nice."
"Open the box."
"They will try."
"Where is Jess?"
"The day arrives."
"He was black."
"She was married."
"That seems correct."
"How is Ben?"
"I wanted to see."
"Keep this for me."
"No point in trying."
"For the three of us."
"Where is Locke?"
"Think of her."
"Protect and serve."
"I could."
"Read this to me."
"I am perfect."
"Don't back down."
"Very well, Lieutenant."
"For three days."
"I am indestructible."
"Okay, kids."
"But who counts?"
"On my honor."
"Find the girl."
"With a smile."
"What about the FBI?"
"You're out."
"Stand up, my boy."
"They gave up."
"Yes, I must."
"Yes and yes."
"Go ahead, laugh."
"Here are your keys."
"They were kind."
"And the ball?"
"They are fresh."
"Where is Gordon?"
"He is breathing well."
"Drink your glass."
"In the sky."
"Does she turn you on?"
"In the nape of the neck."
"Call the FBI."
"You look different."
"Keep smiling."
"I can succeed."
"Yeah, I can."
"And then this."
"They will get you."
"Have a cookie."
"How do we get down?"
"Who wants to come?"
"Are they looking for me?"
"Calm down now."
"During the week."
"He wants to leave."
"A whole life."
"For my business."
"Are you Russian?"
"Prepare for the jump."
"In the rain."
"Take your phone."
"For his birthday."
"There are five of us."
"Spring is coming."
"Act as if."
"Not you, him."
"Are you a psychiatrist?"
"I will survive it."
"Bring him to us."
"The helicopter is coming."
"Lucky for you."
"I wrote."
"Enough questions."
"And a beer."
"I'll see about that."
"He guessed."
"It was serious."
"I am a banker."
"Why did you accept?"
"How much do you owe?"
"Nor for me."
"Hold the door."
"Not in person."
"We're going to stay."
"I resisted."
"Where are we now?"
"Crew Commander."
"Goodbye, Tim."
"You like me."
"Guard the door."
"He calls her."
"Yes, I admit it."
"Come get us."
"Pick up your things."
"Is she conscious?"
"The boat is arriving."
"With you, yes."
"When am I leaving?"
"Good evening, my angel."
"A good package."
"We'll take you back."
"Who does it?"
"What was he wearing?"
"And your first name?"
"One minute, sir."
"Only by reputation."
"You can let go."
"Do you play it?"
"You must answer."
"Is Tony here?"
"What are you risking?"
"And the sound?"
"Not anytime soon."
"This is Marco."
"Here's the ball."
"I finally understand."
"Here is my question."
"In the cockpit."
"Can I open?"
"He is remarkable."
"You loved me."
"It's modern."
"I order it."
"Is it safe?"
"She is close."
"Well done, soldier."
"Now, off to bed."
"I confirm it."
"I see, thank you."
"And the last one."
"For three weeks."
"Look, you see?"
"I am invited."
"Wait for orders."
"Here is your mother."
"Are we still playing?"
"Indeed, madam."
"No head."
"Oh yeah, that."
"I'm hanging up now."
"In his pocket."
"Where is Cora?"
"No, I'll go."
"Take it upon yourself."
"It is gigantic."
"Bring them here."
"I am being followed."
"She was gifted."
"This guy?"
"Imagine the scene."
"She obsesses me."
"It's white."
"Just as a precaution."
"Are we clear?"
"In ten years."
"One more game."
"So, do you like it?"
"He wants to go out."
"Close the curtains."
"Let's go rest."
"A beautiful story."
"Right at the end."
"Who would it be?"
"And you, old man?"
"She is interesting."
"It will come back to you."
"I won't do it again."
"Like a dream."
"Three, actually."
"And his business?"
"Shall we call him?"
"Are you fighting?"
"The dog barks."
"I was a lawyer."
"No bullets."
"No plate."
"How to get there?"
"On your signal."
"Where is Logan?"
"Say something."
"I'm coming home tomorrow."
"No guards."
"He speaks Russian."
"Where is Ron?"
"With my compliments."
"Hey, you two."
"Part-time."
"No need to answer."
"She's having fun."
"She knows you."
"No, I was working."
"My dear child."
"And our luggage?"
"Were you expecting us?"
"The Grand Canyon."
"Goodbye, Nick."
"A little, yes."
"I'm chasing him."
"No electricity."
"And a drink?"
"Go ahead, play."
"Thank you, that's enough."
"She will recover."
"Like a brother."
"Come upstairs."
"No white."
"She is French."
"Squirrel?"
"It makes me tired."
"You, this way."
"And these?"
"Keep your spirits up."
"I'll go see."
"Mayor's office."
"For the night."
"And four."
"This has to change."
"Take the other one."
"This is Vince."
"Nor mine."
"Not like before."
"So from whom?"
"Go join her."
"Hang up the phone."
"The speaker."
"This is Tina."
"Like a girl."
"This is Christopher."
"Okay, big guy."
"Who will do it?"
"So, call me."
"In this car."
"Goodbye, Tony."
"Make the call."
"Almost four years."
"I'm coming home late."
"The DNA matches."
"It's related."
"She is calm."
"A good cop."
"Take off your panties."
"Yes, it exists."
"It opens."
"Are you coming home soon?"
"Yes, I bet."
"Yes, very clear."
"No cell phone."
"We start now."
"And the revolver?"
"It's Damon."
"Where is Norman?"
"Give me your arm."
"And respect?"
"This is Monica."
"What did you believe?"
"I can ask."
"Not much longer."
"No, I'm managing."
"We catch up with them."
"You'll be great."
"Not his type."
"She'll manage."
"He greets you."
"Just a man."
"Don't look any further."
"Easy, friend."
"A new house?"
"I'm taking a big risk."
"She got fat."
"I will cooperate."
"No scene."
"All that what?"
"Give your price."
"Thank you, my brothers."
"I lived here."
"There are six of them."
"Where is Phoebe?"
"This is Dylan."
"As far as I know."
"Very good, thank you."
"No contract."
"This is Benjamin."
"They are big."
"Get up, come on."
"All present, sir."
"And the result?"
"We take them."
"My father is coming."
"Plan B?"
"What could be better?"
"And the address?"
"Twenty-eight years old."
"The great shape."
"And your hair?"
"You will get better."
"Take his statement."
"Call the switchboard."
"I have to wait."
"We sit down."
"Where is Mickey?"
"The blue bird."
"They know us."
"I will pay for everything."
"Sir is served."
"Say something else."
"Excuse me, General."
"He is lucky."
"I went down."
"Twenty-three years old."
"Is that enough?"
"But you don't."
"Are you abandoning us?"
"Yes, you see?"
"I won't come."
"This is Jennifer."
"He is an accountant."
"Yes, it matters."
"But what about you?"
"I knew them."
"They were in love."
"Give the money."
"You should accept."
"No operation."
"Vehicle documents."
"Let him live."
"You arrive early."
"Not cool, man."
"Thank you very much, thank you."
"It's sentimental."
"How is Karen?"
"It is green."
"But not them."
"She is asleep."
"He was amazing."
"To whom then?"
"Who lives there?"
"Very well, Sergeant."
"Just a picture."
"Do you miss them?"
"Are you gone?"
"All expenses paid."
"Could you come?"
"It would be easy."
"In what context?"
"Take your medicine."
"And with what?"
"All the money."
"He helps me."
"Look at my mouth."
"Just dinner."
"Until morning."
"Same for him."
"You seem happy."
"Make some noise."
"In the sea?"
"You are everywhere."
"I have to finish."
"Pure."
"It's borderline."
"But let's be clear."
"Where is Carrie?"
"A missing person."
"We move."
"Look at this view."
"You had everything."
"Not to that."
"How much will that be?"
"And the list?"
"During the war."
"Give them to him."
"But look at me."
"There, it will be fine."
"A great classic."
"Friendly advice."
"He is locked up."
"She wants to leave."
"Let's make a bet."
"Where is Barry?"
"There are five of them."
"Will you be home late?"
"Are you watching this?"
"Let them out."
"On the rocks?"
"He's harassing me."
"Not very original."
"On the radio."
"Sorry, big guy."
"Now rest."
"This is Jean."
"They'll get over it."
"I will fix it."
"With my money."
"For insurance."
"We must win."
"This is Jenna."
"I am independent."
"I am capable."
"And this glass?"
"Where is Ross?"
"For you, Mom."
"Where is Sally?"
"Necessity is the law."
"Forgot something?"
"Where is Robin?"
"Where is Heather?"
"Watch the movie."
"On my side."
"I am wise."
"Come on, friend."
"Is she beautiful?"
"Turn on the lights."
"Later, then."
"It never works."
"Not a person."
"Where is Joseph?"
"Are you getting up?"
"I am black."
"This will be interesting."
"I am a magician."
"Moment of truth."
"Where is Liam?"
"He can walk."
"Let her finish."
"In the fields."
"I vote yes."
"And the ring?"
"The full moon."
"He will be back soon."
"It will protect you."
"He will explain to you."
"And the birds?"
"At the last moment."
"Come on, my love."
"Look at us now."
"So, this party?"
"And fries."
"In perfect condition."
"Keep in touch."
"This is my brother."
"All for one."
"Keep filming."
"Show your cards."
"We are making good progress."
"From the company?"
"Just be careful."
"It changes us."
"For your father."
"I desire you."
"Bodyguard?"
"You will meet him."
"Make sure of it."
"Good night, Ben."
"I want to go back."
"Come see here."
"A whiskey and soda."
"Nice work, gentlemen."
"Here are two."
"He is magical."
"Who do you see?"
"I can do that."
"All week."
"I wear it."
"Not now, no."
"He found it."
"We are innocent."
"Here is the car."
"He must come."
"Not at his place."
"He heard."
"Good evening, Mr. Bond."
"Oh, that'll be fine."
"They are unique."
"Your way."
"Go downstairs."
"Where is Diego?"
"We're going camping."
"How would I say?"
"So, very good."
"Now we talk."
"I'm Carrie."
"In the neighborhood."
"He is questioned."
"What will they do?"
"Are you a priest?"
"You were pregnant."
"Black and white."
"Here is the kitchen."
"A car is approaching."
"She is exceptional."
"I recommend it."
"Look at that face."
"Lights out."
"We will ask."
"Well, good luck."
"Let's start from there."
"Do you feel them?"
"You can come back."
"All right, ladies."
"Call off your men."
"Your usual table?"
"Everything will end well."
"I am a patriot."
"Here is the map."
"I am a taxi driver."
"Will you be staying for a long time?"
"A submarine?"
"This is Samantha."
"Yes, in Paris."
"This is Hal."
"No radio."
"With my daughter."
"Oh, calm down."
"We're coming back."
"She kisses him."
"Wait for us here."
"We drank."
"My God, why?"
"You disobeyed."
"Well done, Bob."
"On the leg."
"And you, yes?"
"I'll transfer you."
"I'll be honest."
"At the very beginning."
"Do you see her?"
"Clear your mind."
"No, not for long."
"Exhibit."
"Are we okay?"
"Should I guess?"
"Two for me."
"It's young."
"I have to testify."
"For two months."
"Here is the mail."
"Good night, Colonel."
"I would have understood."
"How could he?"
"And for the gentleman?"
"He protects us."
"Don't slow down."
"You are a journalist."
"Open the doors."
"Iced tea?"
"Thank you, have a nice day."
"Who would do it?"
"I am a producer."
"Are you waiting for it?"
"In your bed."
"And you know?"
"A beautiful girl."
"Right, boss?"
"I am a Muslim."
"At the opera."
"Are you letting me go?"
"Put on your pants."
"For your husband."
"It has evolved."
"I was calling you."
"Cancel this order."
"Don't breathe anymore."
"They want you."
"Has she been drinking?"
"And take this."
"A raccoon."
"Just a few weeks."
"Yes, like what?"
"She had everything."
"Let's get to work then."
"Under what name?"
"I want to walk."
"It's erased."
"This is Carol."
"In the mirror."
"I gave."
"How many cards?"
"It escapes us."
"Look at the light."
"I can learn."
"We like it."
"I'm taking care of myself."
"He is indestructible."
"I would have thought."
"We're working here."
"Where is Chandler?"
"Who will believe you?"
"And the report?"
"No, calm down."
"Put him outside."
"They were looking for you."
"Given the circumstances."
"I will introduce you."
"In ten days."
"Heading north."
"Please step aside."
"They were everywhere."
"I am a pastor."
"But now, yes."
"So, get ready."
"She asks you."
"They loved each other."
"And the university?"
"And the judge?"
"I'll get it back."
"I like them."
"Everything depends on it."
"And these people?"
"Good evening, sir."
"If he survives."
"I do it."
"Look who's talking."
"It speaks to me."
"Will that be enough?"
"When will you know?"
"One of the two."
"Wait for the thing."
"It's Buffy."
"He wanted it."
"Out of stock."
"Where is Helen?"
"Goodbye, Patrick."
"From school."
"Can we order?"
"Thanks to this."
"Yes, old man."
"Until yesterday."
"How many employees?"
"A priori, yes."
"I love to travel."
"Now kiss me."
"Roger that, Houston."
"This is Trevor."
"So, do you accept?"
"Are you selling them?"
"Activate the shield."
"You are wise."
"It's okay here."
"Let's find something else."
"Yes, it helps."
"They are white."
"She is delighted."
"Yes, mine."
"Peace on earth."
"Look at me, Mom."
"Switch to impulse."
"Two hundred thousand."
"Where is Reed?"
"We follow her."
"Far from me."
"And the shoes?"
"Let's see what happens next."
"It was red."
"Twenty-six years old."
"Can't you hear anything?"
"Not in time."
"When it works."
"They get married."
"Aim for the head."
"He loves them."
"It's encrypted."
"Leave here."
"Can he come?"
"Safety measure."
"To myself."
"They belong to me."
"Come here, son."
"We live here."
"This big."
"When does it get hot?"
"Go first."
"That sounds great."
"He will try."
"Take the next one."
"Physically, I'm fine."
"Here is my hand."
"Want to participate?"
"Why are you calling?"
"They see us."
"Madam, are you okay?"
"She forgot."
"All right, come on."
"I cancel everything."
"Where is Marcus?"
"Where is Booth?"
"Really very beautiful."
"Of course, son."
"And you, Captain?"
"This is Marty."
"She screamed."
"In Michigan."
"First new message."
"Thank you very much, really."
"This is Barbara."
"Two, one, five."
"Here is the door."
"So, this match?"
"I am neutral."
"No cameras."
"Keep the money."
"My favorite place."
"She is a writer."
"I have to disappear."
"You're done."
"Alright, cool."
"You have disappeared."
"Here, listen to this."
"Like a father."
"A hell of a package."
"What are you singing?"
"Most often."
"I'm going to have dinner."
"You will find her."
"No, come here."
"Take up arms."
"To protect yourself."
"Look at his neck."
"Where is Francis?"
"Brain tumor."
"This is Marge."
"Are you talking to each other?"
"Like my wife."
"Just a tip."
"He was telling the truth."
"This is Ned."
"Do this quickly."
"He's looking for us."
"They talk to us."
"Does this happen to you?"
"I will go myself."
"You are adults."
"Remove your hand."
"We all change."
"The perfect woman."
"You should understand."
"Look at yourself now."
"Keep it here."
"Matter of minutes."
"Look at this carefully."
"You were fantastic."
"Yes, my darling."
"Not an accident."
"This is Rory."
"Oh, I love it."
"I am Scottish."
"She will listen to me."
"And the toilets?"
"No kiss?"
"This is Stan."
"You two, come on."
"My real mother."
"And the radio?"
"Two for you."
"She is normal."
"How is Bobby?"
"I helped."
"This is Meredith."
"I am Spartacus."
"People love it."
"Let's all go."
"Me, this way."
"How many guards?"
"Out of gas."
"Go ahead, say it."
"In three hours."
"Nothing in particular."
"It's getting better."
"It was touching."
"On the top floor."
"She is diabetic."
"What's missing?"
"No, you, listen."
"She dreams about it."
"Talk to whom?"
"It is interesting."
"Where is Robbie?"
"It was anonymous."
"This is Al."
"Thank you for stopping by."
"It's narrow."
"I'm Amy."
"I am known."
"Several, in fact."
"God knows how."
"Very well, Your Majesty."
"Play the video."
"I would be outside."
"How was she?"
"Let's play cards."
"Of course, what?"
"Everything is cleaned."
"Let me live."
"Give your position."
"And the watch?"
"Go right."
"She is fabulous."
"One more step."
"Keep moving."
"And the investigation?"
"Only in the morning."
"In my pants."
"He is marked."
"A remarkable woman."
"Put on your hat."
"I want to pay."
"Take off your top."
"Can you call back?"
"Everything was ready."
"We really appreciate it."
"Please remain calm."
"No, I guess."
"My big boy."
"Could you repeat that?"
"Go ahead, old man."
"Less fees."
"And the show?"
"Fill out the form."
"This is Jeremy."
"And the good one?"
"Whoever you want."
"The handsome guy."
"In my cabin."
"Nobody changes."
"I have to go up."
"Yeah, you're welcome."
"Open the hood."
"The other one, now."
"Moving target."
"And your book?"
"You should come by."

"Of course, that's it."
"My only friend."
"Call me Bob."
"A smart little guy."
"I will heal."
"No fans?"
"Back to the wall."
"It changes you."
"Perfect, very good."
"Precautionary measure."
"Did you answer?"
"In the aisle."
"No milk."
"Yes, tell me."
"What are you watching?"
"Where is Connie?"
"I am from?"
"I invented."
"This is Ricky."
"In a taxi."
"And the guns?"
"He is obsessed."
"I was relieved."
"Well, we'll see."
"His grandson."
"We can discuss."
"Dancing?"
"I am connected."
"He got it."
"Find answers."
"Oh, by the way."
"You are elegant."
"What next time?"
"They have to pay."
"In one day?"
"You were perfect."
"They will believe you."
"No deposit."
"More light."
"Call me Jim."
"Raise your leg."
"You have to be careful."
"Get your strength."
"He will find me."
"We see everything."
"We have to get moving."
"It was romantic."
"Not many people."
"Leaving town?"
"Are you crazy?"
"Of course, Captain."
"It should have."
"After the ceremony."
"Go ahead, go."
"Go ahead, leave."
"Where is Marty?"
"It was spectacular."
"I follow her."
"Boss, are you okay?"
"Take them all."
"She was huge."
"Here is my address."
"A great writer."
"I like this."
"No mobile."
"That's better."
"You stare at me."
"Go find him."
"At the latest."
"She is elsewhere."
"He is straight."
"God be with you."
"It terrifies me."
"In this building?"
"Go back to the office."
"Our first kiss."
"She's going home."
"Where is Brick?"
"I am motivated."
"You were busy."
"No more betting."
"And the concert?"
"You start on Monday."
"This is Ari."
"Watch your fingers."
"Can we play?"
"Another wedding."
"You should move."
"They're going out."
"The same guy."
"Move your feet."
"She was old."
"Keep dancing."
"He works a lot."
"Are you getting dressed?"
"My home."
"Right, baby?"
"Look at this baby."
"You know mom."
"May I intervene?"
"They have to go."
"You were young."
"For six months."
"Make it disappear."
"Are you doing nothing?"
"Where is Karl?"
"We'll catch him."
"It's getting heavy."
"Where is Mitch?"
"This is Stefan."
"Tell him now."
"But I could."
"You don't drink?"
"Check your weapons."
"She is sure."
"A little party."
"In this city."
"A single bullet."

"On a boat."
"It was deserved."
"I will miss him."
"Where is Clay?"
"We're going to go in."
"You would like it."
"Here is his picture."
"A German Shepherd."
"Who is what?"
"Hide your joy."
"Here is the entrance."
"How do we get home?"
"We will explain to you."
"In the neck."
"Divide and conquer."
"He is responsible."
"Here is your key."
"Some do."
"Sure, come on."

"Teleportation room."
"I am Jules."
"To live there?"
"Where is Benny?"

"From above."
"Where is Maya?"
"But I drive."

"Your first time?"
"Bottom drawer."
"All my money."
"Where is Gus?"
"Show me how."
"They respect you."
"Where is Scofield?"
"Okay, listen to me."
"Shall we go swimming?"
"Let him play."
"He's going to walk."
"You will be paid."
"Where is Sammy?"
"Me too, son."
"Any other suggestions?"
"Do you want to read?"
"Have you read?"
"Make him wait."
"She canceled."
"Perfect for me."
"All year round."
"We are watching them."
"They are soft."
"But without excess."
"Even very well."
"No manners."
"It's Mac."
"What are they looking for?"
"Very well, why?"
"We'll look for it."
"It's warm."
"More children."
"And the maintenance?"
"She heard."
"He deserves better."
"Take the bus."
"Still here, you?"
"On my own."
"I wanted to try."
"Time for what?"
"They might come back."
"That word again."
"And your studies?"
"No exchange."
"Sorry, uncle."
"I ask for it."
"Where is Walt?"
"I want to sing."
"Hey, my heart."
"I'll create a diversion."
"Do you accept it?"
"Come on, see you soon."
"We're watching her."
"It was unreal."
"And the ammunition?"
"Hey, girls."
"Top drawer."
"And the survivors?"
"What are you asking?"
"Hide here."
"I looked at her."
"Where is Dale?"
"Should I wake him up?"
"She is true."
"No, should I?"
"He would do that?"
"There's better."
"In the ring."
"No more phone."
"What will I do?"
"Where is Casey?"
"You and him?"
"This is Tracy."
"Half a dozen."
"This is Todd."
"And you, son?"
"A true paradise."
"And them too."

"No, he's right."
"It's better not to."
"Where do you think you are?"
"Is this a question?"
"Did I wake you up?"
"I have to find her."
"He's downstairs."
"I love you, darling."
"Okay, here we go."
"Where is the difference?"
"He did that?"
"It will take time."
"That's almost it."
"I asked him."
"You can't understand."
"So that's it?"
"Of course, I understand."
"This is really important."
"It can be arranged."
"That's his thing."
"Who is with you?"
"He will know what to do."
"Answer my question."
"Can you leave us?"
"To tell him what?"
"You'll get used to it."

"Do you have a car?"
"I did everything."
"Is your mother here?"
"Keep that to yourself."
"This is the future."

"What do I gain?"
"He is safe."
"I know this man."
"It's her."
"I'm taking my things."
"I told them."
"It means a lot to me."
"You don't understand?"
"Are you coming to bed?"
"I will find a solution."
"Do you believe in God?"
"You betrayed me."
"Yes, she's fine."
"I waited for you."
"For you, maybe."
"You should do it."
"She wants to talk to you."
"Oh, it's you."
"I am his brother."

"What do I do?"
"That's the main thing."
"You're going to love this."
"Good luck to you."
"This is theft."
"This is his wife."
"You are probably right."
"To all units."
"What have we done?"
"I have a date."
"A glass of wine?"
"You're a genius."
"They took everything."
"She is like that."
"Is that a yes?"
"Get to the point."
"You're quite right."
"You are quite right."
"The door is closed."
"Oh, I get it."
"Where can he be?"
"And you know it."
"Where are the girls?"
"They are children."
"Do you want a cigarette?"
"It depends on you."
"I know this guy."
"It's going to be hard."
"I made it all up."
"We have an agreement."
"I've experienced that."
"This is business."
"It's really beautiful."
"I want to stay here."
"Take me with you."
"What is she doing there?"
"Let's start at the beginning."
"It's so romantic."
"Don't tell him."
"I want one."
"It's very rare."
"Can you prove it?"
"Do you know his name?"
"He is so cute."
"That's my idea."
"Yes, yes, of course."
"Do this for me."
"Can I kiss you?"
"I am a genius."
"You will have wanted it."
"You heard her."
"A glass of water?"
"He attacked me."
"I'll take note of that."
"I could do it."
"I love you all."
"This is our home."
"I like it here."
"Is this your daughter?"
"I wrote it."
"We have to find him."
"I have plans."
"It's our anniversary."
"What is your job?"
"He is a hero."
"We have a lead."
"That was all that was missing."
"He must be there."
"We found her."
"You have to tell him."
"You tricked me."
"Where are you at?"
"He knows something."
"I have children."
"There you go, that's good."
"Remember this."
"It's going to be fun."
"You must be right."
"I want my share."
"Take care of her."
"You may withdraw."
"I don't say anything."
"I am with him."
"It's your decision."
"I know him well."
"Where is the boss?"
"Is it that obvious?"
"As fast as possible."
"It's business."
"You need to calm down."
"I have a name."
"I feel something."
"Yes, that's it."
"We can work it out."
"This is the protocol."
"Have a good night."
"It's been a while."
"We are with you."
"I've seen better."
"Who found it?"
"May the best man win."
"He's in there."
"I grew up here."
"You heard right."
"I was almost there."
"You promised me."
"Do you want to talk to him?"
"I'm going with you."
"Go get the car."
"Give me a hug."
"I love this movie."
"I love you, man."
"Do you have a phone?"
"It's a tradition."
"They are all the same."
"He was my brother."
"It goes without saying."
"You just arrived."
"Where is my bag?"
"They are with me."
"It's from me."
"Like last time."
"Tell me about him."
"Let's get started."
"I see someone."
"Let's not stay here."
"She has nothing."
"Well, well."
"Can I talk to him?"
"Let me go for a bit."
"I come in peace."
"You want my opinion?"
"I've arranged everything."
"Goodbye, my love."
"Thank you for waiting."
"Why is he here?"
"Where is your mom?"
"I wanted to see you."
"Enough about me."
"How charming."
"My place is here."
"No, it's you."
"All this for what?"
"But everything is fine."
"We have time."
"Please leave a message."
"Once or twice."
"I have more."
"Something interesting?"
"This is the market."
"I feel responsible."
"Thank you for doing this."
"OK, I understand."
"I'm in a meeting."
"I heard her."
"A little bit."
"Try to relax."
"It's good here."
"So, is that it?"
"I am her husband."
"How romantic."
"Give me a kiss."
"You have five minutes."
"They must be stopped."
"I am."
"They won't come."
"How is your leg?"
"It's written there."
"Come to my office."
"I am your son."
"You are very kind."
"It's really amazing."
"You are a man."
"How touching."
"I want to end it."
"Is this your husband?"
"Tell me more."
"I followed him."
"And where is he?"
"It's much better."
"But who is it?"
"Thank you for the tea."
"And I will."
"She is safe."
"I need to rest."
"We kissed."
"Would you like some tea?"
"She was my wife."
"Some coffee?"
"You can keep it."
"Did you see me?"
"This is his house."
"The door opens."
"You make me laugh."
"We'll find something."
"When did you arrive?"
"But I'm fine."
"We have a plan."
"Not that way."
"This is his mother."
"The hearing is adjourned."
"Is it that important?"
"Is this an interrogation?"
"Did you tell them?"
"Take care of that."
"It's almost midnight."
"I have a migraine."
"This is my patient."
"He is very sick."
"You have to get used to it."
"Did you call him?"
"Can we see it?"
"Did you understand correctly?"
"It's a bluff."
"I'm still here."
"Just a little bit."
"It's very nice."
"I bet not."
"I already knew that."
"But who are you?"
"They are yours."
"Who said it?"
"I thought you were gone."
"I'm going now."
"Do you have his address?"
"He needs it."
"It's the past."
"We slept together."
"What are you working on?"
"But it will be okay."
"I have to concentrate."
"You asked me?"
"If it is possible."
"What more can I say?"
"Thanks for asking."
"Make love to me."
"I accept your apology."
"Go ahead, do it."
"I was looking for you everywhere."
"I bought it."
"She said it."
"Who's coming with me?"
"You should see this."
"Of course, my dear."
"You get used to it."
"I am on duty."
"Tell me one thing."
"You have a gift."
"It's very romantic."
"This is the signal."
"I fought."
"This is our secret."
"The honor is yours."
"I'll take you there."
"Do you want a sandwich?"
"Where is my family?"
"He likes me."
"So, how was it?"
"They are mine."
"It's my responsibility."
"He is a thief."
"I'm just curious."
"I would like to meet him."
"He's up there."
"Do you want to hear it?"
"Get on your knees."
"It's very close."
"Not as much as you."
"It's a chance."
"That was the goal."
"Thanks for the ride."
"I'm thinking of you."
"I'll call them."
"Because of me?"
"But thank you anyway."
"But on one condition."
"Promise me one thing."
"Good luck, guys."
"It's so good."
"Yes, you know it."
"I'll find her."
"It was very beautiful."
"Thanks for trying."
"And I love it."
"What would you like to drink?"
"What are your plans?"
"Yet it is true."
"That's done."
"But it happened."
"What do you call that?"
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
"The situation has changed."
"Thank you for your visit."
"I am leaving in the evening."
"Where is he from?"
"Who is your friend?"
"The police are here."
"Yes, it's over."
"She's a witch."
"Yes, he's fine."
"The night brings counsel."
"Not just a little."
"She needs it."
"But I love him."
"You are a hero."
"Shall we race?"
"Who should I announce?"
"I have my sources."
"One thing is certain."
"You have one hour."
"I am very happy."
"Let's go, guys."
"Give me the money."
"The subject is closed."
"It's his."
"It's for him."
"I know the truth."
"What was I thinking?"
"It's almost there."
"Oh, thank God."
"I love him so much."
"What kind of stuff?"
"It works for me."
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
"I take my coat."
"She just left."
"Where is the catch?"
"I have proof."
"Nobody is."
"I'll talk to him about it."
"Am I scaring you?"
"He's coming with us."
"Because of you."
"I called her."
"Stay tuned."
"What happened to her?"
"Good night everyone."
"This is your home."
"I love you, baby."
"He is ours."
"Do as you wish."
"That was the plan."
"What did you learn?"
"If God wills."
"Where did he come from?"
"How is your father?"
"I promised him."
"I am his daughter."
"Where are they now?"
"Nothing for the moment."
"It's very exciting."
"The meal is ready."
"She tells the truth."
"It's Latin."
"He said why?"
"Do you have one?"
"Can you forgive me?"
"Is this your house?"
"It doesn't respond."
"There are no more."
"Yes, I know her."
"I know that name."
"Thank you for the flowers."
"I would have liked to."
"Speaking of the wolf."
"You are a sweetheart."
"I'm sure of it."
"Be on time."
"I was held back."
"I have a call."
"You are my daughter."
"That's the word."
"What is the question?"
"I'm going to rest."
"What did you answer?"
"How is your arm?"
"I have the situation under control."
"Can I try it?"
"I have questions."
"Where are my things?"
"I'm going to see her."
"That's true, yes."
"What is your secret?"
"It's a theory."
"Who is the victim?"
"So who is it?"
"Do you have a card?"
"I call my lawyer."
"It's been years."
"They don't answer."
"How is the family?"
"I bet you do."
"Can you hear yourself talking?"
"I don't dance."
"Thank you all."
"I feel nauseous."
"I had one."
"I am speechless."
"I am a scientist."
"Yes, I noticed."
"This is his son."
"Thank you, everyone."
"So it's true?"
"I invited him."
"And who are you?"
"We are in America."
"I took it."
"I see very well."
"Oh, you know what?"
"Where is your wife?"
"I want to hear it."
"The sun rises."
"Can you believe that?"
"Where is the chest?"
"You can talk to me."
"I still do."
"It's his car."
"What is this here?"
"It's family."
"I'll catch you."
"I ask the questions."
"Yes, if you want."
"Have a good evening."
"You can have it."
"I know enough."
"Will you excuse me?"
"That's how it was."
"Sure, go ahead."
"It was a surprise."
"I am in position."
"Have you been there?"
"I am your husband."
"Let me do it."
"I'll come get you."
"It's a deal."
"I have connections."
"What's yours?"
"It was my decision."
"Women first."
"And he left."
"Goodbye, my friend."
"That's new."
"We have some questions."
"You are my father."
"It's almost ready."
"Don't think about it."
"Go ahead, guys."
"You will be safe."
"He is at home."
"They found us."
"But not this time."
"I'm early."
"Okay, I'll go."
"I found you."
"She just arrived."
"What are the chances?"
"You know very well."
"I think it's great."
"We're going together."
"That's probably it."
"Is this the truth?"
"She's still there."
"They took it."
"It had to be said."
"They are animals."
"And for what reason?"
"I have to tell him."
"Mom, where are you?"
"You're going to get it."
"Just once."
"Do you think you're smart?"
"They all look the same."
"This is heavy stuff."
"You are very handsome."
"They are still there."
"Do you know him well?"
"I would have done the same."
"I want a name."
"I won it."
"It's still warm."
"This is his father."
"We'll talk about it again tomorrow."
"What is the word?"
"I have a girlfriend."
"I'm right, right?"
"But yes, you can."
"I am the boss."
"Thank you for lunch."
"They are back."
"Your mother is right."
"Yes, it's done."
"How interesting."
"Just in case what?"
"Give us a minute."
"Why are you interested?"
"No, it's different."
"It must be me."
"No, I swear."
"I'm proud of it."
"I don't play anymore."
"We're going to get it."
"That's true, right?"
"Can I accompany you?"
"I am a girl."
"What is the verdict?"
"A friend of yours?"
"May I know why?"
"Are you talking about me?"
"The password?"
"Have you met him?"
"How do we do that?"
"I have a solution."
"I love this guy."
"It's my right."
"We must find him."
"I'll make sure of it."
"Get rid of him."
"How many do you want?"
"I have the address."
"You, come with me."
"I'll open it."
"So how are you?"
"So, how are you?"
"Let me think about it."
"This is quite normal."
"It was a compliment."
"She called me."
"More and more."
"Welcome to the neighborhood."
"How's your head?"
"He is on his way."
"Yes, yes, I know."
"Do you want to go there?"
"It's so quiet."
"I'm going to marry her."
"Who is the girl?"
"I learned that."
"Wait a little longer."
"Let's hope it works."
"When was that?"
"Shall we make peace?"
"All right, guys."
"Yeah, that's him."
"It's a code."
"How can I be sure?"
"Nobody came."
"It's a message."
"He just came out."
"It's very funny."
"It's really delicious."
"You are my hero."
"Yes, he is here."
"It's all you."
"I already have it."
"Where are my glasses?"
"This is how it works."
"No, she's right."
"This place is awesome."
"God rest his soul."
"I love it too."
"It's between us."
"Do you know anything about it?"
"She's already gone."
"Don't talk to him."
"Who are you then?"
"No, he's fine."
"I woke up."
"Where should I go?"
"For the last time."
"Oh, that's cute."
"This is the opportunity."
"It fits you well."
"What is the address?"
"She said yes."
"Thank you for meeting me."
"I prefer to stand."
"He is an artist."
"I want to be part of it."
"It's very cute."
"And here is the work."
"May God keep you."
"Where is the map?"
"Will you calm down?"
"That remains to be seen."
"I will always be there."
"As you please."
"Neither seen nor known."
"I heard them."
"He's the boss."
"It was something."
"Where is your mother?"
"Nobody believes me."
"I was late."
"God bless America."
"We found this."
"All this for nothing."
"This is the right one."
"There are some everywhere."
"They will be here soon."
"Yes, that would be good."
"You have time."
"It's a chameleon."
"What was the question?"
"Tell me your name."
"It suits you well."
"The line is cut."
"What are your orders?"
"Let's go get some fresh air."
"Not good at all."
"How did you feel?"
"I have a child."
"She is very kind."
"He is very intelligent."
"She's his daughter."
"Is that right?"
"You are all the same."
"Yes, I assure you."
"I am grateful to you."
"Is this really necessary?"
"It's always like that."
"I love surprises."
"It's morning."
"Do you want to see them?"
"She kissed me."
"I see things."
"The car is here."
"I watch TV."
"It's a machine."
"I'll see you soon."
"Do you know how to do that?"
"I can see that."
"He is very strong."
"Let's play a game."
"Thanks for the beer."
"Are you having a drink?"
"We finally meet."
"I'm fine now."
"How do you explain it?"
"You found me."
"It's so exciting."
"You could have called."
"I mean, yes."
"Yes, it looks like it."
"And that's good."
"What is your first name?"
"It's not pretty."
"I want an answer."
"Give me a name."
"The end of the world."
"I'm fine, really."
"No, it's great."
"He's your friend."
"I have two children."
"He will be here soon."
"It's your destiny."
"You have a family."
"We have one."
"But that's good."
"She's a beauty."
"I can show you."
"This place is amazing."
"So where is she?"
"The world has changed."
"I'm talking about you."
"A little further."
"I am one."
"You asked for it."
"Thank you for your time."
"Can I help you?"
"Do you want to go back?"
"He spoke to me."
"It's super good."
"She's not breathing."
"In a way, yes."
"But it is necessary."
"She's not breathing anymore."
"You are so pretty."
"Is this an invitation?"
"In the other direction."
"We can always try."
"It's completely different."
"You know the rest."
"It's his life."
"He's an imposter."
"I can call you?"
"Do you want to talk to me?"
"I'll tell them."
"I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
"Where is the captain?"
"Thank you both."
"Need anything else?"
"I would like a room."
"The coffee is ready."
"We'll see each other again soon."
"It's already better."
"That's very nice."
"Who was this man?"
"They are over there."
"I'm going to freshen up."
"It should be good."
"Here's another one."
"There, that's better."
"I have something else."
"Do you believe me now?"
"Los Angeles Police Department."
"I am like you."
"I really want it."
"Did you know him well?"
"Oh yes, of course."
"Do you like music?"
"It's the same for me."
"You are still young."
"No, thank you."
"Yeah, I get it."
"Is he with you?"
"No, it's him."
"Not to this extent."
"No, you're right."
"Yes, for now."
"Did you do that?"
"And that's it."
"Where is your father?"
"When did you get back?"
"What would you have done?"
"Am I interrupting something?"
"She's upstairs."
"There is better."
"I want to know."
"It's going to be good."
"It's very different."
"With all my heart."
"And the other two?"
"Do you want some wine?"
"What was that again?"
"It comes down to the same thing."
"I am the father."
"Where is she from?"
"Good luck to all."
"For now, yes."
"Nothing is true."
"Tell them the truth."
"What did it give?"
"I'm on a mission."
"Do you really want it?"
"Thank you for your hospitality."
"She's my cousin."
"He scores a point."
"I'm right here."
"Go back to your room."
"Actually, yes."
"Yes, that's clear."
"You already know that."
"Come near me."
"Did you say that?"
"I am the king."
"Yes, it was."
"No trace of him."
"It was for you."
"I'll never get there."
"Who hired you?"
"The situation is serious."
"She's back."
"She is with us."
"Can we talk to you?"
"This is my apartment."
"And what about you?"
"It remains to be seen."
"What is the program?"
"The meeting is open."
"We have to find her."
"I fainted."
"It's a shortcut."
"This is so unfair."
"I have to get back to work."
"I can't breathe."
"Where is my sister?"
"A little music?"
"Where are you now?"
"We're live."
"I just understood."
"What's the score?"
"It's the custom."
"How we meet again."
"There, that's good."
"It's straight ahead."
"It's going to be okay, darling."
"That's me."
"It's right here."
"I like this idea."
"Don't even try."
"This is an opportunity."
"Yes, roughly."
"Is it that serious?"
"It's wonderful, isn't it?"
"I owe you."
"It's a love."
"You need it."
"Where are you taking us?"
"A little seriousness."
"I want to apologize."
"I am safe."
"What does he look like?"
"Do you come here often?"
"I just started."
"Are you taking anything?"
"Who said that?"
"Hey, where are you going?"
"If you can say so."
"They got it."
"I wouldn't dare."
"He came here."
"Can I see you?"
"I'll come back for you."
"I have the solution."
"What are the orders?"
"She is late."
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen."
"Your table is ready."
"So everything is fine."
"Is this from you?"
"I was at home."
"He's his brother."
"Not for me, thank you."
"You can do better."
"He is very talented."
"The bar is closed."
"Make room."
"It's a choice."
"This is my nephew."
"I am a private detective."
"It's been forever."
"A little lower."
"Do you still love me?"
"I have a suggestion."
"I have it here."
"I think not."
"I miss her so much."
"Are you in charge of it?"
"It's his idea."
"Take me home."
"Pour me a drink."
"I'm going to find her."
"Where is the child?"
"How would you know?"
"She's a kid."
"You can leave now."
"Guess who it is?"
"I love you, son."
"I will pray for you."
"Come home."
"Nobody knows anything."
"It's a movie."
"Shall we have a drink?"
"We have to talk."
"How did he get in?"
"You are like me."
"She is very good."
"This is my uncle."
"May God forgive me."
"I have homework."
"Are you going to call him?"
"It's a hospital."
"But it's different."
"Why do you think that?"
"They don't exist."
"They are for you."
"This is my chance."
"I come from the future."
"We'll see you tomorrow."
"It was his choice."
"No sign of him."
"You understood me."
"Yes, who is it?"
"How are things going?"
"I'll take one."
"Do you have the keys?"
"Hey, you know what?"
"This is who I am."
"Don't make any noise."
"Yes, I hear you."
"Yes, it is necessary."
"It's looking good."
"Are you local?"
"We're all going."
"I'm downstairs."
"I know so."
"Too late for what?"
"Can you do it?"
"I wanted to do it."
"I want to talk to them."
"You should be happy."
"Do you have a daughter?"
"I'm very hungry."
"I'll let you work."
"We'll talk about it tomorrow."
"How old were you?"
"She's downstairs."
"And besides that?"
"Stuff like that."
"It's all thought out."
"That's good too."
"That's just as well."
"Do you have a family?"
"He is so kind."
"Come back whenever you want."
"Give me your keys."
"What kind of market?"
"And you were right."
"I'm going back to bed."
"Everyone to your posts."
"You don't answer?"
"I checked everything."
"It was mine."
"The police will arrive."
"He looked for it."
"Is that your name?"
"We start from scratch."
"I know you well."
"This isn't going to work."
"That was the idea."
"I forgot about it."
"I have a secret."
"Tell him yourself."
"Where is the dog?"
"Right, guys?"
"Thank you, that's nice."
"This is my phone."
"You have talent."
"We'll see about that tomorrow."
"He woke up."
"It must be hard."
"It's a riddle."
"But what's the point?"
"I am his son."
"Did you see this?"
"What is the goal?"
"I still love him."
"And I was right."
"I can understand that."
"You should sit down."
"I learned a lot."
"If you want."
"Hold on to me."
"And everything will be fine."
"I have a lead."
"I have already given."
"This is my case."
"I was called."
"This is our destiny."
"Is this the case?"
"She said why?"
"When did it start?"
"He is really good."
"No matter the price."
"We all have them."
"I'm on call."
"I drink to that."
"Do you have someone?"
"I was saying that to myself too."
"You have just arrived."
"I'll take that one."
"What are they talking about?"
"It suits me."
"What kind of business?"
"How do you do that?"
"It will be fine like this."
"No, you were right."
"She's on her way."
"Yeah, I see that."
"It's a job."
"She scares me."
"What, is that all?"
"One day you will understand."
"It's been a year."
"He was a friend."
"Relax a little."
"Where are the boys?"
"Where is my phone?"
"Something to say?"
"Can we sit down?"
"I have a wife."
"We have a mission."
"I can't breathe anymore."
"We discussed it."
"I said it all."
"How old was she?"
"How are you going to do it?"
"We found them."
"She's my niece."
"Did I do well?"
"Hey, what's up?"
"They are the best."
"But you are right."
"I know things."
"This is my boy."
"Stay on your guard."
"You must leave now."
"You have to leave now."
"Where is my mom?"
"Can I open it?"
"Where are my children?"
"I wanted to protect you."
"I like being here."
"There are some."
"Maybe both."
"I know where to go."
"So, is it good?"
"Did you call her?"
"Is your father here?"
"Excuse us for a moment."
"I'll take it off."
"He works for me."
"You owe me."
"And what do you do?"
"Do you have a room?"
"I ask to see."
"She's good, huh?"
"You have a call."
"Where are my clothes?"
"I have his address."
"The account is there."
"You can take it."
"You look good together."
"I'm retiring."
"I already am."
"He is for me."
"You know the rule."
"The road is closed."
"The visits are over."
"And you are right."
"Do you want to have fun?"
"A year and a half."
"I am over the moon."
"He's a psychopath."
"He's a guy."
"Do you have your papers?"
"Yeah, for sure."
"It's quite far."
"They don't understand."
"She's your sister."
"I'm staying with you."
"Can you do this?"
"I have three."
"This is America."
"He's a vampire."
"Return to your posts."
"It's your money."
"Do we have a choice?"
"I'm going to town."
"A friend of mine."
"Calm down, guys."
"That's all him."
"I forgot everything."
"He is one of us."
"What does that rhyme with?"
"It will be with pleasure."
"No, that's for sure."
"It's obvious."
"Can I take this?"
"She was so beautiful."
"She was right there."
"Give me one."
"This is so true."
"Are you going on a trip?"
"There's nothing better."
"I have a life."
"You go home."
"Ask your mother."
"It is well known."
"You want to know what?"
"It's work."
"Can I know why?"
"I sold it."
"Did this really happen?"
"Are you asking me?"
"I accept your apologies."
"I'm happy to."
"From time to time."
"You can't know."
"Goodbye, my darling."
"That's your thing."
"You don't trust me?"
"It will stay between us."
"Shall we take a tour?"
"That was very kind."
"He's coming this way."
"I have my idea."
"Don't you want some?"
"Lean on me."
"I'll pass it to you."
"Do you want an ice cream?"
"Do you want to kiss me?"
"He was my son."
"I love this city."
"She's my fiancée."
"May I ask why?"
"Do you have the key?"
"This complicates things."
"I understood it."
"So, it's settled."
"How is your hand?"
"Nobody knows him."
"I prefer to stay here."
"How do you spell it?"
"Nothing, everything is fine."
"I only have that."
"That's it."
"No, she's fine."
"He is very close."
"Good night, guys."
"We form a team."
"Do you still love him?"
"Where are the people?"
"I want to meet him."
"No, he's gone."
"We must find her."
"Who is this person?"
"They are already here."
"She looks like my mother."
"Where does he come from?"
"Give me the address."
"It was a woman."
"Sir, are you all right?"
"Did you follow me?"
"I have the right."
"What's your secret?"
"What is the answer?"
"Do you want to see me?"
"You always do that."
"I know one thing."
"I'm on duty."
"You must not."
"You have my number."
"Driving licence and registration document."
"Well, let's go."
"I'm so excited."
"What did he look like?"
"It's over, right?"
"I'll fix this."
"He is in a meeting."
"We saw it."
"Do you recognize this man?"
"Call me later."
"Come inside."
"Welcome to the team."
"Are you from here?"
"And you believe it?"
"Can I be honest?"
"She's in there."
"Am I dreaming or what?"
"It's pretty good."
"Gift from home."
"The meeting is over."
"Good night, my darling."
"I've been watching you."
"You're my brother."
"That could be nice."
"This is a new one."
"It's a wedding."
"I wanted to ask you."
"I stay with him."
"The car is ready."
"It's his decision."
"You can stay here."
"I have responsibilities."
"Yes, it was good."
"You won't go."
"But for what purpose?"
"You have no idea."
"What do you want to drink?"
"I followed you."
"I just want to know."
"We are still here."
"They saw us."
"Because of that."
"We come in peace."
"It is possible, yes."
"Ask your father."
"Do you have any plans?"
"I'm waiting for your call."
"Sorry about last night."
"Oh, that's nice."
"But he's right."
"And he was right."
"I want to marry him."
"Yeah, that's cool."
"That's very true."
"What is the target?"
"How do I do that?"
"You know me well."
"Look out the window."
"I live next door."
"You are one of us."
"Do you want a candy?"
"These are my children."
"We have orders."
"Are you going to talk to him?"
"Let me understand correctly."
"Are your parents here?"
"It's your business."
"Thanks for your patience."
"I like this song."
"Do you have any ideas?"
"She is very sick."
"That's my plan."
"Does that mean yes?"
"You are so kind."
"I would have done it."
"I got you."
"He's a pro."
"Thank you for coming back."
"It's coming."
"He is a soldier."
"Do it for me."
"I have the impression."
"Does that remind you of anything?"
"How is the little one?"
"But where is she?"
"I am very impressed."
"Because of what?"
"I see you coming."
"It was very pleasant."
"Look where we are."
"What is the number?"
"To do what there?"
"For good reason."
"Take a closer look."
"Oh, that's perfect."
"I know a shortcut."
"He saw everything."
"I don't work."
"Where is the remote control?"
"To tell them what?"
"Everything's fine, Mom."
"Tell him to leave."
"It's past midnight."
"Very kind of you."
"This is the girl."
"Thank you for your understanding."
"Now it's over."
"But at what cost?"
"Do you still have it?"
"It was the last one."
"Where are you hiding?"
"Where is his mother?"
"That's our thing."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"I am the Doctor."
"How convenient."
"I'm going there."
"I'll take a taxi."
"Tell me about her."
"This is a good one."
"How much will that cost?"
"I'll call again later."
"It's ours."
"She is ours."
"How are you, old man?"
"That's settled."
"Life is unfair."
"It's for tomorrow."
"Remind me your name?"
"It's brand new."
"These are his words."
"But it's important."
"You don't feel anything?"
"That's my motto."
"I know her well."
"It's his right."
"Don't let me down."
"They are very close."
"They all say that."
"Would you like anything else?"
"I touched it."
"This is my mission."
"Do you have a lead?"
"I obey orders."
"I'll introduce you."
"Okay, you know what?"
"By all means."
"Yes, a little bit."
"Where is your sister?"
"She scores a point."
"It's really pretty."
"It's the FBI."
"You must be proud."
"It all depends on you."
"I have my car."
"When did you come back?"
"But where are you going?"
"She is very talented."
"One of these days."
"It's night."
"Okay, everyone."
"You don't say anything?"
"Yes, all the time."
"He is on vacation."
"What are they doing there?"
"And who else?"
"Where does he work?"
"Where is the exit?"
"She's still here."
"I was born here."
"What are their names?"
"It's an experience."
"Thank you for your welcome."
"I remember now."
"I'm coming to see you."
"I'm a guy."
"I know that too."
"When you're ready."
"You are very good."
"How many do you have?"
"Where is your son?"
"Are you with us?"
"The class is over."
"He'll get there."
"Such is the world."
"This could be fun."
"I'm getting out of here."
"Go back inside."
"It was my dream."
"Always the same story."
"Where is that?"
"Did you take it?"
"I'll bring it to you."
"Who's stopping you?"
"You should come and see."
"It's your imagination."
"He can do it."
"It's written here."
"It's next door."
"I have three children."
"Do you have a cell phone?"
"Give me a smile."
"Go get some fresh air."
"My mother was right."
"At least, not yet."
"Good luck for tomorrow."
"It no longer exists."
"Do you have any cigarettes?"
"How do I feel?"
"The circle is complete."
"I like your style."
"This is our son."
"I will miss her."
"It's a cover."
"I called them."
"I heard screaming."
"It was to be expected."
"It must be important."
"I really messed up."
"We're going to get them."
"We're celebrating."
"He is early."
"Anything to add?"
"Something is eluding me."
"Do you see this guy?"
"This is my dad."
"I have a message."
"Goodbye, girls."
"You are so cute."
"Goodbye, children."
"We have a chance."
"They had a fight."
"They are behind us."
"We have a guest."
"We are very close."
"Can I borrow it?"
"I have the key."
"It's a person."
"It's not surprising."
"Maybe one day."
"I've been busy."
"You are my mother."
"You get the idea."
"I just learned."
"Your reputation precedes you."
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"I'll send it to you."
"Do you really love him?"
"Where is my hat?"
"It's the wind."
"I can say that."
"Will you give it to me?"
"Yes, it's there."
"Where is your boyfriend?"
"Your father is right."
"Well, I hope."
"Who wants a drink?"
"Do you have a match?"
"This is my dog."
"Do you get along well?"
"Be on your guard."
"We all do it."
"Do you hear anything?"
"Yeah, everything's fine."
"Do you have the phone?"
"They found it."
"I'm behind you."
"I trusted him."
"Am I clear enough?"
"I have pictures."
"I'll warn him."
"This is our baby."
"Who are the others?"
"A cup of coffee?"
"She's my patient."
"You got me."
"I am leaving in the morning."
"Yes, I will be there."
"No need to thank me."
"What have you got there?"
"Get ready to dive."
"It's more important."
"I have to train."
"I am his lawyer."
"Talk to me about what?"
"Is that your plan?"
"This is really unfair."
"Are you his wife?"
"It's a bird."
"Keep your eyes closed."
"You still are."
"Give him time."
"Where is the kid?"
"I noticed it."
"And he's right."
"Could I talk to you?"
"Are you talking about that?"
"We are at home."
"He comes to his senses."
"I can explain it."
"Take care of them."
"My life is over."
"Yes, I was."
"Where is your family?"
"It's an antique."
"It will please him."
"This is my gift."
"We are ahead of schedule."
"You are a woman."
"Who is your father?"
"You're not sleeping?"
"Like mother, like daughter."
"Try to remember."
"Can I stay here?"
"Who is the boss?"
"Tell him to come."
"I can fix this."
"I am very touched."
"It's nice here."
"Do you think that's normal?"
"Who is with him?"
"Things are going to change."
"Good, that's good."
"This happens to me often."
"Take another one."
"It was something else."
"His condition is stable."
"Are you his father?"
"In another life."
"I like women."
"Do you have an address?"
"Where do I start?"
"This is a hypothesis."
"Are you going to do it?"
"He has a plan."
"He is very cute."
"I'm taking the car."
"I was with him."
"This is our job."
"Go ahead, take it."
"I know these people."
"Are you going to listen to me?"
"Love at first sight."
"She did that?"
"I didn't notice."
"Get her out of here."
"He is a spy."
"I owe him everything."
"It will be easier."
"I cut myself."
"Yes, that's for sure."
"Like this, like that."
"I have a reservation."
"It was my choice."
"What effect does it have?"
"Can I hold it?"
"In a good way."
"You're going to be awesome."
"We have just started."
"It's a bar."
"I read that."
"This place is beautiful."
"Yeah, that's for sure."
"You've come at the right time."
"Thank you, that will be all."
"I love my job."
"Do you have anything else?"
"Come sit here."
"But I know you."
"We are all here."
"I've waited long enough."
"He's a drug dealer."
"This is my partner."
"You're going to get better."
"She is very intelligent."
"Get straight to the point."
"Would you like some coffee?"
"How do we get there?"
"That is good."
"It's a map."
"We are the best."
"A day or two."
"Is that your answer?"
"This is the beginning."
"What kind of car?"
"And where is she?"
"No one knows."
"And what about the money?"
"We were talking about you."
"I have feelings."
"Have you seen me?"
"I'm coming to get the news."
"I have your word?"
"Do I have your word?"
"Calm down a little."
"Are you the owner?"
"What kind of questions?"
"She must be there."
"Mom, I love you."
"Once and for all."
"He is online."
"Excuse me, guys."
"Yes, I have them."
"I appreciate the gesture."
"Did you kiss him?"
"I will come to see you."
"Nobody loves you."
"No, it was me."
"It's still me."
"That's already good."
"The wedding is canceled."
"No, I have it."
"It's very strong."
"Yes, that suits me."
"I'm on leave."
"It's a date."
"What does your father do?"
"I want an explanation."
"He always does that."
"Show me your papers."
"This is super cool."
"Where is your friend?"
"Where are my parents?"
"Did you have fun?"
"Can you understand that?"
"I see the type."
"But it is possible."
"An hour or two."
"He was a man."
"What was he doing here?"
"We are on our way."
"You have guts."
"Where are the bodies?"
"The hearing is open."
"This is genius."
"It wasn't far."
"This should be interesting."
"That's your opinion."
"She needs to rest."
"Yes, I was there."
"You are my family."
"Yes, it's here."
"No, I didn't know."
"And I like it."
"Not at all, sir."
"You should think about it."
"I trained."
"You have two minutes."
"Keep us posted."
"What is your number?"
"It's a book."
"The decision is made."
"He is our friend."
"I had my reasons."
"Nailed it."
"They are very beautiful."
"Do you know this woman?"
"There is interest."
"How is it going?"
"I'm looking for something."
"I'm looking for my son."
"I was just there."
"We should talk about this."
"I like you very much."
"He looks like my father."
"Nobody likes me."
"I'm a pro."
"You should be careful."
"I read the newspapers."
"I come here often."
"I have a picture."
"It was a piece of cake."
"Mom, are you there?"
"And for what purpose?"
"Where is the little one?"
"I was told."
"The door is locked."
"What does this have to do with us?"
"You know the drill."
"And that means?"
"I was going to get to that."
"Some tea?"
"It goes back a long way."
"You are forgetting one thing."
"How did it start?"
"My time has come."
"Are you going to marry him?"
"And for the others?"
"Did he talk to you?"
"What kind of job?"
"This is your family."
"I'll go talk to him."
"We have a winner."
"We're good here."
"I loved him so much."
"Can we talk to him?"
"It's a gem."
"Ah, you're here."
"You have a visitor."
"I know, me too."
"I'm on a diet."
"It's your right."
"You're going to like this."
"Tell me his name."
"It was war."
"Are you sleeping with him?"
"He hanged himself."
"I am the director."
"No, I'm staying here."
"How dare he?"
"Do you have his number?"
"Who is it then?"
"Put on speakerphone."
"I've already started."
"It's the only one."
"This is the only one."
"You agreed."
"I'm looking for you everywhere."
"Are you coming or what?"
"I would like to go there."
"Nobody wants it."
"She's getting married."
"You fainted."
"She's our daughter."
"And that's normal."
"All right, that's enough."
"It never happens."
"Get me the police."
"They are very good."
"I have several."
"How do you know him?"
"So that was it."
"And where is it?"
"I'm going to kiss you."
"I followed her."
"We can discuss it."
"It's his turn."
"Don't be sorry."
"You should tell him."
"That's the principle."
"Yes, we are."
"This is my cell phone."
"I'll give it back to you."
"I will be late."
"I see, I see."
"I'm really looking forward to it."
"I just moved in."
"You have to relax."
"Why did you do it?"
"How is life?"
"It must be her."
"I'm going to the bar."
"You have to stay here."
"The bathroom."
"Dad, is that you?"
"Who's in there?"
"There's reason to."
"He was with me."
"You have to accept it."
"That's the price."
"The plan has changed."
"I came to apologize."
"A little water?"
"I turned it off."
"It's a memory."
"I know one."
"I noted it."
"I was talking about you."
"I'm so hungry."
"No, don't say anything."
"And what do we do?"
"How is your shoulder?"
"It is our duty."
"I have to get dressed."
"He said yes."
"It's so pretty."
"Go in the car."
"So how was it?"
"He saw us."
"Goodbye, guys."
"I miss you a lot."
"I almost have it."
"I like children."
"It's been a week."
"There is no one there."
"He needs to rest."
"Each one of them."
"Yes you are."
"As much as you want."
"I am a vampire."
"I love my husband."
"Did you believe it?"
"How is your son?"
"Do you have a son?"
"The hearing is suspended."
"Think of something else."
"It was destiny."
"We got married."
"So where are we going?"
"The one and only."
"Go back up on both sides."
"I hear voices."
"Nothing is certain."
"It will have to be done."
"It's still hot."
"Are you his mother?"
"It's nature."
"Are you going to eat that?"
"Not just any one."
"I'm going to the office."
"No, it's too much."
"I have my period."
"Goodbye and thank you."
"They're coming this way."
"Look who it is."
"I have a license."
"Can I think about it?"
"You are at my house."
"I can't stand it."
"I believe in you."
"He is a professional."
"Don't ask questions."
"I hope to see you again."
"Keep your cool."
"For the moment, yes."
"I am a federal agent."
"It's going to be dark."
"It's simple though."
"I have a mission."
"Much more than that."
"I close the door."
"Yes, it is important."
"It's so simple."
"I'm on guard."
"What can he do?"
"He is so handsome."
"I finally understood."
"I have a boyfriend."
"Shall we walk a little?"
"Do you want to meet him?"
"Go inside."
"Where is mine?"
"I should know."
"Where are we going to go?"
"She doesn't understand."
"It never happened."
"Beginner's luck."
"See you on Monday."
"I spoke to them."
"I'm leaving town."
"I can fix everything."
"In the name of what?"
"I am his friend."
"Are you from the FBI?"
"Give me your number."
"She agrees."
"You two, with me."
"This is our song."
"What do you want to eat?"
"How do you explain that?"
"How many are left?"
"She drowned."
"I like to hear that."
"It would be with pleasure."
"She's a fighter."
"Who is the target?"
"It will be very good."
"This is going to be interesting."
"Did someone ring you?"
"For nothing in the world."
"It must be here."
"It's that simple."
"They are pros."
"Do you want a hug?"
"I know the story."
"I need them."
"She saw everything."
"Do you want to get married?"
"She is one of us."
"No, what is it?"
"I have someone."
"I'm at work."
"It is now."
"It's our turn."
"How could I have?"
"This is my secret."
"It's going to be okay now."
"The war has begun."
"That's a good point."
"It's me, Mom."
"Who are you with?"
"As what?"
"I will take care of it."
"That is my intention."
"The water is good."
"It's a win-win."
"You are making progress."
"Are we going somewhere?"
"Do you want to stay here?"
"She should be there."
"Do you think like me?"
"He should be here."
"Is your husband here?"
"Good for them."
"Do you recognize anyone?"
"But I will."
"This is how we do it."
"I have a witness."
"It's very tempting."
"That's correct, sir."
"It's a rental."
"It's the same everywhere."
"Goodbye, sweetie."
"I'm in the process."
"It's a picture."
"She's coming with us."
"We need to talk to you."
"It's for her."
"But where are you?"
"You are all here."
"That's where it comes from."
"What's up, old man?"
"How is your family?"
"Who can say?"
"Something is brewing."
"I know that voice."
"These are mine."
"Now we're even."
"Mom, is that you?"
"It will be better tomorrow."
"Glad to see you again."
"Did you read that?"
"Everything is fine, thank you."
"All this for me?"
"And here is the result."
"They will love you."
"This is his specialty."
"Go ahead, tell me."
"There it is."
"There, it's said."
"I was doing my job."
"That's my role."
"This is the baby."
"You have to be patient."
"Please let me know."
"We'll talk soon."
"It's a detail."
"Don't call me anymore."
"I have to call him."
"I have to go out."
"Try to calm down."
"Who were you talking to?"
"How is your mother?"
"Did he touch you?"
"You should be."
"No bad words."
"He apologized."
"Do I know him?"
"So, how is it?"
"The offer still stands."
"I'll find something else."
"They are downstairs."
"What kind of accident?"
"I have his number."
"I'll pick you up."
"I miss her too."
"No, out of the question."
"It's a prototype."
"Who are you really?"
"He's a customer."
"Do you smell something?"
"Isn't he cute?"
"I have mine."
"I found nothing."
"This is my territory."
"Where am I from?"
"How much do you need?"
"Nobody likes that."
"Absolutely correct."
"That's very clever."
"I'm making an effort."
"I got married."
"This is my city."
"Stay inside."
"It has already started."
"It's hot, huh?"
"Did you know her well?"
"I kissed her."
"I love my country."
"I still have it."
"The moment of truth."
"You're going to have fun."
"You already are."
"No, I'm done."
"Do you know this girl?"
"You are my husband."
"The cops are here."
"There is one left."
"As good as possible."
"It will never change."
"Do you have any papers?"
"Still no response."
"What is the secret?"
"I take my jacket."
"They take care of it."
"Let's go have some coffee."
"Where are they all?"
"I have visions."
"No more than that."
"Who is this boy?"
"We need to."
"No, he's out."
"You stay with me."
"You'll love this."
"I have a brother."
"Give me something."
"I'm getting some fresh air."
"It's very delicate."
"My mother is here."
"What were we talking about?"
"What is the message?"
"Who wrote it?"
"He is a gentleman."
"It was for me."
"All that for that?"
"How did they know?"
"How is my wife?"
"Did you page me?"
"Yeah, I heard."
"I'll hold them back."
"We have a witness."
"I can do anything."
"Where is the commander?"
"It's almost finished."
"Nobody goes there."
"Have you talked about it?"
"I have a scoop."
"Have you had enough?"
"It's me, sir."
"What is the price?"
"Don't say it."
"A table for two."
"I looked for you."
"There is that."
"This is the hospital."
"He has connections."
"And the good news?"
"It's well done."
"I can call him."
"I love this country."
"My father was right."
"I wanted to warn you."
"Anyway, thank you."
"Have you seen everything?"
"Can they do that?"
"Should I call a doctor?"
"I must apologize."
"I was talking about myself."
"It's a cat."
"I want it too."
"I paid for it."
"And what does that give?"
"But where are we?"
"I would like to meet her."
"It's the holidays."
"She wants to see you."
"This should be easy."
"I will watch over you."
"Is your mom here?"
"I stopped him."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"Where are they taking him?"
"I signed up."
"I keep my promises."
"It works very well."
"Are they still there?"
"We had a great time."
"It's your baby."
"Shall we have a coffee?"
"Twice a day."
"They always do."
"Go ahead, go ahead."
"See you later, guys."
"Where is the world going?"
"It's your night."
"It has to be done."
"I'll show him."
"Return to your post."
"I gave it to him."
"It helps me a lot."
"It's Friday night."
"You are in good shape."
"Thank you, it's good."
"I thought I understood."
"Not thanks to you."
"Something for me?"
"That was our agreement."
"He trusts me."
"I will examine you."
"But that's going to change."
"May God protect you."
"I wanted to be sure."
"Thank you for helping us."
"No, I'm here."
"What are your intentions?"
"No one is innocent."
"I have the results."
"I take my bag."
"I know women."
"I'll keep it."
"I'll stay here."
"If you would like."
"He is somewhere."
"She's going to do it."
"And it's you."
"It's a toy."
"She's up there."
"Yes, it was him."
"I have to admit it."
"It was well played."
"The show must go on."
"She is in the bathroom."
"This is news."
"I'll meet you outside."
"I want a baby."
"There, it's better."
"Very well, goodbye."
"Do you want a soda?"
"Does he have a record?"
"It's going to be huge."
"It's a war."
"How is your brother?"
"Are you the father?"
"You have good taste."
"It's still there."
"The back door."
"I'll be downstairs."
"This is my fiancé."
"I have a visual."
"It's faster."
"The hunt is open."
"We made it."
"You know the answer."
"I could do that."
"They just left."
"Do you want a cookie?"
"We'll show them."
"I took the oath."
"He took it."
"That will be all, thank you."
"And what was it?"
"I am a witch."
"One of them."
"I will do it again."
"We found him."
"I am a hero."
"And who is it?"
"I'm going around."
"Remember me."
"From ancient history."
"My wife is pregnant."
"She can do it."
"Where are we going now?"
"You are the only one."
"Do you do this often?"
"Yes, it's you."
"We have to do."
"I will heal you."
"She is an artist."
"To that extent?"
"It was the best."
"She left us."
"They are right there."
"No, don't go."
"I would like to hear it."
"I have a friend."
"He's coming with me."
"I would be happy."
"No more than you."
"It might well be."
"Listen, everyone."
"No, not that one."
"Whose is it?"
"He is in the toilet."
"He has his account."
"And what do you want?"
"But I'm hungry."
"The money is there."
"It's Saturday night."
"It's an investment."
"It was an honor."
"Who is the other one?"
"I work for him."
"He needs to be intubated."
"We'll finish later."
"Did you find them?"
"He's your husband."
"And all the others?"
"I grew up there."
"I should go back."
"What's your excuse?"
"But you were right."
"It depends on the day."
"I have a lot of them."
"Two million dollars."
"Who takes care of it?"
"I organized everything."
"Your time has come."
"She didn't want to."
"Your mother called."
"This is my number."
"This is that guy."
"Where is the emergency?"
"Where are the reinforcements?"
"You work for me."
"How is the patient?"
"You should do the same."
"Where did she come from?"
"You and me, together."
"Is this really true?"
"Have you eaten yet?"
"She likes me."
"Where were you born?"
"Where is his father?"
"I'm watching over you."
"I close my eyes."
"It's probably him."
"For both of them."
"I have everything prepared."
"So, what do you want?"
"She's no longer there."
"Money first."
"It's very common."
"So, it's decided."
"You swear to me?"
"I'll find out."
"It was very nice."
"I should have guessed."
"Do you want to follow me?"
"No, I will."
"I'm next door."
"The incident is closed."
"We should do it."
"Signs of life?"
"I want that one."
"As far as i know."
"It's so hot."
"That's well said."
"Yes, I like it."
"Yes, thank you."
"It's a medicine."
"A door opens."
"This is a guess."
"I owe him that."
"She knows something."
"I sent it."
"So, here we go."
"Let's go, let's go."
"A little calm."
"On whose orders?"
"It's pretty here."
"You're not coming in?"
"I defended myself."
"Until tonight."
"I miss him a lot."
"No means no."
"Hi how are you?"
"Well, it depends."
"I will be with you."
"Keep your head up."
"To do what with it?"
"Tell us the truth."
"Where is your bag?"
"Do you know the way?"
"Did you just get back?"
"Do you feel ready?"
"You know the procedure."
"She was your mother."
"I was like you."
"I feel dizzy."
"And that's fine with me."
"How old was he?"
"Who did this?"
"Come have a drink."
"She was kidnapped."
"I will accompany you."
"He's my partner."
"Yeah, I saw it."
"Don't drink too much."
"This is your dream."
"He is coming towards us."
"I'm talking about that."
"We'll meet outside."
"But you are here."
"Give me your cell phone."
"Everything must be perfect."
"The police called."
"It was really good."
"Do you know someone?"
"I know you, don't I?"
"I have clients."
"It was really great."
"I know how to manage."
"This is a clue."
"The discussion is closed."
"Sorry, I forgot."
"I'm cleaning."
"This is my domain."
"She is so cute."
"There's a chance."
"Don't approach him."
"I really like you."
"It's very touching."
"If only I could."
"Can you describe it?"
"You're so cute."
"Where are my manners?"
"I know the rules."
"I'll take two."
"You didn't do anything."
"The train is about to leave."
"Do you really love me?"
"Try to rest."
"Lunch is ready."
"In front of everyone?"
"Is this your dog?"
"Do you read the Bible?"
"Where are my friends?"
"There are plenty of them."
"I'm going to be a dad."
"This is her husband."
"Prepare to leave."
"We need to talk about it."
"She is really beautiful."
"It's been two weeks."
"I'm pissed off."
"Where are the guards?"
"Not far from here."
"Don't be a wimp."
"Goodbye, my son."
"I'll see you there."
"Do you have his name?"
"What did you eat?"
"It's your life."
"Let me kiss you."
"Get rid of her."
"I'll go check."
"He's pretty cute."
"How did she do it?"
"I like challenges."
"What have you decided?"
"It had to be done."
"I'll need it."
"That was his name."
"How do you know me?"
"She still is."
"I love this woman."
"Don't play that game."
"When will I see you again?"
"What does the doctor say?"
"Give me a reason."
"Did you want something?"
"Are you on vacation?"
"What kind of thing?"
"Is this your room?"
"But maybe not."
"Did you kiss her?"
"I'm busy right now."
"We got along well."
"It's a plan."
"Do you want a medal?"
"A little bit anyway."
"I believe in him."
"Top left."
"I'll pay you back."
"But I loved him."
"Does she have a name?"
"I have a hunch."
"Where do I put it?"
"Have you been waiting for a long time?"
"This is your dad."
"The doctor is here."
"No, he's here."
"It's his job."
"Can I touch it?"
"Neither now nor ever."
"I should thank you."
"You do nothing."
"Are we going swimming?"
"Can I keep this?"
"I would like to see her."
"I'm fine here."
"I would."
"Sorry about your dad."
"It's very successful."
"Late for what?"
"I want to keep it."
"Anyone in particular?"
"Oh, you're right."
"He is a foreigner."
"He is next door."
"She tastes good."
"She was very beautiful."
"I want to be there."
"Do you know where to go?"
"Give me a hint."
"Look on the bright side."
"We have news."
"Is this your boyfriend?"
"The door is there."
"It's the heat."
"I don't exist."
"You have to live well."
"You are very quiet."
"You will listen to me."
"Someone like me?"
"I have an alibi."
"I was born there."
"It's a marvel."
"And one more thing."
"It's the habit."
"I think it's cute."
"I'm very close."
"I don't do that."
"A gift for you."
"Did she talk to you?"
"They are late."
"Do you know her well?"
"We live in a democracy."
"Just ask."
"My car is here."
"They just arrived."
"Did you invite him?"
"Yeah, I got it."
"I wanted to talk to him."
"This way, guys."
"Go ahead, tell him."
"So who are you?"
"It was good, wasn't it?"
"It's simpler."
"What is his condition?"
"For money?"
"It's a decoy."
"Is that possible?"
"I'm perfectly fine."
"Where are my shoes?"
"Thank you, Your Honour."
"This is my team."
"There are so many of them."
"You forgot that."
"Give me that phone."
"That would be nice, wouldn't it?"
"It's very far away."
"It will take a second."
"I invited her."
"Thank you for your trust."
"Am I late?"
"No, none of that."
"Go yourself."
"But he left."
"Wait in the car."
"She took it."
"But yes, of course."
"Where is the book?"
"We're coming with you."
"That was the deal."
"They need it."
"At least, I think so."
"You know what, man?"
"Everyone wins."
"Would you like a coffee?"
"What's up, doctor?"
"They are not here."
"Yeah, that's awesome."
"I have faith."
"They spotted us."
"It's very possible."
"You're not leaving?"
"I owe it to him."
"I know music."
"I left him."
"Do you have a photo?"
"No, I would be surprised."
"Do you have the tickets?"
"I am myself."
"It could be me."
"They should be there."
"I have a client."
"How are we going to do it?"
"Are you passing through?"
"We've seen it all."
"But I understood."
"Is anyone hungry?"
"I owe him a lot."
"My life is here."
"I'm willing to try."
"He always does."
"Let's get him out of here."
"Who is your boss?"
"This is your mom."
"He kissed me."
"I know a way."
"You're not staying?"
"Are you going to see her again?"
"Such is life."
"What's the story?"
"It's right there."
"An hour and a half."
"Go do your homework."
"I know my son."
"I'm taking a bath."
"That's him there."
"Do you like it here?"
"They said that?"
"It's very hot."
"What does it consist of?"
"It's against nature."
"Go get your things."
"Is that clear enough?"
"We'll call him."
"Good night, children."
"Are you going to see him again?"
"I know the answer."
"Is she with you?"
"Come on, one more time."
"Have confidence in yourself."
"How could this be possible?"
"I have information."
"Where do we meet?"
"Have you spoken to them?"
"It seemed fine to me."
"Don't be embarrassed."
"What is he playing at?"
"Give me your coat."
"We have to stay together."
"Where is the door?"
"How do you know each other?"
"That's cool, man."
"Surprised to see me?"
"Nina speaking."
"I'm always right."
"She is so pretty."
"Can I leave now?"
"For the first time."
"The night will be long."
"Don't go there."
"I want to have fun."
"I don't drink anymore."
"How is my baby?"
"I have a class."
"You can be."
"I'm doing you a favor."
"I stay with her."
"How is work going?"
"They're coming for you."
"And everything else."
"To what extent?"
"She's fine, thank you."
"It must be true."
"Your place is here."
"What are my chances?"
"It's been two days."
"This is what happens."
"I'm upstairs."
"You have to concentrate."
"We have a deal."
"Not until now."
"Take good care of it."
"It's a habit."
"Where did it come from?"
"Where is my watch?"
"One point for you."
"We have a connection."
"I want to redeem myself."
"Is anyone receiving me?"
"Is this a proposal?"
"She will be here soon."
"How long did it last?"
"He was a hero."
"It'll be fine, thanks."
"Can you see me?"
"Where is your dad?"
"A pack of cigarettes."
"But everything will be fine."
"She has character."
"I really hope so."
"Are you almost finished?"
"I'll be next door."
"These are my orders."
"She trusts me."
"I want them all."
"Let's take a look at this."
"This is the office."
"Leave us a message."
"I misheard."
"Give me a moment."
"He is at my house."
"I was too."
"What were you going to say?"
"I'm going back."
"No, she's gone."
"No, it's important."
"Do you have a name?"
"Wiggle your big toe."
"It's a wig."
"He's a smart guy."
"Does that make you happy?"
"Never say that."
"He is the king."
"I've already been here."
"Who was this woman?"
"He is in town."
"You can count on it."
"I have a request."
"Are we going to my house?"
"Where is the boat?"
"We'll talk to him."
"You are very talented."
"What if he comes back?"
"I had everything planned."
"We are among friends."
"I want to be free."
"This is my bed."
"Someone spoke."
"Who wants some cake?"
"See you later then."
"I am his sister."
"My offer still stands."
"It's been two years."
"She's coming with me."
"I want a child."
"Where is this girl?"
"Go back to your seat."
"Left, right, left, right."
"This is my neighbor."
"I will give them back to you."
"It was a boy."
"You are my life."
"They are safe."
"It was an order."
"Get into position."
"So I will."
"It starts like this."
"Who will be next?"
"Who doesn't love it?"
"I won again."
"I don't know yet."
"I lived it."
"He helped me."
"Let's get to the facts."
"I always do this."
"It must be good."
"I know them all."
"We fought."
"Everything seems in order."
"God does not exist."
"And he knows it."
"It's an obsession."
"Are you all ready?"
"I have witnesses."
"Are you coming or not?"
"I'd like some."
"You are forgetting something."
"Yeah, you know what?"
"Will you come with me?"
"Are you my mom?"
"I am an American citizen."
"It matters to me."
"The rules are simple."
"Who do we have here?"
"I have to take this."
"Who took it?"
"When will we see each other again?"
"That's class."
"I'll take the bet."
"Tell me a story."
"I have to be honest."
"I chose you."
"I was going home."
"I like music."
"I love music."
"Less than a minute."
"She comes to."
"Yes, I believe you."
"How was the trip?"
"Yes, I believe it."
"I love my family."
"A little closer."
"Yes, we have it."
"Give me five minutes."
"Do you understand English?"
"Where is the helicopter?"
"Who did what?"
"It's a story."
"I'm so happy."
"It will do the trick."
"It's a nickname."
"I am with them."
"Who are these people?"
"They are your friends."
"Where is my dog?"
"We know each other well."
"He has talent."
"Could I talk to him?"
"You know I do."
"That's my theory."
"He will arrive soon."
"I am a gentleman."
"It's his signature."
"They broke up."
"And when was that?"
"We have a case."
"It's different now."
"You don't have any?"
"It was so cool."
"I'll give it a try."
"I owe you a lot."
"I can feel her."
"Thank you for last night."
"I'll let you do it."
"No, I'll be fine, thank you."
"I earn my living."
"I looked for it."
"I have to know."
"Very well, my dear."
"I'll wear it."
"Speak after the beep."
"That's good, kid."
"Do you want a piece?"
"Is this coffee?"
"This is awesome, man."
"It can be."
"I repeat to you."
"But you know that."
"I will find the money."
"I take the wheel."
"As I said."
"She stopped."
"Show me your hand."
"I learned it."
"It's spring."
"They are like us."
"I will follow him."
"He turns around."
"He's a human."
"Yes, he was."
"We're done here."
"Are we going to the cinema?"
"It's a certainty."
"How is your head?"
"Let it last."
"After all these years."
"I have contacts."
"That's clear."
"Watch where you step."
"I liked it a lot."
"Good for me."
"She won't say anything."
"It's really cute."
"I'll go see him."
"Your last name?"
"And the other half?"
"Is this a challenge?"
"It's a rule."
"That's their job."
"That kind of stuff."
"I think I know why."
"I have to finish this."
"Give me the bag."
"These are fakes."
"Who sent it?"
"Did you get married?"
"Where is the police?"
"How is the girl?"
"That's probably true."
"Who is first?"
"Where do I put them?"
"Make good use of it."
"Give me two minutes."
"That's the spirit."
"How do you know her?"
"I am your sister."
"Give me back my money."
"You arrive on time."
"You should read it."
"You are my sister."
"No thanks, I'll be fine."
"I'm from here."
"Is this an order?"
"In previous episodes."
"One of your friends?"
"She was with me."
"You don't think so."
"I hid it."
"We're the good guys."
"Face it."
"He was very kind."
"Do you want proof?"
"That's all there is."
"When did she leave?"
"How do we know?"
"It's hers."
"This is my man."
"It's very convenient."
"How is your sister?"
"Tell him goodbye."
"She's hiding something."
"And that's me."
"You are under oath."
"Let me sort this out."
"I've already left."
"Shall we call the police?"
"It's age."
"This is so awesome."
"Keep it to yourself."
"Let's go, come on."
"You betrayed us."
"It's a robot."
"Never two without three."
"Ask him yourself."
"And she's right."
"Do you want a drawing?"
"You are very strong."
"I want his name."
"You have to wake up."
"But where are they?"
"This is unprecedented."
"I am a spy."
"He must be here."
"I want to see you."
"I'll keep it simple."
"You surprised me."
"You won it."
"What is your price?"
"He is with them."
"Let's go to the hospital."
"Is that me?"
"Come take a look."
"It's going to be okay, Mom."
"It's up there."
"I'll show you around."
"I was ten years old."
"Is he safe?"
"Let me handle this."
"Yes, we know that."
"She was strangled."
"The rules have changed."
"Isn't that you?"
"It was a girl."
"This is a record."
"Where did it happen?"
"Thanks for the information."
"What number is this?"
"I was there before."
"We should go see."
"I like people."
"I have the keys."
"This is my ex."
"I really loved him."
"Do you see this man?"
"He was a genius."
"Move over a bit."
"Meet you there."
"We'll find them."
"She's pretty, isn't she?"
"Is this a dream?"
"Oh, that's it."
"Can I get up?"
"What does your husband do?"
"There's nothing left."
"You have mail."
"Are we allowed?"
"I want to make up for it."
"No, I want to know."
"It's an option."
"What is it exactly?"
"Yes, both of them."
"You are his mother."
"This way for the change."
"Give us a moment."
"He left us."
"As I thought."
"It's beautiful here."
"I will guide you."
"I'll be at the bar."
"Where is your daughter?"
"I still am."
"Nobody says that."
"I will carry you."
"This is my department."
"Where are you going to go?"
"What kind of information?"
"Is it still long?"
"Give me a beer."
"I will drive you."
"Where is his room?"
"I've never tried."
"I know people."
"I'm going to class."
"I don't drive."
"I have a mandate."
"Someone has to pay."
"How did he know?"
"I love you more."
"Yes, it's nice."
"You should have called."
"Do you live around here?"
"It's very small."
"You have to get up."
"I'm looking for a friend."
"I care about it a lot."
"Who needs it?"
"Is this your signature?"
"I will explain later."
"It will soon be dark."
"That's a lot to ask."
"The visit is over."
"Long life and prosperity."
"Do you want to do that?"
"It was very interesting."
"It's just hot air."
"This is his writing."
"She knows too much."
"You are my friends."
"You called me."
"Sorry, it's closed."
"We already know that."
"It's more prudent."
"No, I have to go home."
"I'll catch it."
"Shall we play a game?"
"I can always try."
"I love this game."
"Are you here already?"
"Worldwide."
"That's good, darling."
"Nobody wants that."
"That's true, sir."
"But you are."
"I'm better now."
"I had to see you."
"Will you dance with me?"
"Just a moment, just a moment."
"How are you, honey?"
"Do you have a toilet?"
"Are you thinking about me?"
"I accept the challenge."
"But she left."
"Maybe for you."
"How are the others?"
"He was stabbed."
"His last name?"
"It must be them."
"Where can she be?"
"Everything was going well."
"What does it taste like?"
"No, you know what?"
"Is it your birthday?"
"This is the car."
"Is this place taken?"
"Any friends of yours?"
"How are you, son?"
"My name is Jarod."
"It starts to rain."
"I see it now."
"He was kidnapped."
"Why do you ask that?"
"No need to apologize."
"The call of duty."
"Did you look at yourself?"
"You're a sweetheart."
"I'm talking about myself."
"It's so sudden."
"I kissed him."
"You are hiding something."
"That was my intention."
"How is it done?"
"A hundred years have passed."
"I'll clean this up."
"Didn't have time."
"I owe you everything."
"This is our mission."
"I am your boss."
"Protect me from what?"
"We have to leave now."
"It could be him."
"The window is open."
"You would have done the same."
"And it happened."
"Did you find it easily?"
"I love this car."
"He is on the ground."
"It's great here."
"I should talk to him."
"And I know why."
"You have a son."
"What is his story?"
"But I like it."
"But it's great."
"I already love him."
"You helped me."
"You are very brave."
"I oppose it."
"You're changing the subject."
"You're my friend."
"Nobody has any."
"You are a girl."
"It's by birth."
"I'll take the orders."
"It was the truth."
"He surrendered."
"I take command."
"I love this job."
"Somewhere around there."
"I dreamed of you."
"Yes, she is here."
"When will he come back?"
"No thanks to you."
"Where is your master?"
"Dad, can you hear me?"
"I'll do without it."
"A letter for you."
"Thank you for accepting."
"The matter is settled."
"That's good, keep going."
"Where do I put this?"
"I hear things."
"Let me see her."
"I helped you."
"Where is it at?"
"Yes, she was."
"Is there any coffee left?"
"We have to find them."
"Can I withdraw?"
"Come live with me."
"Everything has an end."
"But I forgive you."
"I have a signal."
"I've been waiting for this moment."
"What is needed."
"I understand, I understand."
"Do you have a wife?"
"I made it."
"He is so small."
"The count is correct."
"They got me."
"It's an adventure."
"The front door."
"And I loved him."
"I'm still hungry."
"We have to see each other."
"And for the rest?"
"He wants to marry me."
"You are always right."
"The answer is simple."
"He is traveling."
"I'm in good shape."
"It suits him well."
"It's like new."
"It's very curious."
"To everyone."
"Hence my presence."
"It's a reflex."
"Not for a while."
"And who am I?"
"He's used to it."
"You have ten minutes."
"What do you work in?"
"The kitchen is closed."
"Well, you know what?"
"Can you see it?"
"It's my nature."
"It's an impression."
"I await your reply."
"Is it the money?"
"At sunset."
"He saw me."
"This is quite important."
"This is really interesting."
"Hal, do you read me?"
"A message for you."
"No, that's nice."
"It's a real one."
"Do you want war?"
"Near the window."
"Yes, right now."
"This is an advantage."
"Thank you for this evening."
"Is this your mother?"
"It's your idea."
"When did he leave?"
"What if I win?"
"It's very heavy."
"I have been watching you."
"I'll show them."
"You are very intelligent."
"You look beautiful."
"She saw it."
"It's a gamble."
"Line up."
"He wants to see me."
"They all do it."
"But yes, but yes."
"Where are you calling from?"
"Yes, it's me."
"Haven't you noticed?"
"Can you stand up?"
"We do it together."
"It will be without me."
"How does it open?"
"How did they do it?"
"I was hot."
"Something big."
"Do we have a name?"
"Yes, I know that."
"Not in this case."
"Have you seen him again?"
"No, I know."
"The police came."
"It's down there."
"Where is the list?"
"What is your situation?"
"It's pretty cool."
"I am with her."
"You are a soldier."
"Where should I sign?"
"It was his."
"How did you get out?"
"How are you, brother?"
"You are so handsome."
"Do you have a child?"
"That means no."
"Do you have a license?"
"I have eyes."
"She doesn't speak."
"Thank you for the support."
"This is the solution."
"I am the owner."
"And these two?"
"They are monsters."
"We were almost there."
"You are a star."
"You are here now."
"Is this your friend?"
"It was my job."
"You have your orders."
"I listened to him."
"I have some too."
"There are two left."
"We'll be there soon."
"That would have surprised me."
"It's our business."
"Thank you for staying."
"What is your address?"
"Have you watched it?"
"Where is the tape?"
"I'll warm you up."
"Do you want some too?"
"Do you play sports?"
"It will be an honor."
"I am the captain."
"What is the code?"
"Oh, I'm fine."
"A little faster."
"How long has this been going on?"
"You are his father."
"Where is our son?"
"He wanted to talk to you."
"Let me talk to them."
"When do we see each other?"
"People are looking at us."
"No, it's normal."
"There, that's me."
"What was it then?"
"It was really nice."
"Back to normal."
"How could I know?"
"I understood that."
"Stick around."
"I think it's cool."
"He has his reasons."
"Thank you and goodbye."
"I'm fine, Dad."
"You are capable of it."
"I know a guy."
"I kept my word."
"Let me tell you."
"I found her."
"I get up early."
"It's really cool."
"He was so kind."
"He betrayed us."
"He was like that."
"We had fun."
"We want to talk to you."
"What does she look like?"
"I know this girl."
"I'm almost ready."
"I was assaulted."
"We're going to be rich."
"What do you want to hear?"
"I want to thank you."
"Ah, that's good."
"Let there be light."
"It was a secret."
"I have a key."
"You have to believe it."
"I know you."
"Where is the drug?"
"Let me fix this."
"Take off his handcuffs."
"How did it work?"
"Mom wants to talk to you."
"How's work going?"
"It's chocolate."
"It was one."
"I wanted to call you."
"Are you watching TV?"
"He's a fighter."
"Did you call them?"
"I am one of you."
"They are people."
"End of conversation."
"I believe so, yes."
"It comes from me."
"It's summer."
"I am in mourning."
"Can we keep it?"
"You say that now."
"Really, I'm fine."
"It's my party."
"Sorry, everyone."
"I have my orders."
"But he's fine."
"He is a witness."
"The situation is delicate."
"I have an address."
"Of course, with pleasure."
"Are you letting him go?"
"Thank you for the call."
"He's up to something."
"Thank you for accompanying me."
"Do you have the address?"
"No need to talk about it."
"It is your duty."
"You're doing it right."
"Nobody comes here."
"Will you remember it?"
"I was going to bed."
"Excuse me, who are you?"
"He just called."
"I can feel them."
"It's been an hour."
"Is this your plan?"
"I'll walk you home."
"This is very cool."
"I can teach you."
"No, far from it."
"What are our options?"
"It must be buried."
"It's a loan."
"I'm waiting for a response."
"No, don't move."
"I didn't look."
"Let's get going."
"We have a contract."
"I am in place."
"Well, thank you very much."
"I have to see them."
"You have to say it."
"Where is the old man?"
"First door on the left."
"I'm going back to the office."
"It's me."
"Can I keep them?"
"Can he do that?"
"We must warn them."
"Have you identified it?"
"And he disappeared."
"Yes, it shows."
"Attention, everyone."
"What is your opinion?"
"I can do it again."
"This is the father."
"Do you have a brother?"
"That says it all."
"First come, first served."
"Are you a friend?"
"Your identity card."
"He's a good-looking guy."
"This is the place."
"You know the music."
"You can't read?"
"It's a treat."
"He is very attractive."
"You didn't have to."
"But it's me."
"Welcome to the party."
"Tony, it's me."
"It's okay, baby."
"Who wants coffee?"
"What is your offer?"
"If you wish."
"Who did you see?"
"He is very sensitive."
"Want to try it?"
"She has talent."
"You're forgetting something."
"She saw me."
"See you outside."
"Where are your shoes?"
"I'm at the office."
"Give me your opinion."
"I love this stuff."
"This is that girl."
"You're going to be fine."
"Someone came in."
"Back off, everyone."
"You will know soon."
"Don't call him."
"Do you want some milk?"
"Did you buy it?"
"The session is over."
"They are going to get married."
"Yes, it's him."
"It's your wedding."
"Come dance with me."
"They are so cute."
"Can you talk to him?"
"We have a call."
"I am now."
"Nobody does that."
"I will do what is necessary."
"Serves him right."
"He had planned everything."
"When is the wedding?"
"This is progress."
"I want children."
"Now what do we do?"
"I will find the way out."
"Are you sleeping with her?"
"Can I tell him?"
"Do you have any leads?"
"Please exit the vehicle."
"The tea is ready."
"You will find something."
"I don't accept."
"Merry Christmas everyone."
"Twice a week."
"I open the door."
"Do you want to take it?"
"Who is this gentleman?"
"I will watch over him."
"Let's lay our cards on the table."
"Yes, I will tell him."
"Where are my pants?"
"Do you have a dog?"
"It's very personal."
"There are three left."
"And you guys?"
"Do not judge me."
"I have a patient."
"She had to leave."
"Who is your source?"
"I'm really fine."
"We do our job."
"What more can be done?"
"Give me time."
"Yes, maybe so."
"That's the whole story."
"Yes, it's beautiful."
"You'll pay for it."
"That's perfect, thank you."
"Like what, for example?"
"What remains?"
"As soon as I can."
"I worked late."
"I came to see you."
"Do you have coffee?"
"Do you think this is normal?"
"This is my wedding."
"I have the answer."
"We're among ourselves."
"Did I have a choice?"
"Sorry for my delay."
"Was it really necessary?"
"He kept his word."
"I know the type."
"I love my life."
"Did you touch it?"
"My father is here."
"Let's go eat something."
"You must be strong."
"It will be a pleasure."
"How can this be?"
"Up the stairs."
"She got me."
"Where are my men?"
"Yes, that makes sense."
"Let me accompany you."
"You owe me this."
"Let me take this."
"It was a coincidence."
"Have you been good?"
"It's a success."
"A little to the left."
"She was his wife."
"She was like that."
"Are we going to your place?"
"What exactly do you do?"
"A lot of things."
"I accept your offer."
"Sir, can you hear me?"
"Do you want to marry him?"
"Be nice to her."
"Is this your family?"
"You should relax."
"He was poisoned."
"Thanks, anyway."
"No, you stay here."
"It's emotion."
"How was your trip?"
"I'm trying to think."
"I had to do."
"You two stay here."
"I'll go first."
"My name is Ben."
"You are really beautiful."
"You are truly beautiful."
"I should do it."
"He makes me laugh."
"That's enough, guys."
"I had fun."
"We need more."
"It's a mess."
"I am his uncle."
"I can defend myself."
"I knew it well."
"I'm here, Mom."
"Not in this way."
"That would be very kind."
"Can you feel it?"
"We are men."
"Have you been here before?"
"I would like to see them."
"Can anyone confirm?"
"She is so young."
"This is my offer."
"He confessed everything."
"How is my son?"
"This is a solution."
"Do you believe in destiny?"
"This is my client."
"Good night, my love."
"I'll tell you again."
"I have my pride."
"You're hiding something."
"It will take a minute."
"No, it's serious."
"I would have known."
"It must be."
"And where are you going?"
"How are the girls?"
"Do you already know each other?"
"My wife is waiting for me."
"Did you go there?"
"Yeah, it is."
"Footsteps."
"It will go faster."
"I'll check that out."
"Someone will come."
"It's the cops."
"Lean forward."
"Great work, guys."
"My God, are you okay?"
"No one will see it."
"You all know that."
"Yes, I see her."
"Have you read this?"
"It's our money."
"Where is his body?"
"Everything was going so well."
"Yes, I'm done."
"Do you think it's good?"
"No, I don't agree."
"But it's cool."
"I must have been dreaming."
"Come back in an hour."
"This is justice."
"He will hear you."
"Sorry to wake you up."
"Guys, guys."
"I want to see him again."
"You know that perfectly well."
"She will know what to do."
"She's a pro."
"I know the law."
"Where are your friends?"
"That must be nice."
"Yes, everything is ready."
"Thank you for your kindness."
"She is too good."
"What are we playing?"
"Get her out of there."
"But he was there."
"What are our chances?"
"But I have changed."
"Come, I beg you."
"Will you give me some?"
"Do you want chicken?"
"They called me."
"I like girls."
"Are you planning to stay for a long time?"
"Are these your children?"
"What do you call him?"
"I'll eat later."
"Where is the bag?"
"I've been better."
"I liked you."
"Give him the money."
"Where is he now?"
"Be honest with me."
"She has guts."
"I love this moment."
"Where is your room?"
"I want to meet her."
"Who's up there?"
"When I'm done."
"I want details."
"I am a thief."
"We've had enough."
"I'm on edge."
"It's a contract."
"Do me this favor."
"I think so, yes."
"This is my taxi."
"Glad to be here."
"It's the phone."
"Everything has a price."
"I met her."
"Where is the rock?"
"Now it's done."
"It's quiet here."
"Nowhere in particular."
"Good luck, buddy."
"Another time, then."
"Do you have your passport?"
"I will go on foot."
"I'm all in."
"And tell him what?"
"Oh, he's here."
"You can always dream."
"May God protect us."
"It was very brave."
"Ask yourself the question."
"I sincerely hope so."
"See you soon, I hope."
"I was in the bathroom."
"I bought them."
"Is everything okay, madam?"
"She has something."
"No, I think so."
"But it worked."
"Something to eat?"
"That's a paycheck."
"I brought it back."
"Where is the letter?"
"Can you replace me?"
"Dad is back."
"Give me an example."
"We meet here."
"Yeah, sort of."
"It's a race."
"I live across the street."
"Everything's fine then."
"Do you see this girl?"
"Don't you have anything better?"
"Who invited him?"
"We're going to question him."
"They will arrive soon."
"Until further notice."
"Get in the truck."
"No, let me do it."
"It was a game."
"Where is his office?"
"Do you want the money?"
"But time is running out."
"I wanted to surprise you."
"Return to base."
"And what does it do?"
"I am a person."
"I was just wondering."
"She's coming this way."
"What's the weather like?"
"He has an alibi."
"He's right here."
"Get to work."
"We'll do without it."
"I must warn you."
"It can't be."
"I am his fiancée."
"What is your verdict?"
"It was a miracle."
"He loves you very much."
"We have to tell him."
"My name is Hank."
"You're an angel."
"Do you have proof?"
"It's an event."
"Can you take me?"
"How are things here?"
"Do you smell that?"
"He saw it."
"Because I don't."
"She woke up."
"It's a poem."
"I want to accompany you."
"It's an airplane."
"Don't you believe?"
"Don't tell them anything."
"Welcome to Los Angeles."
"Oh, not at all."
"Would you have a cigarette?"
"It's adrenaline."
"We'll have to wait."
"She was my friend."
"Did you feel that?"
"I'll try it."
"You are part of it."
"They are very kind."
"They stopped."
"Where are you planning to go?"
"He's your cousin."
"Can you call me back?"
"He's holding up."
"I'm waiting for that."
"You said no."
"So, is it yes?"
"How are you, boy?"
"What is your profession?"
"It was a metaphor."
"He's a friend."
"I am resting."
"It's going to be cool."
"I will come back for you."
"I can hear you breathing."
"Are you a parent?"
"Oh, that's wonderful."
"It's totally different."
"You can do anything."
"Where is the food?"
"Do you want to hold it?"
"I'm doing research."
"History repeats itself."
"He is a god."
"I have two daughters."
"It's been three days."
"It looks like this."
"He trapped us."
"I got them."
"Do you have luggage?"
"And on your side?"
"No, it was good."
"What is your goal?"
"She came here."
"Ah, here we are."
"I love this passage."
"He goes home."
"I'm going up there."
"I accepted it."
"His days are numbered."
"Let's go have a coffee."
"Like every night, Minus."
"I know that perfectly well."
"We must work together."
"He will be here tomorrow."
"You were able to come."
"I love weddings."
"Where is my lawyer?"
"I'm talking about us."
"Sue me."
"As you feel."
"Maybe you should."
"We love you too."
"Where are your things?"
"Don't call me."
"Is it really him?"
"It was the police."
"You can relax."
"But that's normal."
"No, that's correct."
"I have to join him."
"It was one less."
"What do they want from me?"
"I'm staying online."
"Where is the briefcase?"
"I'll call you back soon."
"I have your money."
"You heard them."
"I fixed it."
"Do you need it?"
"Speaking of which."
"This is our life."
"She likes him."
"Where is your home?"
"We'll see him."
"Do you want to do it?"
"You have your answer."
"A little dignity."
"It's on the left."
"Who is behind this?"
"You are the boss."
"You're leaving tonight."
"What are the rules?"
"Who is the best?"
"Who are we talking about?"
"Yes, they are there."
"Where are you going now?"
"Thank you for the gift."
"Completely normal."
"He did well."
"Where is the cat?"
"He's your boss."
"The door is blocked."
"How can I know?"
"It's hiding something."
"You're a man."
"I will set you free."
"Where is the newspaper?"
"So, what does it give?"
"Thanks for the trip."
"It's been months."
"Have you ever tried it?"
"Yeah, it'll be fine."
"No one deserves this."
"Where is the proof?"
"You are a thief."
"No one will."
"She must be here."
"Do you want children?"
"I don't have anything better."
"Where is your girlfriend?"
"They are up there."
"How is your daughter?"
"Who wants some tea?"
"Have you seen her again?"
"Ask me a question."
"Do we have an address?"
"Shall we change the subject?"
"We are on a mission."
"Did you want to see us?"
"We can fix this."
"Is he still there?"
"You've grown so much."
"This is my arm."
"It's like me."
"Didn't you see?"
"And where are they?"
"I helped her."
"She's a client."
"She is really pretty."
"I have to see this."
"Yes, it's amazing."
"Once a week."
"It was good, huh?"
"What is his number?"
"Who is it from?"
"OK, that's good."
"Are you happy now?"
"I propose a toast."
"I want the money."
"Yes, it was great."
"I can pay you."
"I spotted it."
"How do you explain this?"
"I finished it."
"I'm all excited."
"I am very excited."
"Then he left."
"Did someone come?"
"Is my wife here?"
"It worked well."
"Not a good idea."
"That's it, man."
"That's true, what."
"She loves you very much."
"Almost everyone."
"I am so proud."
"He has a daughter."
"Fingers crossed."
"You've really changed."
"I will watch over her."
"They are on board."
"It was a question."
"Put it in a safe place."
"It's a church."
"I have to thank you."
"He has your eyes."
"You know the type."
"Who is with her?"
"Are these yours?"
"She betrayed us."
"Yeah, I know that."
"No sign of them."
"No, I like it."
"Not to our knowledge."
"I am very well."
"They took her."
"Should I calm down?"
"Do you think you know me?"
"Good for us."
"Where is the shooter?"
"Guess who's here."
"Good night, girls."
"It's my stomach."
"With or without you."
"We're going to have a good laugh."
"Will you let me in?"
"Yes, I swear."
"I created it."
"Do you have a date?"
"If you allow it."
"I'll stop you."
"Go to the back."
"It's a fortress."
"What are my options?"
"I was watching TV."
"She's for you."
"Las Vegas Police."
"Do you want to go eat?"
"Come to my room."
"Like you and me."
"You don't speak?"
"Give me the map."
"This is extremely important."
"You're next."
"I have an interview."
"You have one week."
"It must be said."
"I will come back tonight."
"They are really good."
"I commit to it."
"How is my father?"
"So what was it?"
"Are you looking for work?"
"Yes, I want it."
"Where is the truck?"
"Just a little bit more."
"It's a facade."
"Give me that thing."
"And I understood."
"Can you open it?"
"I'll take them all."
"What is the truth?"
"He's a policeman."
"When can you start?"
"And I would do it again."
"I'm in town."
"They are so beautiful."
"It's the jungle."
"He will change his mind."
"Yes, that would be great."
"It's all over now."
"Who are you thinking of?"
"It's going to be easy."
"How does he do that?"
"I have to take him."
"We have a visual."
"You two, follow me."
"And he loves me."
"I just wanted to know."
"She spoke to me."
"It's pretty quiet."
"I've been through this."
"It's kind of cute."
"What is your theory?"
"He fought."
"I really believe it."
"No sudden movements."
"I'm going on a trip."
"People need to know."
"Good night, my angel."
"How are the boys?"
"I have ideas."
"What was he talking about?"
"Just water."
"You're forgetting one thing."
"He's doing well."
"It's very recent."
"Who are you again?"
"Yes, that's normal."
"Serves you right."
"I love your dress."
"You had to do it."
"My car is outside."
"It's a tumor."
"Where did you study?"
"Well, that's good."
"But I will try."
"It's very reassuring."
"Where is your cell phone?"
"Yes, he is right."
"You should ask him."
"Access is prohibited."
"We take my car."
"You have to let it go."
"I find it fascinating."
"Nobody cares."
"She doesn't sleep."
"It's absolutely perfect."
"Tell him to wait."
"It's a house."
"We'll go see."
"She is with him."
"Can I kiss him?"
"I came here."
"It could be good."
"I'll come by later."
"It's a mobile."
"Quick and easy."
"Don't you notice anything?"
"There's something new."
"My father is sick."
"Are you the doctor?"
"The store is closed."
"He was a cop."
"She is very close."
"You can be proud."
"It's a kidnapping."
"I will go with you."
"Let's take action."
"I am very calm."
"I touch wood."
"Let me talk to you."
"You're going to be a dad."
"Thanks for listening."
"Did she leave you?"
"We are pros."
"Who decided that?"
"Yes, she's right."
"You are a machine."
"I'll call you soon."
"I was on the phone."
"Nobody likes him."
"This would be a first."
"Do you want a tissue?"
"Are you going to bed?"
"It was my birthday."
"Did you wait long?"
"You've grown up a lot."
"Where are the men?"
"I wrote everything down."
"Are you coming to my house?"
"I am still young."
"This is the guy."
"I want results."
"You have three minutes."
"How was your evening?"
"He's like you."
"Well, I do."
"They got us."
"Let me do this."
"Who is his father?"
"You should have come."
"How was the party?"
"How are you up there?"
"That will be all, gentlemen."
"Good luck, my friend."
"I have needs."
"Where is my glass?"
"How would he know?"
"No one is following us."
"More than usual."
"This must be it."
"You know how to do it."
"She'll get there."
"She's hemorrhaging."
"How do you plan to do this?"
"He has something."
"Did you write it?"
"He's your uncle."
"Who authorized this?"
"This is an example."
"Give me a drink."
"I always knew."
"This is my style."
"It's very deep."
"Does this happen to you often?"
"Call me back later."
"He wants to meet you."
"I'm still working on it."
"Who were these people?"
"I want it now."
"Two and a half years."
"Why do you have this?"
"It's a formality."
"You will change your mind."
"From A to Z."
"She's holding up."
"It's been three years."
"No one will see us."
"A little bit, yes."
"Are you the manager?"
"I entrust it to you."
"This is our motto."
"What is your answer?"
"How did they get in?"
"It's a victory."
"I helped him."
"What would be the point?"
"It's his home."
"It's a hotel."
"Have a good time."
"That's quite enough."
"I was counting on it."
"Does it really matter?"
"No one can enter."
"I was clear."
"We are family."
"She left."
"It's a diversion."
"He is capable of it."
"She is so small."
"I have to get up."
"You're safe."
"Who is it, darling?"
"That's right, Dad."
"Where is the video?"
"Go back to the car."
"You won't leave."
"This is really lovely."
"Oh, here we are."
"I want to kiss you."
"They are preparing something."
"Oh, it's me."
"Why are you talking to him?"
"I was just thinking about that."
"That's it, yes."
"Do you have any friends?"
"You were my friend."
"It really is."
"She is so kind."
"I like the idea."
"And who are they?"
"I will write it."
"Yes, I see them."
"I'm getting married tomorrow."
"I am short."
"We have plenty of them."
"I love your daughter."
"Should we go there?"
"And I will be there."
"What am I thinking?"
"What do I think?"
"That's right, sorry."
"My name is Bond."
"You have the right."
"How much did it cost?"
"It's a door."
"I can drop you off."
"Are you leaving us already?"
"We searched everywhere."
"Do you find anything?"
"There's something."
"Thank you for your honesty."
"Have I been clear?"
"Someone is here."
"He's my lawyer."
"I'll hold on."
"She is carrying my child."
"There is a crowd."
"You don't know them."
"I'm fine, Mom."
"You can keep them."
"Your fly is open."
"We're going to stay here."
"Come play with me."
"No, I tell you."
"Congratulations on your promotion."
"You made it."
"What is the topic?"
"It's a market."
"He was executed."
"Come on, spill the beans."
"There's no one here."
"Yeah, that's great."
"What I am."
"He's a pirate."
"Yes, you know that."
"So what's the point?"
"I am in heaven."
"Can we go home now?"
"Not a single word."
"A package for you."
"Are you going to stay there?"
"It's a ritual."
"Who has the keys?"
"Give me an hour."
"I have five."
"He knows his stuff."
"You are the first."
"This is the exit."
"Are we waiting for someone?"
"To change our future."
"He's my hero."
"It makes us happy."
"They retreat."
"I have even better."
"It's really exciting."
"Where can they be?"
"That could be it."
"You're the boss."
"Time is precious."
"I love my son."
"A storm is brewing."
"Who told him?"
"Have some fun."
"He is our father."
"She's for me."
"I know that face."
"It's the other one."
"I'll keep in touch."
"I would say no."
"When you are ready."
"Have you met her?"
"It's dark in here."
"He assaulted me."
"Four, three, two, one."
"Where were you hiding?"
"I don't want it anymore."
"There is still time."
"For many reasons."
"I was looking for something."
"Do you work for him?"
"Sorry, I have to answer."
"I like your hair."
"I love your hair."
"You don't feel it?"
"He collapsed."
"Go ahead, big guy."
"That's good, there."
"I'll do it tomorrow."
"It's okay, come on."
"I have control."
"I paid attention."
"You've got balls."
"All sorts of things."
"So who was it?"
"I have a card."
"It's winter."
"Where is the king?"
"Who were you with?"
"Two or three days."
"Who talks like that?"
"It's your party."
"I will look into it."
"I never drink."
"Go ahead, my dear."
"She is very strong."
"You are a vampire."
"Get them out of here."
"What does it depend on?"
"Thank you for hosting me."
"This area is prohibited."
"People like that."
"She is a lady."
"She got it."
"Didn't you hear anything?"
"Are we doing this here?"
"He is very pretty."
"I will call you tomorrow."
"Where is the judge?"
"No, it's us."
"Do you have a pencil?"
"No, it's her."
"I apologize, sir."
"Moving forward."
"I looked at him."
"What is the mission?"
"I make coffee."
"How is my boy?"
"I demand an explanation."
"I want to protect you."
"Your time is up."
"You will understand later."
"Do you want eggs?"
"Let me make it up to you."
"A billion dollars."
"He is in surgery."
"It's their right."
"What have you become?"
"Where did you learn?"
"I'll be brief."
"It's a mutiny."
"They fought."
"Are you on your period?"
"I have a pen."
"I take a picture."
"The dining room."
"It could be better."
"Here he comes."
"What's the point of arguing?"
"Get in the back."
"A glass of milk."
"Oh, that's cool."
"I'm on parole."
"Do you have anything to eat?"
"I'll handle this."
"He betrayed me."
"You always do."
"You can always try."
"Hope keeps us alive."
"I believe you."
"Very good, and you?"
"No, that's fine with me."
"Don't you want to?"
"He's a beast."
"Have you been married?"
"It can be long."
"Are you being smart?"
"You are a god."
"You got this for me?"
"It's quite impressive."
"She is very cute."
"I love my children."
"Are you going out with her?"
"I'll get used to it."
"I feel his presence."
"I already have some."
"Where is the ring?"
"This is advice."
"That's very thoughtful."
"How are your parents?"
"You were talking about me?"
"You have to believe us."
"That's pretty."
"Come in with the milk."
"That's right, Mom."
"Not a pretty sight."
"How can I trust you?"
"Do you play golf?"
"I already do it."
"I have some information."
"It's my passion."
"Nice to be here."
"Give me the tape."
"In New Jersey."
"We will keep you informed."
"I ate it."
"And I mean it."
"I am a robot."
"Give me something to eat."
"God is with us."
"Hot water."
"We are scientists."
"I got pregnant."
"But no, it's fine."
"I'm always hungry."
"Still no news?"
"It's a school."
"I have savings."
"Like all of us, right?"
"We are aware."
"I work for you."
"Which is true."
"This is my investigation."
"And I succeeded."
"Do you have permission?"
"I can protect you."
"She looks like an angel."
"I was six years old."
"What are his chances?"
"I've seen some."
"Thanks for the wine."
"I could talk to him."
"Yes, who are you?"
"This meeting is over."
"What is his position?"
"Did you catch it?"
"We'll get to that."
"That's definitely it."
"If needed."
"What kind of dream?"
"Dad, are you there?"
"Will that be all, sir?"
"How did you come?"
"Are you still standing?"
"It's very real."
"It can do it."
"It doesn't work anymore."
"He is very powerful."
"I love this idea."
"Who invited you?"
"You are very elegant."
"What were you going to do?"
"This is my boat."
"I don't eat."
"And when will that be?"
"You have work to do."
"He has a girlfriend."
"Nobody knows why."
"This is the proof."
"Did you have an appointment?"
"I can hear you."
"Have you met?"
"Because I do."
"It's really wonderful."
"And I'm fine."
"You will never understand."
"I'm looking for work."
"I feel it too."
"My mother is gone."
"I pushed him."
"Do you want an autograph?"
"Let's say that."
"They are after me."
"I felt good."
"It's all fresh."
"It's still true."
"We'll do it together."
"Nothing stops him."
"Go wherever you want."
"What do you think you're going to do?"
"I left her."
"We have witnesses."
"I had a plan."
"Where is the switch?"
"How original."
"I know this story."
"Where is the camera?"
"I want a cigarette."
"Did you question him?"
"He needed it."
"That was my plan."
"What are you here to do?"
"Who are these women?"
"He stayed there."
"She's used to it."
"Smoker or non-smoker?"
"Talk to him about what?"
"I want to find her again."
"Only a few minutes left."
"He is too powerful."
"Now I know why."
"They are killers."
"Where is your phone?"
"How do you plan to do it?"
"I want two."
"How is your mom?"
"I'm looking for a girl."
"This is our room."
"I love parties."
"Dad, where are you?"
"There is everything."
"I know his name."
"Come on, I'll walk you home."
"I'll cover you."
"You're a champion."
"Thank you for the evening."
"Honey, I love you."
"I had had enough."
"Are we going for a walk?"
"It's wiser."
"Would you come with me?"
"Put it on the back burner."
"I have a house."
"This is the code."
"I'll shut up."
"We will work together."
"I got it back."
"He has one."
"You can't even imagine."
"I am at peace."
"People like you."
"You were almost there."
"Did you touch her?"
"It's a doll."
"I'm really hungry."
"No, it was you."
"He is in good shape."
"If we want, yes."
"I have the number."
"Don't show yourself."
"Stay around."
"No, that will be all."
"OK, here we are."
"I abandoned him."
"You've changed a lot."
"We should talk to him."
"Just a little."
"It suits me fine."
"Do you want my jacket?"
"All at once."
"But where were you?"
"I didn't know him."
"Something is eluding us."
"And you believe her?"
"This could be interesting."
"The room is full."
"It would take a miracle."
"It's been six months."
"A little company?"
"How are you, darling?"
"Who says otherwise?"
"My work is done."
"Not yet, but soon."
"Do you want to buy it?"
"Go ahead, show me."
"Keep your head in line."
"We did well."
"We thought about it."
"It's a drug."
"We will treat you."
"More than a year."
"Did she call you?"
"You should go see."
"But I want it."
"They look like real ones."
"It's cheaper."
"Can I take them?"
"Back to base."
"Free as a bird."
"I'm going back there."
"Don't you want to come?"
"I have a contract."
"Do you see the difference?"
"And it was true."
"This is my mom."
"Who is my father?"
"A sign of what?"
"Come on, I'll take you back."
"It's non-negotiable."
"Only one minute left."
"I work for them."
"We all know that."
"I was invited."
"Are you going on vacation?"
"Who has time?"
"I don't know how to dance."
"I will think of you."
"That's my line."
"Where is my cell phone?"
"Did you talk to me?"
"Are you really here?"
"Do you know the news?"
"He is indeed there."
"Absolutely sure."
"Not a soul alive."
"You matter to me."
"Did you find her?"
"Will you come see me?"
"She doesn't react."
"I want to see you again."
"She is a teenager."
"It's a boat."
"What can I add?"
"It will come back to me."
"I admire your work."
"You look better."
"I love this smell."
"It's been a month."
"He got you."
"Are you new here?"
"Return to your desk."
"Not at all, no."
"I was eight years old."
"What do you really want?"
"We were called."
"Get online."
"You should listen to him."
"That's a good one."
"I have to ask you."
"I'll join you there."
"I counted them."
"These are my men."
"It was very informative."
"She is much better."
"These are my daughters."
"What is he doing now?"
"How do you talk to me?"
"It's their nature."
"Do you have a lawyer?"
"So come with me."
"His place is here."
"Wait until you see this."
"We're fine here."
"Make me an offer."
"I'll be there tomorrow."
"Where does this leave us?"
"Go ahead, buddy."
"No, I don't like it."
"The customer is king."
"And I know it."
"You won't kiss me?"
"Don't let anyone in."
"It's the hormones."
"It's funnier."
"It was my home."
"I have a list."
"I recommend it to you."
"He is mine."
"You played well."
"Anything in particular?"
"There, it's good."
"It will all be over soon."
"What do we drink to?"
"Yes, he was there."
"The hospital called."
"What do you want from us?"
"Did you cut yourself?"
"I hear footsteps."
"The police are looking for you."
"I find him cute."
"I should call him."
"What do you want to prove?"
"No questions asked."
"Who is in charge?"
"He is very nice."
"You're like me."
"Do you have any photos?"
"She was my sister."
"What are they playing at?"
"Would that make you happy?"
"He's really cute."
"Goodbye, Grandma."
"How can you know?"
"Until today."
"It should have worked."
"I am a victim."
"You're going to enjoy yourself."
"I know my job."
"Hundreds of times."
"What did they take?"
"Well, that's it."
"Nobody is there."
"It's a plus."
"I'm going to the cinema."
"He's not far away."
"Not that much."
"I chose it."
"They agree."
"He's awesome, right?"
"That's all, gentlemen."
"Can we finish this?"
"Yes, I feel it."
"What is your question?"
"We have two."
"I know them well."
"He was so handsome."
"Especially right now."
"I was with her."
"It's a closet."
"I took everything."
"It's very precise."
"Isn't she cute?"
"You woke me up."
"She's cute, isn't she?"
"And I respect that."
"This is our guy."
"There is me."
"But for what reason?"
"But I will have it."
"They are ahead."
"I received this."
"It will calm down."
"It's a pigsty."
"That's twice."
"I don't like anyone."
"Did you recognize him?"
"Kiss her for me."
"And I believe it."
"I just wanted to check."
"I want proof."
"It's a fantasy."
"Have a nice trip."
"But she's fine."
"I like this name."
"How do you like it?"
"Whatever it is."
"Can I ask why?"
"Finally some good news."
"I like her very much."
"In the good old days."
"It's the fashion."
"He took everything."
"It's a mission."
"What is this word?"
"Where is the detonator?"
"What is the result?"
"This is the first one."
"Where is the merchandise?"
"I know, I understand."
"May God keep us."
"Come see something."
"They don't listen."
"Where are his parents?"
"Shall we call the cops?"
"Did you report it?"
"Who is he talking to?"
"I have already paid."
"Come and see."
"Did you write that?"
"It's a big one."
"I will join you there."
"The press is here."
"This is the custom."
"It is very effective."
"I like dogs."
"Circumstances have changed."
"They are all there."
"Go to school."
"Welcome to my life."
"He can do anything."
"Yes, it's us."
"Do you want to see it?"
"You're a hero."
"I'm coming for you."
"Did you listen to me?"
"I'm trying to work."
"Come whenever you want."
"Is that your opinion?"
"You must follow me."
"Return to your seats."
"This is my cat."
"It's more convenient."
"What exactly do you want?"
"This is the original."
"You will have your share."
"What did I forget?"
"It's a vegetable."
"It's shorter."
"And that was it."
"Good job, guys."
"The water is hot."
"You must hurry."
"She is an actress."
"And the others too."
"I'm going to hide."
"I like you too."
"It's very comfortable."
"Yes, it's wonderful."
"How is my daughter?"
"I appreciate your frankness."
"As far as possible."
"It must remain secret."
"That's his style."
"Do you have the number?"
"This is my body."
"Are you having anything?"
"Does it make a difference?"
"She was my daughter."
"It's a word."
"How is my hair?"
"Didn't you say anything?"
"This guy is amazing."
"I'll come and get you."
"How are you here?"
"That's a no."
"I have the same one."
"The film is over."
"I have to end this."
"It's high time."
"We are on duty."
"I'll explain everything to you."
"You don't exist."
"It might do."
"We must be strong."
"Oh, you're here."
"It's a family."
"I'm going upstairs."
"I know the way out."
"Oh, he's fine."
"We can be friends."
"I just want to understand."
"I was a child."
"Can you fix this?"
"That's enough, you two."
"What is the alternative?"
"Oh, that's pretty."
"You can do it yourself."
"Where's the point?"
"I'll fix it."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"Now listen to me carefully."
"Try to stay calm."
"It's really great."
"We should do that."
"I was very young."
"Who remembers?"
"You have been chosen."
"Oh, I love you."
"Don't hide."
"They were all there."
"I was adopted."
"Not yet, at least."
"Where are your clothes?"
"I have forgiven you."
"I'll return it to you."
"Tell us about yourself."
"Can we concentrate?"
"Someone like you."
"What you are."
"I could feel it."
"It was the hospital."
"Better to be careful."
"She's on the phone."
"Now more than ever."
"I prefer to keep quiet."
"You always say that."
"How do we feel?"
"How much are we talking about?"
"It makes more sense."
"Forward, a third."
"Unlike others."
"I had a blast."
"That's my first name."
"Can we meet again?"
"And rightly so."
"Everything has been said."
"I read them."
"What's your number?"
"It's the season."
"The decision is yours."
"I volunteer."
"These are proofs."
"Do you want some bread?"
"I have that too."
"Is he your friend?"
"No, she went out."
"What did I win?"
"It must be you."
"Where is the radio?"
"You will find a way."
"You will do nothing."
"I know your secret."
"This is the dream."
"I admire you very much."
"His car is there."
"A quarter of an hour."
"With luck."
"Oh, I know."
"It's your nature."
"Did you bring it?"
"Who wants a beer?"
"I must not."
"I'm doing something."
"I came to get the news."
"He is in front of you."
"I'll let you discuss."
"I don't sell."
"I command you."
"This makes perfect sense."
"Do you know my father?"
"Can you hold this?"
"He will calm down."
"This is my girl."
"Sounds pretty good."
"I know, darling."
"It's the postman."
"To some extent."
"It's quite rare."
"Do you want some cake?"
"The door was closed."
"The taxi is here."
"I slept well."
"I'm going with her."
"It's a snake."
"Go inside the house."
"You can't do anything."
"Do you have kids?"
"The weather is so beautiful."
"And we will."
"Give me your wallet."
"Are you capable of it?"
"He's someone."
"How curious."
"Are you going to rat me out?"
"I married her."
"Not for years."
"This is your man."
"They are criminals."
"Let's go to my room."
"Look at me, look at me."
"One at a time."
"A bit like you."
"Is this your brother?"
"After all this time."
"Let's start again at the beginning."
"I like this girl."
"I want something else."
"Don't ask me anything."
"I take the bus."
"This is how it is."
"Can you lend it to me?"
"What exactly are you looking for?"
"I'm going to the lab."
"He's my agent."
"Why are you going there?"
"Yes, they are."
"I love women."
"It's still possible."
"I'm doing my homework."
"It must be perfect."
"Watch your feet."
"You took an oath."
"Me, anyway."
"He already knows it."
"I deleted it."
"It's quite common."
"Stay near the phone."
"It's better now."
"I made arrangements."
"You are very sexy."
"You're going to have a blast."
"It's a camera."
"You are next."
"And one last thing."
"So listen to me carefully."
"I am finally free."
"Who was that?"
"It is a symbol."
"Where is she now?"
"It could be long."
"Are you coming tonight?"
"It seems logical to me."
"Where is the treasure?"
"It's pretty simple."
"You should be proud."
"Be nice to him."
"End of the meeting."
"I'm still thinking about it."
"Are you with him?"
"I'm going to marry you."
"Nobody does."
"I miss him already."
"She is at my house."
"I want to look at you."
"It's very old."
"Enjoy your stay."
"She's a teenager."
"Go get the others."
"Come play with us."
"Go back to your work."
"I'm looking for a man."
"You're going to stay here."
"Let's go back inside."
"I make conversation."
"This is my bag."
"It depends on him."
"This is a signal."
"We are professionals."
"Yeah, I see it."
"Where is the target?"
"Do you like children?"
"She will never come back."
"You get up early."
"Where is yours?"
"This is this house."
"It's a room."
"I thought you were different."
"It will be war."
"I follow orders."
"Do you want to know everything?"
"Yeah, I remember."
"Why do you believe that?"
"You will find a solution."
"I love doing this."
"She has a boyfriend."
"You understand that, right?"
"We already knew that."
"If all goes well."
"And that surprises you?"
"I have both."
"It's very big."
"But he is there."
"It's been two hours."
"Come here for a second."
"I had thought about it."
"Stay in your place."
"You don't know what?"
"You were wonderful."
"Hey, are you listening to me?"
"But I survived."
"Where is the father?"
"Hold it like this."
"You have to tell them."
"He was looking for something."
"That's talking."
"This is my leg."
"Let's get her out of here."
"It was so beautiful."
"This is perfectly normal."
"All you had to do was ask."
"An ID?"
"Let me examine you."
"Did you take everything?"
"But it's getting better."
"I'll look behind."
"He found me."
"So, is this you?"
"I'll get her back."
"I went everywhere."
"What kind of plan?"
"Are you wearing a microphone?"
"It's chance."
"I was at the cinema."
"Something strong."
"Who is the buyer?"
"It's his baby."
"And here we go."
"The cleaning lady."
"I love this piece."
"That's you."
"Almost every day."
"Goodbye everyone."
"They trust me."
"The bullet went through."
"I love this music."
"You always will be."
"It's a phone."
"Come on, that's it."
"And she knows it."
"Your driver's license."
"This way out."
"Where is your helmet?"
"Yes, it's different."
"I was early."
"Did you kiss?"
"No need to walk me home."
"This is really serious."
"With everyone."
"Sit with us."
"I'm doing well."
"Who is your master?"
"No, I am."
"Are you expecting a call?"
"Where is the evidence?"
"Who is this lady?"
"He is still unconscious."
"I'm preparing dinner."
"It's a name."
"I planned everything."
"They want war?"
"Just a little while."
"She's good, isn't she?"
"I am his doctor."
"They grow up so fast."
"He was my boss."
"Oh my God, yes."
"I sincerely think so."
"No, I remember."
"I always will be."
"I wanted to see him."
"What is she playing at?"
"I'll take this one."
"The sun is up."
"It's your role."
"It was definitely him."
"I will keep my promise."
"That's true too."
"No one will hear you."
"She wants to see me."
"I was waiting for that."
"Do you want to be part of it?"
"The answer is there."
"I am the queen."
"Just to be sure."
"They are very pretty."
"The lines are cut."
"We are very happy."
"Return to your seat."
"She works for me."
"I'll manage on my own."
"And do you know why?"
"She looks like your mother."
"The good of all."
"No, that's it."
"Where is the mother?"
"Not during service."
"I'm going to wear it."
"Do you have a radio?"
"Let's stay a little longer."
"It's not them."
"You'll do."
"Did he call you?"
"You understand me."
"When did they leave?"
"Anything useful?"
"But I should have."
"Here, here and here."
"It's been three months."
"I know how to do everything."
"Do you think that's fair?"
"I was five years old."
"This is racketeering."
"Take my word for it."
"Give me a glass."
"They are in there."
"I guessed it."
"He just came back."
"No, it's personal."
"What are the options?"
"Since you say so."
"It was last night."
"This is that place."
"This is his place."
"I know the place."
"Do you have a key?"
"About that."
"Yeah, yeah, I know."
"How are you, friend?"
"Good night, my son."
"I'm better off here."
"I take pictures."
"She's going to wake up."
"But things are changing."
"This is the first."
"This one is good."
"Do you want to go to lunch?"
"Can we talk about it again?"
"She's your friend."
"And she loves me."
"I understood correctly."
"The time has passed."
"I'll go then."
"You were brave."
"There were some."
"It is very noble."
"I'm not waiting."
"But he changed."
"Let's keep this to ourselves."
"I have to talk to them."
"Thank you for the book."
"Keep that in mind."
"Me too, by the way."
"Do you have an explanation?"
"The end of what?"
"Is this your place?"
"I'm going to leave now."
"Are you in there?"
"Don't listen to me."
"He's a tough guy."
"How is the leg?"
"What could I say?"
"You have two days."
"What do you think you will do?"
"He plays with us."
"Let him call me."
"It's almost the same."
"I'm going to make it up to you."
"Between the two eyes."
"Everything is working as expected."
"I have patients."
"Not since this morning."
"The power is out."
"Can I touch her?"
"Count to ten."
"You fucked me."
"Where is the woman?"
"Did you open it?"
"See you next year."
"It's pretty incredible."
"I am a lady."
"But I know it."
"I'll warn them."
"It's freedom."
"Let's go to the hotel."
"Yes, it's cool."
"You love him, right?"
"Thank you for this meal."
"A masterpiece."
"It's still dark."
"Like all men."
"Go all the way."
"You knew that, right?"
"The connection is ready."
"It's a song."
"Take me there."
"You can talk to him."
"I can hear it."
"I love this series."
"There are a lot of them."
"We must stay together."
"I want explanations."
"The wind has turned."
"What did you buy?"
"What were you doing here?"
"How will I know?"
"This cannot be."
"I'm having a lot of fun."
"It can wait until tomorrow."
"I love this story."
"They are ours."
"She's great, isn't she?"
"Take this with you."
"You are very insightful."
"That seems correct to me."
"But it's interesting."
"They are our friends."
"I'm not thirsty."
"Can I open them?"
"They've already left."
"Do you play soccer?"
"I understood you."
"The question is simple."
"It will be simpler."
"You want an apology?"
"Roughly, yes."
"Wait for me a moment."
"What are these things?"
"This is our signal."
"Sounds familiar."
"I want to know you."
"My life depends on it."
"Give me details."
"I was at work."
"I like both."
"Ask him the question."
"I loved him too."
"I should be there."
"Give me your address."
"I will see to it personally."
"We have the results."
"Do you see all this?"
"Maybe a week."
"A car is waiting for us."
"Don't you like her?"
"He will tell you."
"It can be fun."
"I prefer it this way."
"That I love you."
"It's himself."
"Where is the ball?"
"You are right, sir."
"Your attention to all."
"She stays with me."
"They will do it."
"And what is it like?"
"Where are the diamonds?"
"I'm going out for a while."
"I'm past that."
"Yes, I follow you."
"Don't wake them up."
"We'll look into that."
"This is my country."
"It was hard."
"Yeah, if you want."
"My wife is sick."
"He touched me."
"Good night, sweetie."
"I am your family."
"I will introduce him to you."
"I'll make the introductions."
"Very far from here."
"You know what, Dad?"
"We'll check that out."
"It's your responsibility."
"I'm online."
"Something good."
"You should see it."
"What do you say, again?"
"The mission is complete."
"I was so young."
"You kissed me."
"What did you write?"
"Are you doing your homework?"
"He was someone."
"If I say no?"
"The cavalry has arrived."
"Oh, thank you."
"I caught it."
"Who wants dessert?"
"Are you still together?"
"They are men."
"Do you want answers?"
"It should be."
"He is too smart."
"It's a male."
"I spent it."
"Can I speak frankly?"
"He's from the FBI."
"These are the last ones."
"Do you hear that noise?"
"I have to say it."
"Did you go out together?"
"It was this morning."
"It's a monkey."
"Don't come home late."
"But it's done."
"That should be me."
"No matter the reason."
"Madam, are you well?"
"I opened it."
"I want to be here."
"No, I prefer not to."
"Yeah, it's possible."
"We are all the same."
"I love this scene."
"I have a revolver."
"Where is his family?"
"It was on the news."
"That's just it."
"It's just that.."
"Yes, it's pretty."
"Sounds perfect to me."
"And you, how was your day?"
"Yeah, I noticed."
"One of a kind."
"Was that your father?"
"I care about her."
"Where is the general?"
"This is the door."
"I see the picture."
"Can you identify it?"
"He is on a mission."
"Who started this?"
"You have my card."
"Where is your partner?"
"I'm next."
"Where are the cameras?"
"I brought this."
"Go to the hospital."
"It's a car."
"The papers are ready."
"They are my family."
"We have to hide."
"Will you listen to me?"
"I am the last."
"The bar is open."
"I will stop you."
"And I do."
"Not at the time."
"Yes, that's nice."
"So don't say anything."
"She doesn't say anything."
"I will receive it."
"Jesus is our lighthouse."
"I am grateful for that."
"Watch where you walk."
"I have the power."
"Do you want to go somewhere else?"
"Two or three times."
"How do you find that?"
"Where is this guy?"
"And where were you?"
"We will see each other again soon."
"They want to talk to you."
"You heard wrong."
"Did you invent it?"
"He's doing much better."
"Who put this?"
"Give me two."
"This has gone on long enough."
"And she was right."
"Then he disappeared."
"He has the flu."
"It's cinema."
"You are so smart."
"I wanted to see you again."
"I'll find them."
"We are far from that."
"He is a patient."
"How was the flight?"
"She's his sister."
"How do they do that?"
"Do you have any matches?"
"I'll take him down."
"Is he a relative?"
"You were supposed to call me."
"I'm going to wake him up."
"Nothing of the sort."
"It's all up to you."
"I will be delighted."
"Am I forgetting something?"
"We begin the massage."
"You must be thirsty."
"I await your orders."
"He has the girl."
"How did you get home?"
"Who did you call?"
"He wants to talk to us."
"Where is this place?"
"It's politics."
"Look, he's here."
"How are you, madam?"
"I always keep my word."
"Things to sort out."
"We're going to the movies."
"Stay in your seats."
"Where are they taking us?"
"It's a cemetery."
"It's your day."
"Don't look at it."
"We're talking about you."
"Thank you for taking me."
"What's up, Doc?"
"This is very clever."
"You should calm down."
"It's very sexy."
"You do your job."
"She's doing well."
"Give it time."
"But I'm working on it."
"This is that man."
"You had a choice."
"Who paid you?"
"We go around."
"I cleaned everything."
"No, I have nothing."
"Shall we eat?"
"This is the basis."
"We're going on a trip."
"What is your status?"
"You have to leave."
"You proved it."
"You have a job."
"It was an experience."
"He's the mayor."
"It's probably better."
"I turn the page."
"She won't leave."
"And tell them what?"
"We're finally here."
"A fun part."
"I wanted to congratulate you."
"Do you want to call him?"
"I am the victim."
"Is my baby okay?"
"If you're interested."
"Nobody really knows."
"Less and less."
"Do you believe in ghosts?"
"It could be nice."
"Yes, you will."
"Do you see the picture?"
"Send me the invoice."
"Good night, my friend."
"Shall I take your coat?"
"Who is the owner?"
"I want a drink."
"But you knew that."
"I'll call him tomorrow."
"Why ask me this?"
"You can't enter."
"I don't steal."
"It can always be useful."
"It's a key."
"I take the lead."
"The best of the best."
"This is the director."
"I answered you."
"My son is sick."
"I like sex."
"Visits are prohibited."
"It's fine for me."
"I'll pick it up."
"I have a husband."
"But I came back."
"Where is the TV?"
"But he disappeared."
"What is the title?"
"That's my type."
"It changed everything."
"She has a gift."
"She's not ready."
"Come on, everything's fine."
"Whoever you are."
"Everything worked out."
"Where is the kitchen?"
"I have a reputation."
"Did you keep it?"
"What is the name?"
"You needed it."
"Thanks for the champagne."
"I am an imposter."
"What do you do next?"
"To change his destiny."
"This is my back."
"I have to tell you."
"In every way."
"I have to have it."
"Nobody home."
"It's the sun."
"Do you want cereal?"
"So where is he?"
"Nothing will happen to you."
"It's good, really."
"Since day one."
"This is our child."
"I mean now."
"He wants to talk to me."
"We'll bring her back."
"Do you think you can do it?"
"I like this one."
"Don't say no."
"He is a writer."
"We should discuss this."
"We will find a way."
"A love story."
"You're missing out."
"I give them to you."
"I was there too."
"Things like that."
"Your date of birth?"
"What are you doing tomorrow?"
"They did it quickly."
"They came here."
"How is the arm?"
"We all love you."
"Who would have done this?"
"Come here for a minute."
"It's dawn."
"This is my aunt."
"Your room is ready."
"She got pregnant."
"You must be happy."
"You have the floor."
"I already called."
"As long as possible."
"You are really pretty."
"Don't ask me why."
"You are like that."
"It's so easy."
"Do you want to do it again?"
"I agreed."
"Yes, everyone."
"This is the driver."
"Excuse me, do we know each other?"
"Where do we put it?"
"She is no more."
"It's nerves."
"We are complete."
"That's my advice."
"Put the handcuffs on him."
"This is my writing."
"I love dogs."
"You could talk to him."
"I have principles."
"I have a dog."
"Tens of thousands."
"He was right here."
"Oh, it'll be fine."
"Plans have changed."
"Not just anyone."
"Are you going to let me go?"
"That's it, sir."
"Can't you hear me?"
"Can I come too?"
"Yes, everything will be fine."
"I want to hear that."
"I take the stairs."
"He found her."
"And it will be over."
"It's with pleasure."
"People like me?"
"At the action stations."
"He is so young."
"Do I make myself understood?"
"Ah, I get it."
"Have you heard everything?"
"You weren't sleeping?"
"No, we stay together."
"What was that noise?"
"Do you have any names?"
"I have to warn you."
"One of my friends."
"I admire your courage."
"I have a lawyer."
"I take a taxi."
"Who was with you?"
"Would you like to come with me?"
"I called everywhere."
"I know your father."
"Is that you, Dad?"
"Solid as a rock."
"I'm still shaking."
"All systems go."
"He's a player."
"Hello, Officer."
"I am the sheriff."
"But who is he?"
"I'm going to buy some."
"That's part of it."
"How did you survive?"
"Where are my daughters?"
"Welcome to the future."
"You are really cute."
"Why not this one?"
"Great job, guys."
"Let him stay there."
"That was a good call."
"I will serve you."
"He's a model."
"I went back there."
"Here we go, man."
"You're right, darling."
"I need to know why."
"I'll come with you."
"Let him go a little."
"It's been three weeks."
"Nothing, I'm fine."
"I'm having hallucinations."
"Do you know this place?"
"Where are they all going?"
"But you think so."
"I will never give up."
"You never listen."
"No, not for that."
"Only one week left."
"What is your idea?"
"OK, here we go."
"It's the sheriff."
"Like all women."
"Tell them to leave."
"This day has arrived."
"We will get through this."
"This is the priority."
"It is a transmitter."
"And water."
"Go up to your room."
"Call whenever you want."
"He is still here."
"This is your domain."
"We can stay here."
"It's more comfortable."
"She did well."
"I made them."
"Your house is beautiful."
"I should have understood."
"I'm fine too."
"Hence my question."
"I have to hurry."
"I hid."
"There, I have it."
"I recognized you."
"And there was light."
"This is absolutely true."
"Where is the suitcase?"
"Let's get to work, guys."
"Do you want details?"
"Do you have a question?"
"And I knew it."
"Do you like this girl?"
"It's only natural."
"I had work."
"He is a priest."
"It's instinct."
"I know I do."
"He was strangled."
"Do you understand your rights?"
"I was nine years old."
"It was my duty."
"In that genre."
"It looks like a real one."
"I will stay in touch."
"Who sent this?"
"To please me."
"You're mine."
"He is at work."
"No, go ahead, you."
"Yeah, he's here."
"It's the army."
"How is it again?"
"I don't negotiate."
"Was that your plan?"
"They followed us."
"This is very promising."
"You should have said it before."
"I don't think anything."
"I have them everywhere."
"He is an agent."
"We have injuries."
"How does she know?"
"I have the means."
"It's going to be okay, ma'am."
"He has a family."
"I take a pen."
"The field is clear."
"No need for you."
"I'm writing a book."
"I like looking at you."
"I love your show."
"I'll call you back tomorrow."
"It's a privilege."
"Can I be of help?"
"It's in you."
"Want more?"
"Was that why?"
"They are very strong."
"You must stay here."
"Go to the window."
"A little milk?"
"It was on the ground."
"I catch my breath."
"With money."
"I am a survivor."
"Received five out of five."
"I love my father."
"When I was little."
"It's for you."
"So, what are you?"
"It was a lot of fun."
"Why did he come?"
"I want to buy it."
"That was my mission."
"Very good, thank you very much."
"It's so unfair."
"Something simple."
"The phone rang."
"This is your story."
"Wherever he is."
"May I introduce myself?"
"Go to the infirmary."
"I'll explain to you later."
"I'm doing it now."
"Do you know how to play it?"
"I watch the news."
"It's a hologram."
"They are my brothers."
"Let's go to your room."
"You have carte blanche."
"What are they for?"
"It was his birthday."
"It's a precaution."
"That's it, darling."
"People can change."
"I can't read."
"This is my head."
"Her name is Buffy."
"Come back right away."
"We must act now."
"You were good."
"This is my book."
"It's an eternity."
"We can protect you."
"But I thought about it."
"I let it happen."
"He has guts."
"It's been ten years."
"I go through the back."
"You should take it."
"It's a city."
"They already know that."
"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
"This is our role."
"We'll do that tomorrow."
"So you know what?"
"Yes, I do."
"In my whole life."
"She was so young."
"No other solution."
"And thank you for everything."
"Where are you taking them?"
"He was behind me."
"Thanks for the explanation."
"Where is the director?"
"When did you come out?"
"Can you teach me?"
"Not like this one."
"What are the charges?"
"I hope for you."
"That's how things go."
"I like surprises."
"Go to the car."
"We are in Paris."
"Don't tell them."
"This is really me."
"So it's settled."
"She's a thief."
"It will be fine for me."
"It's been five years."
"You smell so good."
"Did I see right?"
"It's a process."
"For what else?"
"Do I have mail?"
"I sold everything."
"Nobody has it."
"You're completely sick."
"I understand everything now."
"Well, do it."
"Come here for a bit."
"I have four."
"You should leave now."
"In those waters."
"That's very brave."
"It's a legacy."
"I can live with it."
"It's all hot."
"I'll be back."
"I am the Slayer."
"He is the best."
"Let's talk about it later."
"What kind of noise?"
"I'll keep an eye on him."
"No one answered."
"It just came out."
"Not cool at all."
"It's perfect here."
"I am a tomb."
"Brothers and sisters?"
"It's his nature."
"Where is the beer?"
"Welcome, everyone."
"How can I be forgiven?"
"It's a chopper."
"God is my witness."
"Come here, my boy."
"You are very cute."
"Thank you for your work."
"My name is Ray."
"He is a colleague."
"This is my dress."
"She's a queen."
"I came home late."
"That's already a lot."
"Sorry for asking."
"Do you let him do it?"
"They don't say anything."
"Are you coming to pick me up?"
"What kind is it?"
"He's fine, thank you."
"Do I have any messages?"
"This is the mother."
"My name is Bob."
"It's an exchange."
"Where are your glasses?"
"I withdraw my question."
"It's just temporary."
"Ask her out."
"Oh, that's lovely."
"I will stop him."
"Don't go anywhere."
"It's a recording."
"That would be really nice."
"A family story."
"I'm going with them."
"Do you recognize this woman?"
"Not in this life."
"You'll love them."
"Do you want to meet her?"
"I'm waiting for a call."
"Yes, Mr. President."
"Who agrees?"
"I would like to see you."
"It's going to be hot."
"Thank you for all this."
"How did it come out?"
"A stroke of luck."
"Not at home."
"It seems to me, yes."
"You didn't ask."
"It's better here."
"I watch my weight."
"Can you take me back?"
"He left that."
"No one will believe it."
"I'll question him."
"Give me his name."
"What are you planning?"
"Call whoever you want."
"That says a lot."
"You can't leave."
"It's going to be fair."
"I am so relieved."
"I am filing for divorce."
"I will accompany him."
"Do you like cats?"
"He will receive you."
"I take a look."
"How's business?"
"This is the uniform."
"And how was it?"
"The power is back on."
"Until what time?"
"What is your mission?"
"You're a friend."
"Would you mind going out?"
"Wasn't I right?"
"Let's go, children."
"You have to see it."
"Can you give me some?"
"I saw it well."
"You are a child."
"Show me your face."
"Do you still have any?"
"This will interest you."
"This is my signature."
"She's a professional."
"You have five seconds."
"Nothing is perfect."
"I want an ice cream."
"I want names."
"Nobody talks to me."
"You mean that?"
"Yes, that's understood."
"Who is responsible here?"
"I understand you perfectly."
"Wait, that's it?"
"There's work to be done."
"We have proof."
"Why did she come?"
"It's an exercise."
"How is your friend?"
"Who is he with?"
"We need to question him."
"It wasn't intentional."
"Tell me no."
"Tell them to wait."
"I'll do the rest."
"Oh, that's easy."
"I'll warn her."
"Come into my office."
"What if they come back?"
"The introductions are made."
"This is my face."
"We make a deal."
"When I'm ready."
"The others, with me."
"I loved my father."
"We are soldiers."
"My name is Earl."
"Okay, that's it."
"He must be stopped."
"You are very attractive."
"It's so much better."
"It was my turn."
"I'll explain it to him."
"Ah yes, I see."
"Okay, I got it."
"The day is over."
"He knows things."
"This is a scoop."
"He likes her."
"They attacked us."
"What were the chances?"
"We suspected it."
"I'm going to be a father."
"What kind of service?"
"What is your specialty?"
"You two, go ahead."
"They're going to get us."
"I still have some."
"Like father, like daughter."
"I'm going to untie you."
"You have to understand this."
"It was right there."
"Come over here, you."
"Are you taking his side?"
"Come on, say something."
"I'll keep it short."
"You are a gentleman."
"Can I read it?"
"Who decided it?"
"Let's go see over there."
"Nor anyone else."
"And close the door."
"She helped me."
"I really enjoyed it."
"I have a system."
"Business first."
"I have his picture."
"Do you have any left?"
"It's exactly the same."
"I can bring it back."
"I'm going to the theater."
"This is my part."
"They always say that."
"I'll see him tomorrow."
"Do you have a tissue?"
"Give me a break."
"How is your foot?"
"I use it."
"I need some."
"I'm waiting for a friend."
"I am a star."
"Who made it?"
"Can you find it?"
"He's a winner."
"Who is the judge?"
"It makes things easier."
"What was the plan?"
"You have two hours."
"Shall we have a toast?"
"I know, sweetie."
"Have you just moved in?"
"It was very impressive."
"We're all fine."
"Not these days."
"I'm going to leave soon."
"We have faith."
"Not every day."
"Not in this city."
"I'm missing it."
"I've had my fill."
"Where are the files?"
"The best in the world."
"Would that change anything?"
"Did they catch him?"
"It was his life."
"Thank you for your interest."
"Let me walk you home."
"My time is precious."
"And to do what?"
"It's really excellent."
"It's a promotion."
"But we are here."
"I'm looking for this girl."
"Who told you?"
"That's right, darling."
"I was born ready."
"Should I take a message?"
"And for dinner?"
"Yeah, I like that."
"You must forgive me."
"Who are you exactly?"
"She looked at me."
"I have to shower."
"I'll tell you when."
"It will be so."
"No, it's nice."
"You are an imposter."
"I didn't take anything."
"They are cops."
"It's karma."
"I'm feeling good."
"I'm fine, thank you."
"She's a colleague."
"Don't come here."
"He's gone again."
"I am the mayor."
"Is there anything?"
"I was traveling."
"They all disappeared."
"So how does it work?"
"How can I make myself understood?"
"He followed us."
"This is my neighborhood."
"What are your names?"
"He takes care of it."
"Who are your friends?"
"It was my life."
"Go see a doctor."
"I felt it coming."
"Nobody knows her."
"I'm calling the doctor."
"I am your mom."
"That would be very good."
"You too, by the way."
"Yes, I got it."
"Where is the princess?"
"She attacked me."
"It's coming, it's coming."
"Let me see it."
"Do you want to join him?"
"Is this your child?"
"This is the heart."
"Come on, it'll be fine."
"Are we celebrating something?"
"Are you going too?"
"As he said."
"I should get there."
"Did you say yes?"
"This is my world."
"Do you want to get up?"
"I'm going to finish this."
"Hand in hand."
"Why do you come here?"
"I start the massage."
"It holds up."
"So, what do we do?"
"Give me his number."
"We continue to search."
"Where can we go?"
"It's sugar."
"Don't be mean."
"This was the case."
"Where is the room?"
"How is the patient doing?"
"It's homemade."
"We saw you."
"You helped us."
"Can I borrow this?"
"It tastes good."
"They were very close."
"Are you talking to yourself?"
"I wish you that."
"A car is waiting for you."
"She is very sensitive."
"It's TV."
"It's really over."
"I don't understand this."
"Do you want to rest?"
"Does anyone speak English?"
"He's at the bar."
"Can you come here?"
"Do you really want to do this?"
"He has a son."
"Think about your mother."
"Well, if you want."
"Are you finished yet?"
"How much do you have left?"
"It is a sanctuary."
"I wanted to see her."
"I work with him."
"Give me the number."
"I just called."
"She is always hungry."
"Just for a few days."
"Where is the antidote?"
"She's gorgeous, isn't she?"
"I can feel you."
"Lunch is served."
"You're exaggerating a little."
"Where did you grow up?"
"Are you going out with him?"
"It was a sign."
"This is my philosophy."
"We'll fix everything."
"Like every time."
"Are you going to keep it?"
"This is a photo."
"I have coffee."
"Does Mom know?"
"Where is the coffee?"
"He was a soldier."
"How is my mother?"
"Do you want a massage?"
"Hundreds of thousands."
"I don't speak Spanish."
"Can you move over?"
"This is Earth."
"From top to bottom."
"Are you telling the truth?"
"I am looking for a job."
"It's power."
"Game, set and match."
"We have to turn around."
"You see it well."
"It will be a surprise."
"She is in mourning."
"He's so cool."
"Who bought it?"
"Come by whenever you want."
"I would love to see that."
"You have to eat well."
"He works for us."
"I have a tip."
"My name is Betty."
"Yes, she is good."
"I say so."
"You are really talented."
"It was a ruse."
"What would I do with it?"
"I can fix it."
"It's really perfect."
"Hey, are you okay?"
"It's over then."
"The wind is rising."
"What is your quest?"
"It's a funeral."
"Do you really have to go?"
"It's your share."
"And the other guy?"
"We have a body."
"What does this have to do with you?"
"He is a teenager."
"Thanks for the money."
"Yes, I will try."
"Lean back."
"He's a teenager."
"Do you have a theory?"
"Wait, I'll come with you."
"Can I have this?"
"I am his boss."
"We deserved it."
"Excuse us for a second."
"Do you want a cigar?"
"Yes, she is great."
"Is this your boat?"
"What evidence do you have?"
"It's settled then."
"I love animals."
"I like men."
"Oh, I like that."
"Do you find him cute?"
"I had an appointment."
"She just came out."
"These are my people."
"What did the stars say?"
"You are very sick."
"So, did it work?"
"Where is my child?"
"Yes, we are fine."
"You're a kid."
"He fucked us."
"I will improve."
"He threatened me."
"You need to apologize."
"Yes, we are here."
"I am very proud."
"No, it's fine."
"Thanks for the lesson."
"What is your excuse?"
"Is that you, Mom?"
"You should have called me."
"You should come too."
"Your father called."
"I wanted to be there."
"Can you confirm this?"
"This can't work."
"Things to do."
"A businessman."
"He's coming here."
"Where is Grandma?"
"Let's go have a beer."
"It's a sedative."
"We're guys."
"God forbid."
"Your sister is here."
"I'm there."
"She defended herself."
"Can I speak freely?"
"You've been gone for a long time."
"Where is the hospital?"
"Where is the package?"
"Here is some water."
"They have the right?"
"He is a journalist."
"She's next door."
"Did you see us?"
"He must be hungry."
"Will you hold out?"
"She was so kind."
"A bit like me."
"Can we go?"
"I am happy here."
"You are my guest."
"You should take advantage of it."
"Some things are."
"You are my baby."
"You inspired me."
"This place is great."
"Which is good."
"And it's done."
"Come in, it's open."
"Is this really you?"
"It's your handwriting."
"Yeah, looks like it."
"Captain's Log, Appendix."
"I know this expression."
"I'm going to park."
"I love this name."
"Who took them?"
"Are we there yet?"
"They wore masks."
"I'm staying here."
"He knows how to do it."
"I can't see anymore."
"I brought it."
"Who is your dad?"
"The lesson is over."
"Not the first time."
"He is very rich."
"They were just there."
"We saw them."
"And what would that be?"
"It's him again."
"But you've changed."
"Thank you and good night."
"Is it really useful?"
"I discovered it."
"Come on, give it to me."
"You will not leave."
"It was a fake."
"I was hoping to see you."
"I don't have it anymore."
"Where is the bottle?"
"It's in English."
"It is a duty."
"The conversation is over."
"You have my permission."
"You are so young."
"I love this show."
"I will never be able to."
"I ate everything."
"People like me."
"You dance very well."
"I have my license."
"She has no one."
"Do you love me anymore?"
"I betrayed him."
"Come out, both of you."
"We sowed it."
"I have traveled a lot."
"Look in the mirror."
"I have powers."
"I'll wait and see."
"Do you trust them?"
"It's very quiet."
"I am an admirer."
"Will he wake up?"
"Can I quote you?"
"Don't act like a child."
"I have the girl."
"You already knew that."
"Keep practicing."
"Yes, thanks to you."
"Do you want a whiskey?"
"We'll take it."
"I have a vision."
"I knew your father."
"I can find her."
"I will do the same."
"You can't guess?"
"We will be seen."
"I want peace."
"Do you have any witnesses?"
"Like all the others."
"A gunshot."
"Where is the file?"
"I was just curious."
"It's a bear."
"This is my last one."
"Someone you can trust."
"Are they talking about me?"
"Where is your costume?"
"Where is the water?"
"I love my brother."
"You should stay here."
"They are angels."
"I will know soon."
"All right, buddy."
"No trace of her."
"Oh, one more thing."
"He will need it."
"No, it's wonderful."
"War is declared."
"I have a baby."
"It's a homicide."
"It's very elegant."
"I was stopping by to say hello."
"You won't say anything?"
"It's going to be tight."
"This is my diary."
"I took it down."
"For good reasons."
"I stopped everything."
"What is the water like?"
"It's going to be okay, right?"
"Bring me your torch."
"I see the resemblance."
"I love them all."
"They will come for me."
"I'll go later."
"A little courage."
"I will keep your secret."
"Will you let me finish?"
"I wanted to do well."
"He is very small."
"It's probably her."
"Who is the woman?"
"Good luck with everything."
"I don't sing."
"Take him downstairs."
"You'll have to wait."
"You are free now."
"So it's you."
"You are an artist."
"I will come back to see you."
"Where is the button?"
"I repeat my question."
"The door closes."
"Do you want the ball?"
"He is very old."
"And they are right."
"Don't catch a cold."
"Can I touch them?"
"How wonderful."
"He has a wife."
"All right, calm down."
"I heard shooting."
"I really meant it."
"Do you want to go dancing?"
"Let's go party."
"Where is it written?"
"We are good together."
"I want to believe it."
"I have to find them."
"Yes, it could be."
"I have a dream."
"That's my signal."
"To pass the time."
"Enjoy life."
"Where are my boots?"
"Yes, it's settled."
"Yes, I know you."
"Are you warm enough?"
"I can imagine it."
"Don't you want to go home?"
"Let's go to the bedroom."
"No, I believe you."
"I am the police."
"I took them."
"Yes, in a minute."
"I take my time."
"They grew up together."
"I am her friend."
"Okay, you're right."
"No, who is it?"
"I have the card."
"I was acting."
"You must have been dreaming."
"Years of practice."
"I'll try later."
"They did that?"
"He still has it."
"I was undercover."
"That's well thought out."
"This is our territory."
"You love him, huh?"
"Are these real?"
"So, see you tonight."
"No one will believe you."
"Am I doing it right?"
"She is a princess."
"We worked well."
"I just finished."
"Who are these girls?"
"I swear I don't."
"A wedding gift."
"It's very sweet."
"She has two children."
"You deceived me."
"Honey, everything is fine."
"It's a flower."
"OK, I'll do it."
"I waited a long time."
"It was a bluff."
"Without leaving any traces."
"Where are the glasses?"
"Yeah, that's perfect."
"Are you looking for a job?"
"I want to hear from you."
"It's forever."
"I appreciate your honesty."
"Orange juice."
"Where is your commander?"
"Can I have them?"
"We got to know each other."
"I'm ready now."
"Breathe through your nose."
"Hurry up and get home."
"I am visiting."
"Where are my bitches?"
"Who is this child?"
"It was night."
"And there you have it."
"Do you accept checks?"
"It's pretty close."
"Yes, I recognize it."
"He had to go out."
"It's very moving."
"I'm flattered."
"It's pretty deep."
"You are his friend."
"When did you go out?"
"Good episode everyone."
"You will be very well."
"He begged me."
"I am really happy."
"Something special?"
"And he knew it."
"I will withdraw."
"God bless you all."
"There you have it, guys."
"Do you have anything to drink?"
"I'm going to change that."
"It's a ring."
"It was yours."
"What is your interest?"
"Throughout the country."
"I want a girl."
"You are worthy of it."
"I am the guardian."
"Ah, that's better."
"Do you want to keep it?"
"Do you find me beautiful?"
"Do you have an alibi?"
"Thanks for the dance."
"A tough guy."
"They are professionals."
"They found me."
"The message is clear."
"Did he see you?"
"That's great, Dad."
"It was heaven."
"I wish I had it."
"Of course, sweetie."
"I want to question him."
"There's a bone."
"I have an offer."
"Where is his daughter?"
"They are coming for me."
"One of my favorites."
"I'm going to apologize."
"I am both."
"He is with her."
"How did she react?"
"He was wearing a mask."
"It's on the move."
"Where is your uniform?"
"Go up to the roof."
"Do you play the piano?"
"What was going on?"
"Not for a single second."
"I have to confess."
"Don't think too much."
"It's nice weather, huh?"
"Where is your luggage?"
"How was he dressed?"
"Take it with you."
"How do you want to proceed?"
"I feel sorry for him."
"You are well informed."
"You see that one?"
"I have the flu."
"We are at his house."
"That's the reason."
"Life is precious."
"The dinner was delicious."
"Where do I stand?"
"It's a hobby."
"Don't wake him up."
"I want to know how."
"Where were you before?"
"I forgot them."
"Yes, pass it to me."
"Oh, look at that."
"Holy water."
"At least once."
"I like him a lot."
"They want your skin."
"And do you like it?"
"We will follow them."
"What are you shooting at?"
"This is our plan."
"We will do our best."
"That's great."
"Will you forgive me?"
"Tell him to come in."
"I don't touch it."
"But that's it."
"A game of cards?"
"Yes, every day."
"It's a robbery."
"I am their father."
"Everything is clear now."
"I had to go."
"Yes, last week."
"What does the people ask for?"
"Do you see this woman?"
"You all look alike."
"We called him."
"I know your name."
"You can ask him."
"Where is the plane?"
"We make love."
"Where would you like to go?"
"Do you have a job?"
"Fresh air."
"So what does it do?"
"He's from here."
"They will hear you."
"How was school?"
"What is the reason?"
"He was my partner."
"Can anyone hear us?"
"The police are everywhere."
"My father is a lawyer."
"He organized everything."
"What do we know about it?"
"You are all invited."
"It's always you."
"It's pretty serious."
"It's been weeks."
"Something is different."
"I grew up with it."
"Yes, here we go."
"It's not brilliant."
"I don't have."
"Do you find me pretty?"
"How is your back?"
"Does this sound familiar?"
"Is this place free?"
"I have my account."
"And what does he say?"
"I am the law."
"I'm going, Mom."
"I have a fiancé."
"One of us?"
"I was looking for someone."
"I was the first."
"You know the situation."
"Did you get them?"
"She will calm down."
"Yes, it's lovely."
"Excuse us for a minute."
"Calm down, girls."
"Not for a single moment."
"It was his son."
"Who is your commander?"
"It was easier."
"I had to say it."
"I have to search you."
"I have to accept it."
"I have ears."
"I call my mother."
"I am a boy."
"Should I dance with him?"
"Maybe I should."
"And the other three?"
"Do you have homework?"
"I will stay standing."
"Settle this between yourselves."
"I have the advantage."
"I still feel it."
"I won't be far away."
"You make me blush."
"Are you going to tell them?"
"Yes, Officer."
"Don't kiss me."
"He is my lover."
"Watch out for the door."
"What if we left?"
"I wanted to meet you."
"I swallowed it."
"Make the right choice."
"I'm taking the day off."
"I can be."
"A man, a woman."
"We're onto something."
"And you are here."
"Welcome to the United States."
"The session is suspended."
"This is his room."
"I am very talented."
"I keep looking."
"The phone is there."
"What were their names?"
"She's in the operating room."
"I see it too."
"Pay attention to him."
"It's both."
"We can handle this."
"Open your eyes wide."
"Or I will."
"The car is outside."
"Do you want to listen to it?"
"Do you believe in miracles?"
"I like horses."
"Family first."
"Do you really think that?"
"Good day to all."
"I pushed her."
"I'll let you guess."
"My lucky day."
"Do you speak our language?"
"I stabbed him."
"It's in me."
"I have to prevent this."
"Nothing ever changes."
"I buried him."
"And breakfast?"
"I love you for a long time."
"We did everything together."
"That would be great, wouldn't it?"
"I am a machine."
"Where is your ring?"
"She has her period."
"I'll go get it."
"He's sitting there."
"It's New Year's Eve."
"He is still young."
"Absolutely fine."
"Go to the hotel."
"Do you have a reservation?"
"Can I call you?"
"You are very calm."
"This is my bar."
"You will be well paid."
"This is his child."
"Who will tell him?"
"Dad, I love you."
"Where is he then?"
"Give me your jacket."
"Don't come back here again."
"I will attract them."
"We can always dream."
"Playtime is over."
"I have a few minutes."
"Who can do that?"
"Is this your card?"
"That's the story."
"I know him."
"Yeah, that's nice."
"Where is my ring?"
"He's going to stay there."
"That's it, baby."
"Quite a few things."
"Do you understand something?"
"I know men."
"Let's move on to plan B."
"I am a customer."
"And it's awesome."
"It must be eliminated."
"I'm leaving again this evening."
"It's the music."
"Not in this state."
"You need to relax."
"Six feet under."
"Well, that's perfect."
"From the bottom of my heart."
"I'm going up to change."
"Where is Grandpa?"
"But she's right."
"I love this photo."
"There, it's settled."
"He has a gift."
"They will see you."
"Good night, my baby."
"You know the orders."
"I will behave myself."
"I almost had it."
"Why does he say that?"
"Three or four hours."
"Wait for me downstairs."
"Do you still see her?"
"What kind of incident?"
"I haven't decided."
"Yeah, that's fine with me."
"Do you have a condom?"
"You are a spy."
"I am the only one."
"Oh, but of course."
"Just the facts."
"It was pretty cool."
"Who wouldn't love it?"
"Nobody understands me."
"A bounty hunter."
"Less than an hour."
"She is too strong."
"What brand is it?"
"Twice in a row."
"The road will be long."
"I can testify to that."
"I think like you."
"What had you done?"
"Top right."
"It's a helicopter."
"Remember what?"
"I have to know everything."
"Do you know these people?"
"Do you know this name?"
"Give me your sword."
"I wrote to you."
"It must be exciting."
"Do you have an invitation?"
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"Drink water."
"Do you have any milk?"
"What do I owe you?"
"We've waited long enough."
"I want your opinion."
"Where is the stone?"
"Just for a moment."
"It's a principle."
"The view is magnificent."
"They are like that."
"I love this plan."
"Your mother is outside."
"Both, I think."
"It would suit you well."
"Happy wedding anniversary."
"She is like me."
"Someone good."
"Where are we here?"
"Do you have a coin?"
"And you love me."
"Yes, we succeeded."
"Once, maybe."
"Just wait."
"It's a group."
"Go see a shrink."
"Is this your baby?"
"It was very moving."
"I have to protect her."
"It's pretty awesome."
"Leave me alone."
"Hi, how are you doing?"
"Where is my seat?"
"And with your mind."
"I know your reputation."
"It's your turn to speak."
"You used me."
"What will I see there?"
"This might be interesting."
"We will accompany you."
"It's a ball."
"The man of the moment."
"I live my life."
"And for the baby?"
"She is sedated."
"Maybe not enough."
"That's it, thank you."
"Me too, mate."
"This is our wedding."
"It's already paid."
"Give him something to drink."
"Thanks for the discussion."
"You're going to be a father."
"I can arrange it."
"You're going to wake them up."
"You have to hurry."
"Did you rat me out?"
"Just like your father."
"We'll talk again soon."
"I'll ask them."
"You know what, Mom?"
"What do you gain from it?"
"Let's spend the night here."
"For a good cause."
"Someone is watching us."
"I want a family."
"What does the police say?"
"It's a female."
"How are we going to get home?"
"I was following orders."
"A little to the right."
"We have children."
"How was your flight?"
"I want to rest."
"Can we do this again?"
"Do you have your cell phone?"
"How did you find it?"
"This is my career."
"Luck is smiling on us."
"I believe in God."
"Would you excuse us?"
"Listen to me for a second."
"The people have spoken."
"She invited me."
"What did she look like?"
"Can I have some?"
"I will prove it to you."
"You were late."
"Where is the sheriff?"
"I worked well."
"Thank you for noticing this."
"They go well together."
"That's great, man."
"It's almost dark."
"It's finally over."
"What was the message?"
"It's a talisman."
"I want a beer."
"Where do you plan to go?"
"Hello, my old friend."
"Is this the new one?"
"She is very attractive."
"How could it go?"
"Can I wait here?"
"It's very poetic."
"I had planned it."
"What's up, Dad?"
"No need to come with me."
"The block is ready."
"And that's enough for me."
"Can she do that?"
"I work nights."
"Oh, here we go."
"No one will see you."
"So there are two of us."
"That's his plan."
"No, it was great."
"Where is your coat?"
"What's he doing there?"
"We have a visitor."
"Not that we know of."
"They are doing very well."
"Thanks, it'll be fine."
"I can deal with it."
"It was his room."
"He's the owner."
"Go watch TV."
"I want to see everything."
"You are the key."
"Do you have a number?"
"That's very reasonable."
"Give us a few minutes."
"His eyes are open."
"And me, in there?"
"She's an adult."
"Mom, I'm fine."
"I was rather busy."
"Put me down."
"I have permission."
"It's been three hours."
"That's what's been said."
"He promised it."
"Thank you for your presence."
"Whatever it takes."
"How was the movie?"
"Are you from the village?"
"Sir, is everything okay?"
"That's my goal."
"I just tried."
"But not to me."
"Thank you for your loyalty."
"Do you have cash?"
"It's the beard."
"Oh, that's amazing."
"What kind of game?"
"No, I forgot."
"How did I do it?"
"Then she left."
"No pun intended."
"Stay here with me."
"Can I walk you home?"
"His condition is worsening."
"You are truly amazing."
"It needs to be changed."
"Why are you arguing?"
"Happy birthday, my dear."
"We're going to train."
"Obey your mother."
"Business is going well?"
"I am Spider-Man."
"But where is she going?"
"Are you going to see him?"
"You are the eldest."
"I love this part."
"It's still daylight."
"I have to be."
"What we want."
"With water."
"But it's you."
"We have plans."
"I begged him."
"She's so cool."
"What do you call it?"
"No, don't come."
"It's goodbye."
"She got you."
"But I want to know."
"Do you want to see her?"
"She's really good."
"Do you hear the music?"
"Did you invite her?"
"First door on the right."
"Did they see you?"
"Give me that bottle."
"I am a civilian."
"Next to you."
"What you do."
"We all were."
"Did you know the victim?"
"She agreed."
"Do you have a suggestion?"
"Times were hard."
"She hanged herself."
"This is my doctor."
"This is the Doctor."
"She is in town."
"Don't be a baby."
"Are you kidding me."
"What kind of proof?"
"You didn't see anything."
"Something to sort out."
"He is our leader."
"We have something."
"And money."
"I want to explain myself."
"A fireworks display."
"Who are you, sir?"
"See you on Saturday."
"Where are the toilets?"
"Anything to report?"
"He was my hero."
"I know how to do that."
"Are they with you?"
"I had a feeling."
"They said it."
"We'll see you there."
"And for the girl?"
"Like in a dream."
"Proof of what?"
"What was she doing here?"
"Yeah, that's her."
"The divorce papers."
"You are my angel."
"I recorded everything."
"He was a child."
"You have to stay calm."
"It happened yesterday."
"I have cramps."
"He is in Chicago."
"All right, kids."
"I'm going to say hello."
"Do you know the time?"
"Is that you, darling?"
"This is my chair."
"But I think about it."
"While we're at it."
"I'll give them to you."
"I have to fix this."
"He is their leader."
"They still are."
"I have to tell them."
"I'll do it again."
"Your bodyguard?"
"Would you mind signing?"
"Hey, not so fast."
"Yes, you know what?"
"You know why."
"See you in court."
"Long live the new flesh."
"He's probably right."
"It's pouring with rain."
"I wasn't finished."
"Give him a minute."
"I owe it to you."
"You didn't answer."
"I have a boat."
"Go get the ball."
"I love your work."
"You're not finished?"
"It could be done."
"I followed them."
"Is this your office?"
"Where is my wallet?"
"It's really impressive."
"Let's keep a cool head."
"I'll give it to him."
"She's going to love you."
"Does that make sense?"
"You know the story."
"He is a hunter."
"This is my operation."
"We're almost there."
"I would like to believe you."
"I've had enough to drink."
"He is a warrior."
"You know the way out."
"That's great, honey."
"I recorded it."
"He is a prince."
"They are vampires."
"Were you able to sleep?"
"Are these your friends?"
"Who wants to go?"
"It will be a lot of fun."
"Welcome to reality."
"I'm going out with him."
"Do you want a story?"
"I'm leaving here."
"I will send it to you."
"My eyes are open."
"When are we going?"
"It's a mirror."
"I'm within range."
"Get ready to jump."
"I'll drink to that."
"Do you know more?"
"He's an alien."
"Where is this boy?"
"I am very optimistic."
"It's a restaurant."
"That's all her."
"The deal is done."
"I cornered him."
"Everything's fine, Dad."
"It's on its way."
"Let's go, girls."
"Do you have any suggestions?"
"You can quote me."
"It will be our secret."
"Am I the first?"
"It's the jackpot."
"These are facts."
"A word of advice from a friend."
"He wants to see us."
"I was betrayed."
"Is your wife here?"
"I'm having a coffee."
"How is your girlfriend?"
"Give me my bag."
"How is our patient doing?"
"Merry Christmas to you."
"She says no."
"Do you have a preference?"
"What's up, baby?"
"I have your number."
"I took advantage of it."
"Let's go to the kitchen."
"What was she doing there?"
"Should I go?"
"Who is it for?"
"I cut it."
"He will be home soon."
"But he was right."
"For you and me."
"I'll borrow it from you."
"I want to do this."
"A promise made is a promise kept."
"A phone number."
"Always in the same place."
"He is really sick."
"Everything will be fine now."
"He's almost there."
"But he is."
"His time had come."
"Who sent them?"
"It's a descent."
"I have the file."
"First thing in the morning."
"He will take care of it."
"And where are we?"
"I love this house."
"He is a poet."
"Where is the device?"
"She won't speak."
"Who's asking you?"
"That's good then."
"A year later."
"Where is his car?"
"What is the cause?"
"I'm going to buy it."
"Just a quick tour."
"That's enough, that's enough."
"You're listening to me, right?"
"Should I be?"
"Where are your men?"
"I returned it."
"May he be spared."
"I wouldn't do it."
"I would be very surprised."
"We saw her."
"It's really fantastic."
"They are after us."
"The doors are closed."
"The area is secure."
"He can hear you."
"These are coordinates."
"It's not obligatory."
"In the vault."
"It's really good."
"I have to get it back."
"Of course, I know."
"Things are different."
"We know that well."
"It's a pigeon."
"Do you see this mannequin?"
"Do you want to join us?"
"Don't take him."
"It's a computer."
"I'm done here."
"Everything is mine."
"A love letter?"
"You have a good memory."
"Just wait a second."
"The debate is closed."
"I'm starting from scratch."
"That's an idea."
"I have a gun."
"I would love to meet him."
"The survival instinct."
"I have diarrhea."
"Hurry up a little."
"I am someone."
"She's right here."
"You see, it works."
"She will be here tomorrow."
"You said so."
"Just at the right time."
"I could never."
"This should be fun."
"At the back on the right."
"What is your destination?"
"That's good, son."
"I found some."
"Yes, she is beautiful."
"Do you want to read it?"
"This is my guy."
"I don't speak."
"You make me puke."
"He lives next door."
"Let's take another one."
"Thank you for the party."
"You're telling me."
"I'm all wet."
"Are they for me?"
"What kind of operation?"
"We tell each other everything."
"What do I believe?"
"Give me a number."
"Is this your phone?"
"I had orders."
"Say hello to them."
"She is really cute."
"What is the police doing?"
"Does Dad know?"
"Go open the door."
"We'll see about that later."
"It is very informative."
"Do you take checks?"
"Take our picture."
"Was he convicted?"
"Your mother was right."
"And next time?"
"I have my answer."
"I want some too."
"Are you going to see each other again?"
"I'm asking for that."
"I'm going to train."
"You're welcome, my dear."
"I want this car."
"You are a saint."
"It's an accessory."
"How much do you owe him?"
"It's quite interesting."
"It works wonderfully."
"I'll sort everything out."
"What is your decision?"
"This is my reward."
"This is the minimum."
"Ten million dollars."
"These are memories."
"Where is my kiss?"
"She is very happy."
"Thank you very much everyone."
"We must take him."
"I've got you covered."
"I appreciate your gesture."
"You have to hide."
"I was kidnapped."
"I won't do anything to you."
"You should be grateful."
"She doesn't have any."
"It didn't happen."
"Thanks for playing."
"Do you see these birds?"
"He's gone now."
"No, I love you."
"I'll try that."
"Do you know how to fly this?"
"Do you have a cat?"
"Now I'm here."
"I am perfectly calm."
"I have dinner."
"I will stay with you."
"Yes, it was nice."
"We were kids."
"You will follow me."
"I will Always Love You."
"I feel different."
"What kind of doctor?"
"Where is our friend?"
"Is the boss here?"
"Come here, big guy."
"It's quite personal."
"They will find him."
"Try to understand me."
"What can they do?"
"I'll finish this."
"Oh, she's here."
"He is an expert."
"I miss her already."
"Where is the Governor?"
"Except for one thing."
"Yes, I loved him."
"I have chills."
"Tell him something."
"Do we let him go?"
"This is extremely rare."
"These are my favorites."
"We are still together."
"Stay here, I'll be back."
"There, it's perfect."
"When did he arrive?"
"Ask me questions."
"The house is big."
"I had a son."
"I'll prove it to you."
"Who do you want to see?"
"And what is your name?"
"Give me the baby."
"Let's go to the beach."
"It's makeup."
"Thank you, to you too."
"Go to the door."
"For the weekend."
"I'm new here."
"How many is that?"
"So what are you waiting for?"
"I'm watching the game."
"He has a crisis."
"Are you the director?"
"Do you have a sister?"
"Did they wake you up?"
"Did you receive it?"
"I tried everywhere."
"I want to see mom."
"I would like to thank you."
"He is the owner."
"Did you pay for it?"
"How was dinner?"
"Come, come with me."
"Do you see a difference?"
"I gave it my all."
"We did everything."
"It's a tattoo."
"And your date?"
"We'll come back later."
"He cares about you."
"Get in the trunk."
"It's the sea."
"You love me, right?"
"I obeyed you."
"Don't you want to play?"
"The test is positive."
"The Sword of the Morning."
"I'm going to take you down."
"We all win."
"He's a loser."
"Of course, this way."
"Right now, yes."
"Who is on duty?"
"I don't read."
"It would be a pleasure."
"You have potential."
"This is his family."
"They are your people."
"And even so?"
"Yeah, I will."
"Can we leave now?"
"This is who you are."
"Time travel."
"I'm looking for answers."
"I like that too."
"And one for me."
"It's one thing."
"Where is my friend?"
"But I'm right."
"Like many others."
"Do you want bacon?"
"Business is going well."
"There is still a chance."
"Can I touch you?"
"Didn't you listen?"
"Do it for us."
"She's in the garage."
"This is the kitchen."
"We crossed paths."
"Where is your jacket?"
"Is she talking about me?"
"It's from him."
"Come on, I tell you."
"Once, twice."
"She was so pretty."
"I was in town."
"What could happen?"
"It's glass."
"You have to practice."
"Now it's good."
"You came home early."
"Is my brother here?"
"So how do we do it?"
"Six months later."
"Don't be so angry."
"Not that kind."
"Power to the people."
"You should take this."
"Let's go get some food."
"Yes, he is great."
"Not in the house."
"Who are you thinking about?"
"She was very pretty."
"It's a wolf."
"I haven't started."
"We have them all."
"Do you have the results?"
"Can I take it back?"
"I love him very much."
"How do you play it?"
"Are you the boss?"
"I'm going to eat you."
"Buy me a drink."
"These are your words."
"Get rid of them."
"You could do it."
"You are online."
"I like the rain."
"What is our position?"
"Are you leaving like that?"
"It would be simpler."
"I'm in high school."
"Like on TV."
"No need for him."
"Shall I let him in?"
"She was a child."
"I defended you."
"Where is my jacket?"
"He is always right."
"I'll call you back, okay?"
"My father is a cop."
"You are nobody."
"You're never here."
"I still do it."
"That's easy."
"Because I can."
"She got married."
"Do you know this boy?"
"This is my file."
"Very well, my friend."
"It's an island."
"No, I'm fine."
"They are demons."
"It's an intuition."
"Let's see if it works."
"Where is the disc?"
"This is the target."
"And I accepted."
"I appreciate it very much."
"You think of everything."
"At your command, chief."
"It's Morse code."
"Of course, Your Majesty."
"Where is my face?"
"I'm getting used to it."
"That's his nickname."
"I was promoted."
"Who is your superior?"
"Is it serious, doctor?"
"Let me take you back."
"Where is the truth?"
"I'm leaving with him."
"This is our agreement."
"I know a lot."
"I'm going to like it."
"Who is this friend?"
"Send a medical team."
"Not really, actually."
"One second, one second."
"I am the man."
"Don't do that anymore."
"She is a goddess."
"Would you like a cigarette?"
"Where are the stones?"
"It was so cute."
"The road is blocked."
"I call my father."
"He's your nephew."
"You have his eyes."
"What to talk to you about?"
"I was just about to leave."
"I filmed everything."
"Think about the future."
"A dead end."
"You are the last."
"You have some nerve."
"The park is closed."
"Do you have my money?"
"This is an exception."
"We receive a call."
"I'm going to the market."
"Are you comfortable?"
"He's a star."
"The night is beautiful."
"Glad to be home."
"It's her home."
"But what are you saying?"
"Who taught you?"
"He was a thief."
"Your birthday present."
"Give me the box."
"I sowed it."
"Why are you touching me?"
"It must be late."
"There are still some left."
"He got us."
"I'm tough."
"Is this live?"
"What kind of mission?"
"But trust me."
"It's plastic."
"It's the same here."
"Do you have a part?"
"The truth about what?"
"I have balls."
"Yes, it worked."
"They are kids."
"For your own safety."
"I will find my way."
"I haven't changed."
"Isn't he great?"
"Yes, that will be all."
"This is my area."
"I'll talk to him tomorrow."
"They want to see you."
"You have your money."
"It brings back memories."
"I am like him."
"Christmas Eve."
"I can find it."
"Where is the driver?"
"Who's on board?"
"I'm talking to myself."
"Where is my gift?"
"This is the treatment."
"The window was open."
"It's a fish."
"Girls love it."
"If you are interested."
"Do you like your job?"
"Bring water."
"She is my friend."
"I will follow them."
"We have one hour."
"Why are you fighting?"
"Forgive me, my love."
"They have already started."
"It was very pretty."
"This is our policy."
"In memory of the past."
"Do you have anything to do?"
"What should I look for?"
"She isn't."
"I'm the new one."
"You have to prepare yourself."
"This needs to be fixed."
"We were so close."
"We need to create a diversion."
"They will wait for us."
"I know this book."
"I'll bring this to you."
"Go to the hairdresser."
"This is our specialty."
"She is with them."
"He will come for me."
"Someone special?"
"It's a delight."
"No, I insist."
"He left yesterday."
"You're a good one."
"What if we went back?"
"Do you want to see this?"
"Who called you?"
"Not in my lifetime."
"I'm faster."
"Your son is fine."
"It's all of us."
"Think about your family."
"Let's agree."
"I want to get up."
"And you will."
"It was really impressive."
"I had a daughter."
"We are well placed."
"He chickened out."
"I can talk to them."
"I have talent."
"It's a garage."
"About everything."
"We are doing very well."
"I should get back to work."
"He was going home."
"I can see everything."
"You must excuse me."
"Focus on me."
"He's going to get you."
"Have a good end of the day."
"Yes, we won."
"Fireworks."
"I don't decide."
"This is my position."
"I have my methods."
"I have the list."
"Do you want something to eat?"
"Let's go to the police."
"How much are you asking for?"
"And I understand that."
"See you in an hour."
"Where is the beacon?"
"I'm here now."
"It must be nice."
"Something has to change."
"Yes, he will."
"She's barely breathing."
"The meal is served."
"Where are the women?"
"You're always hungry."
"You made it all up."
"It's healthier."
"He's an old man."
"I'm trying to read."
"This will be the end."
"It's Shakespeare."
"It's his phone."
"He is behind us."
"He's getting out of it."
"I think of you."
"Now I remember."
"Not in front of the children."
"Your father is gone."
"Here, have a drink."
"No, as usual."
"Maybe he'll come back."
"What did they find?"
"Are you up there?"
"In an hour."
"Where is the cure?"
"Did I talk to you?"
"You're on time."
"Are you home yet?"
"Thank you, that's perfect."
"You are doing very well."
"Everyone knew."
"It was a reflex."
"He's fed up."
"Praise be to God."
"One, two and three."
"I calculated everything."
"And now look at yourself."
"This is our moment."
"I'll meet you in front."
"Do you have the equipment?"
"Do you think you're strong?"
"Can you reach it?"
"I was planning to do it."
"You, who are you?"
"It came back to me."
"The message got through."
"Do you like jazz?"
"My name is Leo."
"The timing is perfect."
"Come here, sweetie."
"Do you find me sexy?"
"Is this your first?"
"I am Iron Man."
"After that, it's over."
"Until dawn."
"We have the address."
"Something for you."
"Where are your children?"
"Can I go home now?"
"Where are you all?"
"So it was true."
"Do you want a donut?"
"Evidence of what?"
"What's in it for us?"
"This is his version."
"But it's him."
"You know women."
"No need to explain."
"It makes me laugh."
"Are you his lawyer?"
"I'm going to court."
"I ask the question again."
"I fixed that."
"Good night, boys."
"Yes, where is he?"
"Nowhere to go."
"He smiled at me."
"Go take your shower."
"Who is the man?"
"You know it now."
"I was starving."
"I'm right behind."
"Isn't she beautiful?"
"No, she's here."
"Try to have fun."
"Very well, I understand."
"Where is the Ring?"
"Give me your cap."
"It's a meeting."
"You should see her."
"But who are they?"
"I kept it."
"I wanted to take a shower."
"It's at the bottom."
"But I have to."
"He has to do it."
"Do you like horses?"
"Is that really her?"
"Someone was there."
"Sorry, we're closed."
"A brain tumor."
"Rise to the occasion."
"Do you want to see him again?"
"But I knew it."
"I thought I knew."
"So, are we having fun?"
"Where is my dress?"
"I find it sexy."
"I really loved you."
"Do you have your license?"
"Try talking to him."
"A family affair."
"What is your story?"
"Find all the humans."
"My father was a cop."
"Where is my tea?"
"My name is Nick."
"Yes, it's cute."
"He is truly magnificent."
"There are more of us."
"The investigation is closed."
"It needs to be treated."
"I hear someone."
"Otherwise, what's the point?"
"I have the coordinates."
"You were so beautiful."
"This is my heart."
"Who came here?"
"She wants to meet you."
"What do we do next?"
"We'll get along."
"You, you and you."
"He will not survive."
"I was right, wasn't I?"
"You know the law."
"It's going to be perfect."
"She won't answer."
"Two of them."
"What did you bring?"
"They released me."
"It's tea."
"I know these guys."
"What kind of party?"
"It will be for tomorrow."
"I am your wife."
"The plan is simple."
"She's my partner."
"I finish my coffee."
"It was high time."
"A plane is waiting for us."
"They said why?"
"Do I make you laugh?"
"I can find out."
"Do you have a lover?"
"This is my store."
"His mother is sick."
"The question is, why?"
"It's lovely here."
"We have a few minutes."
"Nothing was true."
"You must protect me."
"Return to your rooms."
"I play the piano."
"But I love it."
"Who allowed you?"
"Who was this guy?"
"You ask me why?"
"How do you stand this?"
"They do nothing."
"Maybe even too much."
"Where is the nurse?"
"Time has passed."
"It's our decision."
"No, I'm busy."
"I can hear them."
"Is that your question?"
"Go see your mother."
"You'll never believe me."
"She wrote it."
"I have an explanation."
"I made up my mind."
"You see this guy?"
"Ah, that's it."
"Ah, there he is."
"That's a lot, isn't it?"
"Is this your bag?"
"She was stabbed."
"Maybe a year."
"The interview is over."
"I did the same."
"He is five years old."
"Five horses, five men."
"Are you going to kiss me?"
"Are you going with him?"
"I don't listen anymore."
"What are you here for?"
"No, it's real."
"He was so young."
"It's back to school."
"I serve my country."
"I explained to you."
"I am his manager."
"Is it absolutely necessary?"
"It was your choice."
"Are you home?"
"He understood everything."
"It's a novel."
"I want to be happy."
"What was it called?"
"Enjoy your meal everyone."
"An orange juice?"
"He was your father."
"What are you laughing at?"
"It's perfectly legal."
"Yes, it does."
"We trust you."
"I was one of them."
"That's it, come on."
"We are just friends."
"Have you read them?"
"Do you want pancakes?"
"Talk to your father."
"We liked him."
"Who is your contact?"
"He is really nice."
"It's pretty sexy."
"It's my time."
"What is it, Dad?"
"He plays football."
"I want to go with him."
"It will be safer."
"Where is his head?"
"Did she kiss you?"
"Without telling me?"
"It's better to leave."
"She needed it."
"Now get the hell out of here."
"Where is my office?"
"She is at home."
"I'll meet you there."
"And you, can you?"
"Let me ask you."
"Did you get along well?"
"Come on, come with us."
"You know that yes."
"They must be there."
"I was on vacation."
"Where is his wife?"
"Can't you talk?"
"I demand an answer."
"No, I won't go."
"Come into the kitchen."
"Can you call him?"
"Fine, as you wish."
"It looks like a plan."
"This is my card."
"Did you just move in?"
"Let time do its work."
"Do you want to think about it?"
"I come as a friend."
"Road accident."
"Yeah, that's right."
"What's the catch?"
"This is the doctor."
"He's having a stroke."
"I want to talk about it."
"She wouldn't understand."
"I want to find him again."
"I'm going to wash it."
"Previously on Stargate Atlantis."
"He is very young."
"All right, old man."
"He is too handsome."
"We make a pair."
"Are they still together?"
"I was at the bar."
"Maybe an hour."
"Oh yeah, I forgot."
"Next weekend."
"Come on, it's easy."
"I suffered."
"Test, one, two, three."
"Give me a dollar."
"This is my cover."
"Yes, it's her."
"Where could I go?"
"Don't you feel it?"
"Not inside."
"The question remains why."
"And there she was."
"I changed it."
"Yes, I am fine."
"Spare me the details."
"What do the doctors say?"
"What is its purpose?"
"Stay safe."
"Calm down, friend."
"It's your favorite."
"Where is the sugar?"
"He liked her."
"She has a child."
"The police are looking for him."
"I will do the cooking."
"I've got everything sorted."
"It's so nice."
"That's me, right there."
"The cops are everywhere."
"When necessary."
"See you later, darling."
"I am a child."
"Where is your boss?"
"Do you have any suspects?"
"I was attacked."
"It takes two."
"A bodyguard."
"It was a memory."
"I'll pay for it."
"This is the delivery man."
"Did you like her?"
"I'm up there."
"I'll leave them to you."
"It's so rare."
"It will soon be daylight."
"It surprised me."
"I've done better."
"You saw correctly."
"So that's good."
"I know the code."
"Who invented this?"
"There is progress."
"We draw lots."
"The best there is."
"Take my picture."
"It's super beautiful."
"And I forgive you."
"That would be ideal."
"Everything is fine, really."
"Are you with them?"
"I warn the others."
"He's a nutcase."
"How does he feel?"
"I don't see her anymore."
"I am an agent."
"I love babies."
"Are you a robot?"
"That's beautiful."
"Where are they located?"
"Where is the light?"
"How can this happen?"
"I'll take the next one."
"Do you know this song?"
"Do you find her pretty?"
"What should I understand?"
"I was seven years old."
"Tell us a story."
"You can let go of me."
"How cute you are."
"I was talking about him."
"And everything is fine."
"And how do I do it?"
"You want proof?"
"How are you, buddy?"
"I just landed."
"You have to stay there."
"He is my master."
"That's his first name."
"I have to join them."
"A stone-cutting hammer."
"I seek the truth."
"Yes, I'm working on it."
"We will always be together."
"My wife and I."
"This is my heritage."
"He did everything."
"So what else?"
"There you go, I found it."
"Where is my beer?"
"But now it's okay."
"I'm going to enjoy myself."
"She collapsed."
"You have to find it."
"It's pretty exciting."
"She has the flu."
"We do everything together."
"Like every day."
"Stay if you want."
"Leave if you want."
"I would be too."
"OK, I'll try."
"Do you have the papers?"
"You see over there?"
"Is it full?"
"A credit card?"
"Gather everyone together."
"Go to the bedroom."
"You asked me."
"I have to examine it."
"I loved my wife."
"Not in my eyes."
"We're splitting up here."
"And I apologize."
"I'll come later."
"We open the door."
"Tomorrow it will be better."
"No, it's the same."
"It's a waltz."
"It's always good."
"I'll pay later."
"Or not at all."
"We have customers."
"I have obligations."
"I washed it."
"Honey, are you there?"
"My parents divorced."
"You stay with us."
"Be a good boy."
"What was your mission?"
"I was in bed."
"We are together now."
"I put it there."
"Is this an offer?"
"Can you cover me?"
"Your mother is waiting for you."
"Dad, I'm fine."
"I will do my duty."
"I'm going to drink it."
"Professional work."
"I take the pill."
"He is in Paris."
"Pure gold."
"Can I go play?"
"What will become of you?"
"Do you see anything?"
"Where is the original?"
"She has a family."
"What are you then?"
"Holy Mother, forgive me."
"It was very exciting."
"I'm doing a round."
"This is our priority."
"He will come to me."
"The retirement home?"
"What kind of drugs?"
"I switch to manual."
"Tell me about your day."
"The light is red."
"San Francisco Police Department."
"Where is his file?"
"What are your conditions?"
"Go see for yourself."
"I have one condition."
"He's gorgeous, isn't he?"
"Who do you work with?"
"I will find someone."
"You are a fighter."
"Where did they come from?"
"Okay, I get it."
"I have a contact."
"The plane is ready."
"I have to hide."
"He was my cousin."
"I see people."
"It's going to be okay, honey."
"It depends on the people."
"What did she mean?"
"I'll come see you."
"What do they call you?"
"I'm sticking to it."
"We must protect ourselves."
"Do you want my skin?"
"I'll have a coffee."
"Sorry about your mother."
"We'll clean you up."
"What am I wearing?"
"Are you going to do that?"
"Give me the bottle."
"The opposite would be surprising."
"He is in me."
"Shall we take a taxi?"
"Are you staying a while?"
"I'm over there."
"The perimeter is secure."
"I know, my love."
"Good luck, my little one."
"Go take a look."
"Yes, that should be fine."
"Won't you introduce us?"
"I ask questions."
"I have to be careful."
"This is my first."
"Put your finger there."
"I am a warrior."
"Wake up, man."
"I'm on Mars."
"You have to find her."
"You set the whole thing up."
"This is your destiny."
"Do you want his number?"
"It could be you."
"You are too."
"I have a connection."
"It's the concierge."
"Take her home."
"Just a little blow."
"That's my feeling."
"We'll give it a try."
"National security issue."
"I'm in the bathroom."
"Are you taking over?"
"I'm older."
"Where are we taking him?"
"He's from around here."
"You have to come here."
"I am a pirate."
"Can you take this?"
"She chose me."
"You must miss him."
"We'll tell you."
"Put this on the floor."
"I know the procedure."
"Oh, she's fine."
"Give me the camera."
"I was gentle."
"Thank you for the food."
"You are my guests."
"What is the job?"
"It's over, man."
"What kind of secret?"
"War is imminent."
"When is your birthday?"
"I will introduce myself."
"I'm really happy."
"I almost made it."
"He is a predator."
"It happened quickly."
"And I know you."
"She has one."
"Second door on the left."
"She doesn't listen."
"Tell others."
"We will overcome this."
"What color is it?"
"I have to warn him."
"The hand of God."
"She's having contractions."
"I'm going to make some more."
"I am very good."
"He is moving."
"What's up, bro?"
"You have to understand it."
"That's great, thank you."
"Do you recognize this girl?"
"You're here early."
"It comes from you."
"Do you want some sugar?"
"I'll let you choose."
"Give me back my key."
"Do you want to taste it?"
"Who was first?"
"Something is going to happen."
"What kind of friends?"
"The day will be long."
"If it amuses you."
"Whose orders?"
"Take care of others."
"Oh, that's fantastic."
"I was like that."
"I go back to bed."
"I met them."
"I just want to leave."
"It was pretty good."
"You're already there."
"You did everything."
"The choice is simple."
"I almost waited."
"My name is Otto."
"My dream is coming true."
"I have a story."
"You will be fine here."
"Are you going to take it?"
"He is an American."
"Maybe forever."
"She is in good shape."
"Pour him a drink."
"Thank you for the welcome."
"She is my age."
"It's gonna be okay, man."
"I like that sound."
"They are almost here."
"What are you on?"
"The Trojan sword."
"Is there any coffee?"
"Thank you very much for everything."
"You don't say hello?"
"I want his head."
"Everything is going wonderfully."
"He is a wizard."
"Where do we put this?"
"Where are the guys?"
"Think about something else."
"We are his family."
"Get on the bus."
"Do we let them go?"
"His condition worsened."
"She went there."
"What is the bet?"
"Yes, he knows."
"I am his family."
"I've had better."
"He has character."
"I have a minute."
"Have you eaten enough?"
"I will make it up to you."
"Evidence is needed."
"I care."
"Yes, he came."
"You're sweating."
"Girl stuff."
"The elevator is here."
"Is your brother here?"
"Everything's fine, man."
"It's better to wait."
"Where is my boy?"
"Someone is following me."
"Nothing of great importance."
"It's really huge."
"They are looking for something."
"Do you know something?"
"Isn't it fixed?"
"And you accepted?"
"I am the eldest."
"Shall we sit down?"
"Where is the queen?"
"They called me that."
"You never give up."
"Lower, lower."
"You're a smart guy."
"I've been waiting for you."
"I saw her again."
"How are you, my son?"
"All right, girls."
"I'm letting you go."
"My name is Tony."
"What is he hiding?"
"Hello, can you hear me?"
"How do you see that?"
"This is my hand."
"Let me call you back."
"Let's go back home."
"Houston, in the dark."
"We don't have any more."
"She is capable of it."
"I cured him."
"Thanks for the cake."
"I wish I was there."
"My name is Eric."
"Someone is asking for you."
"We will be safe."
"Are you fed up?"
"Can we hurry up?"
"Do you want to tell him?"
"Your honor is safe."
"I will tell the truth."
"You are like them."
"They know something."
"Go to the kitchen."
"No, I do."
"I was napping."
"Are you playing with me?"
"We must bring him back."
"Do you have time?"
"He is very brave."
"He already is."
"She already is."
"We keep in touch."
"I like them very much."
"It's their specialty."
"I love my daughter."
"Will he get better?"
"As you like it."
"OK, everything is fine."
"But life goes on."
"I invited them."
"It's the drug."
"I'm coming home with you."
"No one will believe me."
"I'll be waiting for you there."
"Why are they fighting?"
"Yes, yes, very good."
"Are you eating something?"
"Did you really like it?"
"You must leave immediately."
"Love letters."
"She never sleeps."
"How will it work?"
"She looks a lot like you."
"Show me the way."
"It's a newspaper."
"You're very generous."
"And your real name?"
"You are the father."
"Our days are numbered."
"Well, I was."
"What have I become?"
"I thought I was doing the right thing."
"I have to have this."
"You unmasked me."
"You can call me."
"It's fish."
"We will continue later."
"Go ahead, tell them."
"See you soon, guys."
"She's awesome, right?"
"I want justice."
"Let me look at this."
"I emptied it."
"Have you identified him?"
"I would have liked to stay."
"But I will find out."
"Yeah, it was cool."
"And I won."
"Arms in the air."
"He's in the operating room."
"It's a phase."
"Do you have any money?"
"Can you see her?"
"Did she believe you?"
"He wants to go there."
"You are heroes."
"I'm coming to get her."
"And for children?"
"Maybe once."
"They were having an affair."
"You know that too."
"I'm going to say no."
"Who is the mother?"
"Are you going back?"
"For personal reasons."
"They are thieves."
"How did you know that?"
"You have to think big."
"Can you come with me?"
"As long as necessary."
"Are you going to open it?"
"I have an erection."
"The studios are yours."
"And where are we going?"
"That's it, keep going."
"This is my bank."
"What you have."
"How's it going, my girl?"
"How time flies."
"I'm already working on it."
"Go back to your business."
"It's the stomach."
"He's hemorrhaging."
"This is my village."
"Have you noted everything down?"
"Sorry about your father."
"Did we do that?"
"Find another way."
"Come on, I'll show you."
"I love chocolate."
"It's his destiny."
"Not in this house."
"He knows it well."
"Good morning, Mr. Mayor."
"Are you still hungry?"
"Who wouldn't want to?"
"It gives food for thought."
"I promise you nothing."
"End of lesson."
"God willed it."
"It's a star."
"I have lunch."
"Listen to me a little."
"And once again."
"What's up, honey?"
"And you succeeded."
"He invited me."
"God's will."
"I can't hear anything anymore."
"Who is the author?"
"We have a goal."
"It's very similar."
"It was a mission."
"I speak for myself."
"And now we wait."
"It's evening."
"Go join the others."
"Are you taking the pill?"
"Seeing is believing."
"We are all brothers."
"They're used to it."
"Yes, he is cute."
"It's really simple."
"Come, if you want."
"I had a reason."
"I'll keep this."
"Who is this little girl?"
"Who will be first?"
"The school called."
"So it's decided."
"I'm from Texas."
"He is six years old."
"Can you tell me?"
"It's a disguise."
"He takes his time."
"No, wait a second."
"That's their thing."
"I have a lighter."
"Have you seen any?"
"Can I use it?"
"Kids love it."
"Say hello to mom."
"Class, San Diego."
"Where are the cops?"
"That will be all, Captain."
"I want my mother."
"We're going to town."
"Can we go there?"
"You have to call him."
"Give me a coffee."
"My friends are here."
"I was talking about that."
"Where are yours?"
"Nothing stops them."
"It's been four years."
"Since when do you know?"
"You created me."
"Do you play football?"
"Am I missing something?"
"What were you dreaming about?"
"And here's to you."
"This one is different."
"I can reason with him."
"It's an assassination."
"Do you see the result?"
"Take me to him."
"They deserved it."
"I have to protect myself."
"I do business."
"You can kiss me."
"I request a suspension."
"Give me your name."
"Are you really serious?"
"In every detail."
"And it was good."
"She is a saint."
"I am the mother."
"But I think so."
"Sorry about this morning."
"I'm super hungry."
"I have it too."
"In the next episode."
"He trusts you."
"That was his thing."
"Two or three weeks."
"It was so romantic."
"Where are they hiding?"
"Because of her?"
"I'm going to see them."
"How do you want to do it?"
"Except for one detail."
"Don't test me."
"He is very generous."
"Watch out for his leg."
"It is our responsibility."
"Can you go see?"
"Are you free tomorrow?"
"The battle is over."
"What are the odds?"
"Did you hear yourself?"
"Tell me now."
"She's a nurse."
"Flight attendant."
"I give the orders."
"You already have it."
"The FBI is here."
"He was mine."
"It's me, yes."
"You look familiar."
"Where is the wine?"
"They were children."
"Let's go back to the car."
"I ask a question."
"My name is Travis."
"Everything is back to normal."
"I'll drop you off."
"No, they left."
"I'm in the car."
"Did you leave it?"
"The weather is very nice."
"What kind of experience?"
"A bribe?"
"My job is done."
"It's made for that."
"Promise me something."
"Does it work for you?"
"I have to do this."
"Isn't she great?"
"I'm going to the store."
"He was with us."
"They cleaned everything."
"What if we went out?"
"Do you have a boat?"
"Nobody believes it."
"I have wine."
"Someone called."
"You have to pull yourself together."
"I will announce to you."
"Not in this world."
"You're in good shape."
"Anakin, do you read me?"
"This is our war."
"So far, so good."
"The school is closed."
"May they be happy."
"Does he have a background?"
"They are soldiers."
"What choice do we have?"
"Are you walking or not?"
"How are you guys?"
"We could talk about it."
"I have to call you back."
"It's the storm."
"I understand your situation."
"Let him rest."
"Where are the kids?"
"Yes, she is cute."
"That's enough, children."
"No, I don't walk."
"She is so sweet."
"I'll be right here."
"Thank you for welcoming us."
"They are our children."
"It's up to you to judge."
"It's a game changer."
"You are so strong."
"You're an artist."
"Let me be the judge."
"You are really lovely."
"You should have known that."
"We can do otherwise."
"Your father was right."
"I care about him."
"I made that up."
"You look a lot like him."
"Can you hear me well?"
"This is the tree."
"He's buying time."
"We wonder."
"It's very classy."
"And what do you think?"
"Like a date?"
"We should let it go."
"Go ahead, my daughter."
"They don't want to."
"Hey, is everything okay?"
"A rose of twilight."
"Come back inside."
"Nobody lives here."
"My name is Trudy."
"Tell me good luck."
"I listened to you."
"He is regaining his strength."
"He suffered."
"A chance of what?"
"They want my skin."
"It's too powerful."
"How did she know?"
"There will be."
"My heart is racing."
"It's super sexy."
"You should listen to me."
"Keep a cool head."
"Where is the priest?"
"We are aware of this."
"It's very tight."
"How did you get back?"
"I was going to go there."
"You'll never get there."
"He is nine years old."
"I'm going around in circles."
"It's all written there."
"We can talk here."
"Can you take us?"
"Do you want a room?"
"I'm not touching you."
"You've got it all planned out."
"He will love you."
"Yes, we are ready."
"Yes, I see."
"And maybe not."
"Will you call me tomorrow?"
"It was cut."
"How should I do it?"
"I had your word."
"Both, actually."
"It's gonna be okay, baby."
"Where is the party?"
"They will hear us."
"It's a box."
"Everything can be arranged."
"If only I knew."
"Are you here too?"
"I'll bring the car."
"One and a half million."
"He's a leader."
"He's still there."
"I trained him."
"So who am I?"
"What were they talking about?"
"What are you into?"
"My father is waiting for me."
"What is your dream?"
"Very well, my boy."
"My name is Jennifer."
"He is in front of me."
"That's very wise."
"She should be here."
"He works miracles."
"My name is Abby."
"It was his decision."
"Give me your word."
"Glad to hear from you."
"You are a witch."
"He was a kid."
"No, no, I understand."
"Everyone here."
"Not for real."
"Yes, she is pretty."
"It was so good."
"This is your world."
"To be with you."
"When it's over."
"It's beautiful outside."
"How did you say?"
"Judge for yourself."
"Why are you coming here?"
"Do you want to touch me?"
"It's all black."
"I have already won."
"Fruit juice?"
"It comes back to me now."
"No, it's clear."
"Give me a few days."
"I will come back tomorrow morning."
"Your friends are here."
"We took it."
"I have a word."
"You sound like him."
"Welcome to the island."
"My parents are here."
"That's a good find."
"Do you have friends?"
"And me too."
"Fix it a little."
"It's hot there."
"Blessed be the fruit."
"You can wait here."
"Go on, have fun."
"I can't find them."
"I'll take the bus."
"We are at the table."
"That was his plan."
"It's noise."
"But is it true?"
"He was so small."
"She lives next door."
"It's really fascinating."
"What do women want?"
"No, on this side."
"Where are the soldiers?"
"Let's go, right?"
"How are you down there?"
"You are the last one."
"No, not at first."
"I have a result."
"No, but I do."
"Do you want a blanket?"
"I thought I was."
"Why did you look?"
"I am an American."
"I love this girl."
"Give us a chance."
"Something wonderful."
"Who will you believe?"
"What kind of photos?"
"Who brought him?"
"Would you really do it?"
"So good?"
"Don't ask me that."
"Why do you love me?"
"He is seven years old."
"You have to think about it."
"I was over the moon."
"A man like me?"
"You must know him."
"He has children."
"Shall we play cards?"
"How are you, my dear?"
"I found better."
"I will explain everything to you."
"I think I know where."
"You have to be there."
"That's easy to say."
"They found her."
"You don't drink anything?"
"This is my method."
"Who saw it?"
"How could that be?"
"It's never easy."
"This is my garden."
"He's super cool."
"This is my project."
"We'll go home."
"Show me your shoulder."
"I will never forgive you."
"You need to get treatment."
"And how much does it cost?"
"Put it on the ground."
"Who organized this?"
"They always do that."
"And what does it say?"
"We'll talk tomorrow morning."
"Were you looking for something?"
"Can someone explain to me?"
"It's all for you."
"Someone for you."
"Have we seen you?"
"N.J. Turnpike"
"I'm a regular."
"Yes, I succeeded."
"You have balls."
"It depends on who it is."
"It was implied."
"Next left."
"Whatever you do."
"Have you tried it?"
"We can hide."
"Are you going to answer me?"
"But to go where?"
"Hey, where are you?"
"Life is long."
"Missile still approaching."
"Where is the box?"
"Are you offering it to me?"
"Is everything okay, doctor?"
"Where can we talk?"
"I was with you."
"I would have said yes."
"That was my case."
"A fairy tale."
"We offer it to you."
"It's my night."
"And they know it."
"You must be starving."
"I know, my heart."
"It's a journey."
"It goes further."
"He just passed by."
"See you later, buddy."
"He found us."
"You'll have it tomorrow."
"I already answered."
"Our decision is made."
"I can accept it."
"I am a specialist."
"I have some savings."
"The news is good."
"I am your queen."
"Just drive."
"You can withdraw."
"He is my brother."
"You must be cold."
"If it helps."
"You are a legend."
"I will repay you."
"I don't do drugs."
"But it was good."
"It's a blue."
"The man of the day."
"It happened again."
"Thank you for listening to me."
"I would like to rest."
"You're used to it."
"This is super important."
"I will miss them."
"Yes, I would like that."
"Do you have any clients?"
"What is the solution?"
"May God hear you."
"They are beautiful, aren't they?"
"It's a head."
"My father died."
"There you go, you know everything."
"And you, my dear?"
"Did you hear them?"
"Because it works."
"I will come with you."
"I am the manager."
"You smell very good."
"Give me a phone."
"How much did you get?"
"I withdrew."
"It's you again."
"Do you see the light?"
"He is making an effort."
"Three deposits tonight."
"Bigger than what?"
"We'll bring him back."
"I want this role."
"That's your business."
"Not one more."
"You're not going up?"
"Is it warm enough?"
"What is the rating?"
"Drink plenty of water."
"Well, I'm fine."
"I appreciate the offer."
"Was he your husband?"
"It was a deal."
"He's our guy."
"I didn't follow."
"She couldn't."
"I like her."
"It's going to be okay, son."
"Nothing very important."
"I'm always serious."
"My name is Tim."
"Do you know the latest one?"
"Here's how it works."
"You've changed so much."
"I have the papers."
"They are waiting for my order."
"I'll work on it."
"It's a reality."
"I can explain that."
"Where is she then?"
"It's really hot."
"What were you doing before?"
"A very good friend."
"Wherever it is."
"Victory was near."
"Who else knew?"
"I will convince him."
"How far will you go?"
"What was I talking about?"
"Then I understood."
"How would that be possible?"
"The evidence is there."
"And other things."
"They are coming for us."
"I know all this."
"This one is pretty."
"I have a doctorate."
"Come here for a moment."
"Do you have a microphone?"
"What should he do?"
"This is perfect timing."
"Would you agree?"
"Madam, can you hear me?"
"Mom, is everything okay?"
"One minute, one minute."
"I understand your reaction."
"My compliments to the chef."
"You are a pearl."
"She'll do."
"Do you have any paper?"
"This is my invention."
"Where is my truck?"
"My father's."
"Did you go back?"
"Show me your eyes."
"He's a regular."
"Have you changed?"
"They are coming towards us."
"I would love to go there."
"And I meant it."
"She's super hot."
"I know her."
"Calm down, my dear."
"There, there and there."
"It was the right one."
"Would you tell me?"
"Do you have a towel?"
"What do you want then?"
"Welcome to the jungle."
"This is our road."
"Is she seeing someone?"
"Come and see over there."
"Both are fine with me."
"Where is my card?"
"That was almost it."
"We have a market."
"Bring him over here."
"And how do we do it?"
"But I know him."
"Go there first."
"Promise me you'll come back."
"We do this together."
"I was acquitted."
"You get noticed."
"It's more efficient."
"The operation is canceled."
"How are you, Dad?"
"How is your husband?"
"She wrote to me."
"You are our hero."
"What kind of deal?"
"Thank you and have a nice day."
"My reputation precedes me."
"With all my love."
"From all over the place."
"This is the entrance."
"It happens to me sometimes."
"I can't now."
"I will pay attention to it."
"Yeah, here we go."
"She will tell you."
"Let me drive you home."
"And the other part?"
"I see his face."
"I expect it."
"Do you have a first name?"
"Did you look carefully?"
"This is my group."
"She was poisoned."
"I'm going to hang up now."
"Did you have any?"
"The bets are on."
"Who do we start with?"
"Archer to T'Pol."
"If I have what?"
"Everyone loves it."
"He's a character."
"I loved your father."
"Pour us a drink."
"Don't believe her."
"I admire your passion."
"What were they doing here?"
"I'll be upstairs."
"You can sleep peacefully."
"I am a Cylon."
"Morning, noon and night."
"I know very well."
"Yeah, all the time."
"One point for me."
"They are ghosts."
"Good luck, my boy."
"He really loves you."
"A little light."
"In a short time."
"We'll ask him."
"Who was on the phone?"
"Everything is for sale."
"It's quite surprising."
"Are you on duty?"
"Do you work for them?"
"I love your breasts."
"When I was young."
"I can't do it right now."
"Do you have a lighter?"
"It looks like a dog."
"End of scene."
"He'll get used to it."
"What's up, boss?"
"It must be awesome."
"Do you want a Coke?"
"I was so happy."
"They're good, aren't they?"
"I'm going right."
"Do you take sugar?"
"I'm going to examine you."
"How could he have?"
"Say what to whom?"
"I improved it."
"Are your men ready?"
"I introduced myself."
"Your ID?"
"Are you cooking?"
"That's right, yeah."
"Four or five hours."
"Nobody deserves it."
"Where is my book?"
"It's prettier."
"The sons of bitches."
"It's really fun."
"It seems normal to me."
"Do you have a receipt?"
"He is a handsome boy."
"Can you pass it to me?"
"It's very ingenious."
"We need to think about it."
"Can we see them?"
"She is really talented."
"Do you know this story?"
"Training is over."
"Want details?"
"Do you want fries?"
"She is in surgery."
"I was a kid."
"Right, girls?"
"Go there yourself."
"I hear noise."
"I wouldn't know."
"I want my wife."
"It's a laptop."
"A telegram for you."
"A week or two."
"Do you recognize anything?"
"So keep your secrets."
"It's a radio."
"Did they find him?"
"Here are two more."
"Everything is different now."
"You're all red."
"I want an apology."
"A little late, isn't it?"
"As you wish, sir."
"Yes, they do."
"Yes, we were waiting for you."
"It's very stimulating."
"He agreed."
"He was so cute."
"Is this your handwriting?"
"It looks like a baby."
"He got up."
"No one called."
"Another satisfied customer."
"He is behind you."
"You sold me out."
"I have to protect you."
"Do as usual."
"This is a quote."
"I'm fine, yes."
"So go home."
"What is the treatment?"
"How do I get out of here?"
"He is at the office."
"I'm selling the house."
"Should I believe you?"
"I'm going to Paris."
"Is this a sandwich?"
"This interview is over."
"You are in mourning."
"So, that's perfect."
"We broke up."
"It's beyond my skills."
"I betrayed you."
"When will it be ready?"
"What kind of boat?"
"You said it all."
"You're right, sorry."
"We're having a good laugh."
"I could be."
"It's Grandma."
"It's his party."
"I have a source."
"We can start now."
"I will be happy."
"I don't recognize you anymore."
"In a word, yes."
"He is quite right."
"It's very comforting."
"How do I find it?"
"Can we do it again?"
"Only two months left."
"I will make an effort."
"Shall we go to dinner?"
"But here's the thing."
"I'm celebrating."
"We just moved in."
"Second door on the right."
"Fresh meat."
"We have to stay here."
"You are the king."
"This is the room."
"Out of town."
"You too, I hope."
"Thank you for your participation."
"When it's all over."
"I like this plan."
"Go home, madam."
"And I thought."
"I take the keys."
"I think about it, yes."
"I raised him."
"How is your knee?"
"That was my goal."
"I take the money."
"Yes, I understand you."
"Everything's fine, huh?"
"I really like her."
"What was I supposed to say?"
"You do it like this."
"She's like you."
"Shall I wrap it for you?"
"You have been."
"That's the title."
"Finally, we meet."
"My dear, are you okay?"
"It was great, wasn't it?"
"Yes, I hear it."
"It can't."
"You imagine things."
"You can take them."
"I think it's beautiful."
"And I want it."
"Don't get too excited."
"What do we have left?"
"Where is she, Mom?"
"Next to me."
"In one piece."
"He wrote to me."
"Where is the senator?"
"Yes, I see you."
"It's like before."
"It works pretty well."
"We eat well there."
"How to do it?"
"Where is the mayor?"
"I have to bring her back."
"She's somewhere."
"They all came."
"Do you like birds?"
"It must be great."
"It's his heart."
"It was the first."
"It's a whole."
"Don't answer him."
"Caught in the act."
"It's been six years."
"We're going to clean this up."
"Gentlemen, thank you."
"It's a competition."
"It's really easy."
"So we will meet again."
"We need to discuss this."
"My mother's."
"Yes, as usual."
"I'm the only one."
"You're a leader."
"It's mom's."
"Send me the address."
"Are you on guard duty?"
"It was really cool."
"She worked for me."
"The light is green."
"I can wear it."
"Sword plate activated."
"No, I want it."
"Nobody saw it."
"It would be easier."
"She is very shy."
"She is in bed."
"I'm leaving the group."
"Don't come back here."
"Are there any more?"
"No one is perfect."
"It's their business."
"He worked for me."
"Three times a week."
"Thank you for inviting me."
"It's more serious."
"It's metal."
"Nobody is looking at us."
"Are you dreaming or what?"
"The house is spotless."
"Any luck?"
"I wanted to introduce myself."
"This is the address."
"Just listen."
"Well, I thought so."
"You are very young."
"She saw us."
"Do you want a pen?"
"Welcome to the building."
"I will stop them."
"I knew him well."
"I lived there."
"Just one last thing."
"What size are you?"
"I walk with you."
"It will be done, my lord."
"You would like that, wouldn't you?"
"Honey, where are you?"
"I really have to go home."
"That remains to be proven."
"Yes, it's interesting."
"Do you want to go to dinner?"
"Like so many others."
"I no longer exist."
"There you go, that's perfect."
"We can always hope."
"She is our friend."
"She is expecting a child."
"Put on some music."
"I have a rule."
"They are found everywhere."
"Our time has come."
"There are more of them."
"It's not sexy."
"I like your smell."
"Good luck, my dear."
"This way, I think."
"Give me more."
"Yes, in the kitchen."
"And the little girl?"
"Every last penny."
"For helping me."
"You don't love anyone."
"You've got guts."
"One thing escapes me."
"Everyone, listen up."
"I'm going to love this."
"My name is James."
"I'll follow her."
"Thank you for participating."
"My phone number."
"I take classes."
"We are a group."
"I love your mother."
"Good afternoon, ladies."
"Is this a fact?"
"Think about your son."
"To tell me what?"
"Did I do it?"
"It's the light."
"This is my restaurant."
"Hold his hand."
"You're not sure?"
"She will change her mind."
"I had to improvise."
"I open my eyes."
"I take the top."
"Let's go to the living room."
"Thanks for the walk."
"This is the real one."
"Do you have a joint?"
"But what are they doing?"
"That's his role."
"I can still hear it."
"I never know."
"Just a second, guys."
"Wait, don't go."
"An engagement ring?"
"I find it romantic."
"I have to be there."
"I will be at home."
"You don't have anyone?"
"When I was a kid."
"I'll pay you tomorrow."
"He stays with me."
"Are you from the neighborhood?"
"We saw each other."
"The signal is good."
"I forgave him."
"I turn off the light."
"More beautiful than ever."
"Everyone will understand."
"That's an argument."
"She can do anything."
"Yes, we have some."
"Where are you, darling?"
"What are you asking me?"
"It happens to the best of us."
"Why this sudden interest?"
"Where is the head?"
"Have you made your decision?"
"Very well, I accept."
"But I succeeded."
"He was with her."
"How's your nose?"
"Do you love your father?"
"Someone is waiting for me."
"Don't write that."
"You impressed me."
"Go get your father."
"She takes care of it."
"It has just begun."
"You liked him."
"We must be patient."
"Do you have a beer?"
"This is my condition."
"Leave him alone."
"Yeah, it's going well."
"I'll have it tomorrow."
"I only have you."
"I married you."
"The world is vast."
"Do you want to marry her?"
"He's holding something."
"It's a tunnel."
"How much did you pay?"
"What was needed."
"That's fair enough."
"We receive a signal."
"I said thank you."
"Yes, just a second."
"And where am I going?"
"She's your aunt."
"And that's important."
"Ah, no, no, no."
"I will be behind you."
"I'm telling a story."
"Are you writing a book?"
"Our paths separate."
"What is their plan?"
"It's the altitude."
"It's pretty impressive."
"It leaves me perplexed."
"Thank you for your childhood."
"You can tell him."
"I like to live dangerously."
"I'm talking about him."
"The Wizard of Oz."
"Were you having an affair?"
"They followed me."
"I wish I had some."
"I love the view."
"I'm a lead."
"Your life depends on it."
"I was helped."
"It ends here."
"I asked for it."
"This is your future."
"Pass me a cigarette."
"This is our captain."
"I peed."
"You know the truth."
"He is very famous."
"This is the police station."
"It's going on."
"She wants something."
"I'll keep an eye on her."
"How did you succeed?"
"This is my wish."
"Didn't you notice?"
"No need for more."
"Where are you then?"
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"You have two options."
"I love this dress."
"It's okay, man."
"We are his parents."
"You have to open it."
"Someone important."
"Of many things."
"Do you have a list?"
"So much the better, so much the better."
"Where are the horses?"
"I'm going to take my leave."
"They must be punished."
"It was fun, wasn't it?"
"It's a birthday."
"Take him home."
"The coffee is good."
"I was patient."
"And other stuff."
"What do you mean, you're leaving?"
"I asked you."
"She is early."
"See you this afternoon."
"A phone call."
"Are these your parents?"
"This is my editor."
"I was careful."
"I'm going to have to go."
"He was my patient."
"You will find someone."
"This is the boy."
"Which reminds me."
"They are foreigners."
"They are parasites."
"Let's go see a movie."
"We can do business."
"We are the first."
"I want to be me."
"Don't look down."
"It's going to be amazing."
"Do you want my seat?"
"Thank you for supporting me."
"Are you going now?"
"Yes, I'm interested."
"I have two sons."
"What kind of friend?"
"A little something."
"When is it from?"
"It's even better."
"And you like it?"
"Give me the towel."
"We have to stop everything."
"How could they?"
"I was unfair."
"It's going to be okay, Dad."
"We are a couple."
"I repeat the question."
"Yes, we are there."
"Yes, we know each other."
"I'll see about that tomorrow."
"Do you want to tell them?"
"Why do you have it?"
"You have to admit it."
"Is that legal?"
"Oh, as usual."
"You will have your chance."
"I raise my glass."
"I can take you."
"Did we follow you?"
"Yeah, she's fine."
"It was the other one."
"If I can do it."
"Do you want to go see?"
"It was canceled."
"It's behind us."
"He's almost finished."
"That's my nickname."
"I'll do the same."
"Wake up, old man."
"I live nearby."
"It's so sweet."
"It's written on it."
"I'm going up to bed."
"My answer is yes."
"How do we find it?"
"I had to talk to you."
"It's an invasion."
"That's all, thanks."
"Will you be able to behave?"
"I am a gamer."
"Where are the cars?"
"He was a gentleman."
"I'm going to have fun."
"And she is beautiful."
"Pass me a towel."
"About half an hour."
"So, are you going?"
"Oh, yes, I know."
"Make me a promise."
"Pass me the towel."
"He was very good."
"It's a sum."
"We're a team, right?"
"Can I go back to work?"
"I had a friend."
"That's the order."
"We will let you know."
"He had a choice."
"He says yes."
"I love this one."
"Don't even dare."
"I looked carefully."
"What size is it?"
"Is it that fast?"
"But I thank you."
"Do you want a sip?"
"I sell insurance."
"He's a copycat."
"They are so young."
"And it's free."
"We are his friends."
"The bank is closed."
"This is our city."
"Nothing is written."
"May I ask a question?"
"How will it end?"
"She has your eyes."
"I'm leaving with them."
"He has the profile."
"In police custody."
"Someone is waiting for you."
"You're a star."
"This is my land."
"It's very special."
"It will be like before."
"She won't do anything."
"I've been attacked."
"Who drew this?"
"I make tea."
"It's a maze."
"This is really good."
"It's an advance."
"Yeah, it was good."
"I know your son."
"Can I do it again?"
"Hence my call."
"I like water."
"So here we are."
"I prepared myself."
"You mean me?"
"The gate is open."
"Good evening how are you?"
"What music do you like?"
"I taught him."
"We passed it."
"You got it all."
"Don't wake her up."
"You should let it go."
"What did you want to do?"
"He's our friend."
"They liked it."
"He's a clown."
"I just checked."
"I have the cable."
"I wrote to him."
"We have an idea."
"I can do more."
"Lowering the solar filter."
"Will you give it back to me?"
"No, I'm sincere."
"We always do it."
"Aren't you thirsty?"
"Move your big toe."
"Are you the boxer?"
"We'll take care of that."
"Let him have fun."
"It's a detonator."
"I like trains."
"Not the right time?"
"I just wanted to talk."
"You are a friend."
"This is your gift."
"Tell me your story."
"He works with me."
"To make up for it."
"Where is the hammer?"
"He's a big name."
"I was at my wit's end."
"She is doing well."
"I believed her."
"You are really good."
"They saw it."
"You had to be there."
"Anything to declare?"
"That's the good news."
"Our work is done."
"This can't go on any longer."
"Let's go, buddy."
"He is our brother."
"Get yourself a job."
"Good night, you two."
"Who are you dating?"
"Pretty good, actually."
"How much for everything?"
"It was a bet."
"Thank her for me."
"I will always love him."
"It seemed so real."
"I like your dress."
"Congratulations to both of you."
"Whatever you want, man."
"I take my car."
"Because I know."
"I looked for her."
"Thank you for intervening."
"She is taking a bath."
"This is that door."
"Don't you want to stay?"
"Do you know the story?"
"And mine too."
"It's done now."
"He had his reasons."
"Go back to your country."
"He's an alcoholic."
"There are two of us then."
"I have two questions."
"I took some."
"It depends on her."
"The constants are stable."
"You can't what?"
"May God forgive you."
"Not like the others."
"It's July."
"At the battle station."
"I'm going to make some."
"This is my task."
"It's frowned upon."
"I see it everywhere."
"It's live."
"Right on cue."
"Everything will be fine, Mom."
"Whose house is it?"
"I'm taking a walk."
"What do you hope to find?"
"I'm coming to get him."
"No, thanks to you."
"Yes, very good, thank you."
"Because of him?"
"I love this kitchen."
"But listen to me carefully."
"We have to decide."
"Your hair looks beautiful."
"Things got out of hand."
"Everyone sings."
"We're going to rest."
"She's my roommate."
"Are you sleeping or what?"
"That's right, man."
"It's a grave."
"Does she have someone?"
"This is my business."
"As much as it takes."
"Did you hear it?"
"I will explain everything."
"It's a list."
"I worked a lot."
"We have a rhythm."
"It's the medication."
"This boy is right."
"Can you all hear me?"
"I will be very careful."
"We have a past."
"It's pitch black."
"It's a documentary."
"It's very relaxing."
"You chose it."
"Give us your news."
"We have to get started."
"Did he kiss you?"
"I managed."
"Something better."
"It's his voice."
"We like each other."
"I live right there."
"Her name is Nancy."
"Last weekend."
"Tell me your name again."
"Is this a coincidence?"
"You don't have it?"
"I dreamed it."
"You have a chance."
"It's very powerful."
"Next time, then."
"It was very clear."
"How much do we have left?"
"I'll tell you tomorrow."
"Yes, he is handsome."
"I'll see her tomorrow."
"For quite a while now."
"That you love me."
"Everyone has their reasons."
"I got up."
"She was on the ground."
"Finally home."
"What do we tell him?"
"Everything is going perfectly well."
"Give me the Ring."
"Can you explain it?"
"My name is Allison."
"Are you on treatment?"
"Heaven on earth."
"My wife is going to give birth."
"I want to be sure."
"They're almost there."
"You abandoned us."
"I love flowers."
"It's not professional."
"It was a good try."
"See you tonight then."
"What can happen?"
"Sorry, it's me."
"Please accept my apologies."
"That's the theory."
"If you want, yes."
"We'll see each other tomorrow."
"She's his girlfriend."
"Yes, it's the same."
"Are you a girl?"
"How much did we make?"
"Honey, it's going to be okay."
"Could you do that?"
"He's going to be fine."
"Is this your cell?"
"You are one."
"I am the witness."
"She means well."
"This is his story."
"Do you really want to continue?"
"I want to watch it."
"That means a lot."
"You are monsters."
"Mr. Prime Minister."
"It's a comedy."
"He has everything planned."
"There was a crowd."
"You are like him."
"Have you seen each other?"
"He is an acquaintance."
"What is the frequency?"
"Thousands dead."
"His mother died."
"Welcome to the world."
"You should meet him."
"In my opinion, yes."
"I'm not hiding."
"But I was there."
"Duty calls us."
"I take the subway."
"It's very fast."
"Where is it hidden?"
"Do you like sports?"
"It might last."
"Do you have any information?"
"It's already decided."
"This is their territory."
"There are a few drops left."
"I'm at my maximum."
"Whose name?"
"I was talking to myself."
"It's water."
"That's the whole thing."
"Everything is going so fast."
"I hired you."
"It was very strong."
"What are the conditions?"
"I want my family."
"I did some."
"He is my family."
"I am always kind."
"I'm always kind."
"If I may say so."
"Yes, anything."
"It's a diamond."
"It's a clock."
"We will do it together."
"My God, forgive me."
"But you love him."
"I have medication."
"There are thousands of them."
"It's a swan."
"I have hair."
"Maybe tonight."
"She begged me."
"What do they call it?"
"You might think so."
"And who is she?"
"Oh, he's gorgeous."
"It's volunteer work."
"Only you can."
"They are with us."
"It's classified."
"It has to work."
"They have my daughter."
"Do you want money?"
"This is your target."
"Do you want anything else?"
"It must be evacuated."
"He is doing well."
"Which one is yours?"
"Only life matters."
"It's a butterfly."
"We had a good laugh."
"Yeah, he's fine."
"You're not possible."
"The children are here."
"It was really fun."
"What do you look like?"
"I'm going to the supermarket."
"You disobeyed me."
"This is a suggestion."
"My mother is waiting for me."
"You can thank me."
"Nobody listens to us."
"Something different."
"I'll send them to you."
"It's somewhere."
"Where is the house?"
"You have to focus."
"He's having a fit."
"What do you want to see?"
"Thanks for sharing."
"I have a pencil."
"They are mercenaries."
"Come a little closer."
"You should like it."
"Oh, everything's fine."
"It was very cute."
"It's so true."
"I am the husband."
"I'm handling the situation."
"We have a story."
"What we do."
"Don't read this."
"I want your happiness."
"Now it's me."
"Through the front door."
"We are grateful to you."
"The roof is broken."
"Enough about the King."
"It amuses you, huh?"
"I was sitting there."
"Go home quickly."
"Any calls for me?"
"Am I early?"
"I will go with him."
"I have a prescription."
"Where is your captain?"
"Your rooms are ready."
"We are at my house."
"Did you eat well?"
"Do you want to swim?"
"I took it out."
"Sorry about your friend."
"She's a spy."
"I love gifts."
"Do you want to train?"
"I have the right to it."
"Thanks for the sandwich."
"Isn't he handsome?"
"It was the opposite."
"Hi, what are you doing?"
"Did I say it?"
"You should do this."
"And he will."
"She found it."
"Let's calm down."
"Are you in position?"
"Where were you yesterday?"
"Are you leaving town?"
"No, it's cute."
"It will be a piece of cake."
"Only two minutes left."
"I love your shoes."
"Yes, what do you want?"
"He helped us."
"We are in public."
"I'm so thirsty."
"Put it in there."
"You are a smart guy."
"We are heroes."
"They get along well."
"Thank you very much, goodbye."
"Can we let it go?"
"Can you catch it?"
"Do you want my advice?"
"What should I answer?"
"I'm leaving the country."
"We were good together."
"Come on, open your mouth."
"Are you working tonight?"
"I locked him up."
"Can I get it back?"
"Have a great summer."
"You play very well."
"He has power."
"That was the end."
"Thank you, I'm fine."
"It's the nerves."
"I want to hear them."
"No, it is."
"I inherited it."
"He's really cool."
"This is our target."
"Thank you, you are kind."
"That suits me too."
"Did you eat it?"
"Nothing is simple."
"What did your father do?"
"Who is responsible for this?"
"Ask my mother."
"And the other thing?"
"You guys were awesome."
"Where are they then?"
"Where are the parents?"
"I will call you back."
"It's a raid."
"We need to call the cops."
"I'm going to calm down."
"I'll go look outside."
"How are we going to get in?"
"We can have them."
"It's so much fun."
"We're shooting a movie."
"I rented it."
"He has a job."
"I'll call him back."
"What is their purpose?"
"You were with him."
"You have it now."
"It's your thing."
"He is a dentist."
"The shop is closed."
"Where could she be?"
"He is very pleasant."
"If he wants to."
"Accident, if you will."
"You're welcome, you're welcome."
"I have the signal."
"Call the first witness."
"Do you like wine?"
"It's quite tricky."
"It's just you."
"Do you want your money?"
"They come in here sometimes."
"Maybe not everything."
"Someone might come in."
"It's more fun."
"Thanks for the ice cream."
"I'll let you decide."
"He cheated on me."
"Give me that rifle."
"But not for that."
"The prosecution has finished."
"She's really great."
"Yes, I understand that."
"Did you find any?"
"It's better to go home."
"Good luck, my love."
"One of ours?"
"You see, my little one?"
"And all his possessions."
"We have a lot of fun."
"Not every night."
"Make room for me."
"My tomato burst."
"I'm going to Harvard."
"She had her reasons."
"You owe him allegiance."
"Not enough time."
"That's what it's for."
"They are at my house."
"This gift is rare."
"Too few came."
"You're going to crash."
"He is on the move."
"Go to your place."
"I like coffee."
"Both are good."
"So, have you decided?"
"I have a delivery."
"Which one do you start with?"
"No one will know anything."
"Next right."
"Do you want breakfast?"
"This place is huge."
"Look at all these people."
"You may think so."
"The head came out."
"Okay, that's fine with me."
"What he wants."
"It's an asset."
"Your car is waiting for you."
"If I had it?"
"She's getting married tomorrow."
"I'm going to meet him."
"She must have forgotten."
"Sure, mate."
"I take the train."
"And what do I say?"
"Your name, little lady?"
"We have the proof."
"He has an attack."
"Can I interview you?"
"Uh, you know what?"
"May I be so bold?"
"Is your project still on?"
"He had work."
"I love this man."
"We're at the top."
"Not here, not now."
"Bend down a little."
"Is that all, sir?"
"I don't answer."
"Are you one?"
"Do you know how to drive this?"
"Nor ever in advance."
"Give him something."
"I withdraw the question."
"Where is this man?"
"They were murdered."
"Are you satisfied with this?"
"He had one."
"His name is Connor."
"It's autumn."
"Including our guy?"
"I am a romantic."
"It's a quick one."
"Yeah, what's up?"
"I work like this."
"You're going strong."
"Thank you for seeing me."
"I just wanted to try."
"How it's pronounced."
"Peanut butter."
"We're going to separate."
"You were very good."
"How are you, Tony?"
"The door was locked."
"When are we doing this?"
"Lunch time."
"It's up to you to find out."
"Where does this door lead?"
"We still are."
"Your wife is waiting for you."
"It's an intervention."
"I'm undercover."
"And who is he?"
"It's going to be day."
"Do you play poker?"
"How do I know that?"
"He is a saint."
"Will you kiss me?"
"She is in a meeting."
"Hi, where are you?"
"We're going to camp here."
"He was your friend."
"Where is the picture?"
"Are you going to play it?"
"Can we eat it?"
"It's really extraordinary."
"You don't know how to drive?"
"Do you want your share?"
"I am a fighter."
"I wouldn't want to."
"Where is the guard?"
"Is that Brett?"
"We have to focus."
"Can you sign this?"
"This is my watch."
"I could go there."
"Duty above all."
"She is in Paris."
"My sword is yours."
"And you are."
"You have to know that."
"It's lighter."
"This is my jacket."
"Where are the papers?"
"What is the date?"
"I was getting some fresh air."
"Day by day."
"Who authorized it?"
"Is Vincent Vega here?"
"I'm your friend."
"And he loves you."
"You'll see that."
"I like this word."
"Hey, it's going to be okay."
"I was sixteen years old."
"See you another time."
"Is this really him?"
"I closed it."
"This is that woman."
"Of course, I can."
"Pass me one."
"Including our dreams."
"I'm writing a novel."
"Find another one."
"I'll make a note of that."
"She stays with us."
"You are Vincent."
"They are amateurs."
"Where is the bar?"
"Yeah, that's better."
"So where is it?"
"Can you see that?"
"So why do it?"
"He tells me everything."
"He turned around."
"It feels like a dream."
"I'll take the train."
"The one you want."
"This is our market."
"What do I feel?"
"This is the man."
"They saw everything."
"Neither women nor children."
"He does his job."
"I want my freedom."
"You have school tomorrow."
"I'm keeping watch."
"Do you want to tell me?"
"Is he your lover?"
"They are police officers."
"I need to calm down."
"Is this the end?"
"Fingerprint identification, please."
"They like me."
"He is a handsome man."
"He was held back."
"No one should enter."
"I work at night."
"You're going to have to leave."
"She knows my name."
"What about a Big Mac?"
"Have we identified him?"
"Do you want a baby?"
"When you grow up."
"Yes, but still."
"I would be grateful."
"Where is the third one?"
"By making me cum?"
"That was me."
"She's your cousin."
"She is coming towards us."
"I will report it."
"It's me, man."
"I'm the good guy."
"The return journey."
"Thanks for the water."
"Exactly the same thing."
"Thank you, Officer."
"Go see your father."
"What are you coming for?"
"You must follow us."
"Both of you be careful."
"You can handle this."
"I have given enough."
"Among many others."
"Whose honor?"
"The witness may answer."
"I parked."
"It's his favorite."
"How does he know that?"
"Goodbye, Grandpa."
"Dances with Wolves."
"It was an idea."
"From when?"
"It's a castle."
"Do I believe it?"
"Tomorrow at dawn."
"She found me."
"Do you have a verdict?"
"One or two weeks."
"Is he okay?"
"All over the world."
"Which hospital is this?"
"How dare she?"
"I finally meet you."
"Are you the husband?"
"In the name of God."
"You have a good heart."
"They are all here."
"Just be yourself."
"We have the advantage."
"Like this, my chick?"
"I do it to myself."
"I want to be honest."
"But it's beautiful."
"We need to get organized."
"With ice?"
"It's a blast."
"Not after all that."
"He married her."
"This is very encouraging."
"I find that unfair."
"I will keep you informed."
"It's a spell."
"He is in high school."
"I should apologize."
"Yes, we are friends."
"I accept the offer."
"No, I'm hungry."
"I love this book."
"Who are the parents?"
"And all this why?"
"As you know."
"The sky is clear."
"You never go out."
"It's quite serious."
"Go ahead, ask him."
"What kind of ideas?"
"They released him."
"They came in large numbers."
"My name is Billy."
"I'll take the couch."
"What is the signal?"
"Go see your daughter."
"This is my priority."
"Specialty of the house."
"I still think so."
"No one survived."
"My name is Angel."
"The CIA?"
"He's talking about me."
"It was summer."
"I am a legend."
"Thanks for checking."
"That's super nice."
"How are you boys?"
"They will know what to do."
"That's saying a lot."
"And take him where?"
"She's probably right."
"What could be more normal?"
"We have a child."
"We succeeded together."
"Find out who it is."
"You know the monsters."
"Is there a difference?"
"This is my costume."
"And is it serious?"
"Is there a place left?"
"Give me the letter."
"The situation is beyond our control."
"Everything's fine, son."
"I'm doing the dishes."
"I will have the money."
"I will wait for your call."
"Put your hand here."
"So where are they?"
"Can I get rid of you?"
"But they are there."
"Very well, good night."
"What do you believe in?"
"He's your fiancé."
"It's a network."
"It was so easy."
"Are you in Paris?"
"I'll hold it."
"I do my best."
"Everyone is talking."
"I will answer you."
"We will be heroes."
"We all loved him."
"Where are the tapes?"
"Can we take him?"
"What should you do?"
"Give yourself time."
"I'm on my own."
"I'm looking for a book."
"I will always protect you."
"I am a messenger."
"What is he saying?"
"Of course, my darling."
"The target moves."
"Yes, you are right."
"We can hear you."
"You'll know tomorrow."
"Duty calls."
"They don't work."
"Are you down there?"
"Yes, it's fantastic."
"Will you tell him why?"
"I was looking for work."
"Did he talk about it?"
"Thanks anyway."
"They will treat you."
"Don't answer me."
"Are you going that way?"
"You like that, don't you?"
"Count to three."
"Well, he was."
"Shall we have lunch together tomorrow?"
"Let me see you."
"It's a set."
"A hunting accident."
"This is your patient."
"He's a snitch."
"I will abstain."
"Say it with me."
"Something has moved."
"Where are his things?"
"My name is Carrie."
"Go get a doctor."
"She was very kind."
"Yes, what else?"
"It would be a miracle."
"I'll let you think about it."
"We should listen to him."
"The light is on."
"Yes, that was it."
"You set me free."
"Before I was a knight."
"One man, two women."
"I would have seen it."
"It has its advantages."
"He worked for us."
"I want my father."
"I love being here."
"I have to sort this out."
"Red leather, yellow leather."
"If I know what?"
"Yeah, yeah, sure."
"Go back to your mother."
"You are a pro."
"I would like your opinion."
"Let me introduce you to Raquel."
"All of this is true."
"Wait, wait a minute."
"I have to warn them."
"We abandoned them."
"Will you be able to remain loyal?"
"You have red."
"You have two choices."
"What did it look like?"
"I'll take your place."
"Your eyelids are heavy."
"But this was different."
"The orders have changed."
"He's coming towards you."
"You are very perceptive."
"He is four years old."
"There you are right."
"Do they treat you well?"
"You can say no."
"That's my answer."
"I'll take this side."
"Go to the police."
"He is in order."
"It's his head."
"Do you look like a chick?"
"It will make me happy."
"Thanks for the whiskey."
"We've got everything planned."
"Come see for yourself."
"So where have you been?"
"He marks his territory."
"Thanks for the cigarette."
"I would like to meet them."
"And not the least."
"It was hers."
"Any more good news?"
"Are you thinking of giving up?"
"I am in front of you."
"Carrie, it's Quinn."
"Three or four years."
"Good luck, girls."
"So it was you."
"This is more important."
"You, that's all."
"It will never end."
"She is very small."
"The doors are open."
"Without saying goodbye?"
"I'll leave first."
"Give me the check."
"What, in the belly?"
"It must be protected."
"That's him, man."
"You must stay calm."
"Come with me then."
"I left it."
"I just got out."
"And the other night?"
"Warn everyone."
"I believed in you."
"We are all human."
"We talked a lot."
"Are you coming to see me?"
"He was transferred."
"This is evolution."
"Take him to the station."
"He loves children."
"That was my name."
"The cops came."
"I picked it up."
"Are you aware of this?"
"Nobody notices."
"What kind of surprise?"
"I ate some."
"But we have to go."
"This is an estimate."
"The pleasure is shared."
"Everything's fine, right?"
"Maybe I'll drop by."
"Do you want sugar?"
"You are my savior."
"What if I kept it?"
"I can do without it."
"Is that your excuse?"
"Give me my phone."
"I like blue."
"She's my neighbor."
"Is she okay?"
"You can go out now."
"I change my vote."
"The facts are there."
"You can rest assured."
"Am I pronouncing it correctly?"
"He still goes there."
"We saw that."
"This is my dinner."
"I have an apartment."
"A clean cup."
"I strum the bass."
"He is eight years old."
"Follow me, guys."
"And one, two, three."
"We will stay in touch."
"Nothing is easy."
"And there he is."
"What is at stake?"
"Nothing here either."
"I see one."
"I'm going to join him."
"I would like a coffee."
"I am the Count."
"The doctor is waiting for you."
"How are you over there?"
"Are you still up?"
"There is a scale."
"Will you show me around?"
"Who was it for?"
"Let's not think about it."
"No, it's there."
"I am a cat."
"It's a sport."
"I don't have to."
"He doesn't answer anymore."
"I'll go get her."
"Is he mine?"
"A picture of you."
"Do you see this car?"
"You'll find out."
"What is their story?"
"Who helped you?"
"But it's nice."
"Thank you for saying that."
"What if it works?"
"Mom, what is it?"
"And we will see them."
"She is really nice."
"The car is in front."
"Nothing matters anymore."
"That's understandable, right?"
"I have a buyer."
"Can I play with it?"
"Do you read the newspapers?"
"It's so sexy."
"You must be Elena."
"The discussion is over."
"How do we turn this off?"
"Maybe, maybe."
"One, two, one, two."
"It's by invitation."
"You have a client."
"Go to bed now."
"Is this the register?"
"Who wants some champagne?"
"How does she do that?"
"Well, so to speak."
"Come work for me."
"When I say it."
"It's a commitment."
"You are Micky Ward."
"She is seven years old."
"They said no."
"No new messages."
"When do you want to leave?"
"Teach me to see."
"I arrived yesterday."
"I freed him."
"You have taste."
"I bought this."
"Would you like to try?"
"You should go to bed."
"We are the last."
"I want to believe you."
"I should be here."
"Down to the bone."
"He contacted me."
"Shall we play guessing games?"
"You can take it back."
"He is three years old."
"Can't you knock?"
"My life belongs to me."
"You will wait here."
"Don't call them."
"We can do anything."
"Tell me your secret."
"Phil, are you there?"
"You can speak well."
"She knows how to do it."
"Or nothing at all."
"I pulled over."
"This will be our stop."
"Where is the victim?"
"It was pitch black."
"It's a revolution."
"It's morphine."
"It's another one."
"Do you like magic?"
"Don't start, Mom."
"No, I'm going to walk."
"You have to control yourself."
"Can I go swimming?"
"No, but it will come."
"You think you know everything."
"I had done it."
"He admitted it."
"We should do it again."
"It always ends the same."
"That's the answer."
"What to say to people?"
"No fights here."
"She is very busy."
"Let me take it."
"I know, so what?"
"Thank you for this clarification."
"More than an hour."
"It's a club."
"I will pay you well."
"How is your health?"
"Someone rang."
"Grands-Pas will protect them."
"Does he work for you?"
"A little cognac?"
"It's so small."
"Bring me a beer."
"Does it suit me?"
"What did we say?"
"It changed me."
"But where am I?"
"Did you warn him?"
"She is still unconscious."
"I settle my accounts."
"It's a clone."
"Pass me the lamp."
"It's a mask."
"I had a family."
"Let me serve you."
"This guy is good."
"I have my job."
"Let's go talk downstairs."
"This is the end of the line."
"He was right."
"It was a decoy."
"Very close to here."
"Did you give it to him?"
"Yes, they are fine."
"I keep my distance."
"I want to be useful."
"It seems fine to me."
"Here is a pretty thing."
"He was very ill."
"Welcome to Las Vegas."
"No, you have to go."
"You will find me."
"The baby's father."
"It's a gun."
"Thanks for the car."
"Did I ring you?"
"A man without honor."
"They looked for him."
"But he is nice."
"It's so dark."
"Believe it or not."
"I trust them."
"Is the avatar unharmed?"
"Now I am married."
"What does he want to do?"
"Be proud of yourself."
"Did you talk to each other?"
"How does she feel?"
"How would she know?"
"My son is here."
"What kinds of things?"
"I want to wake up."
"It will be faster."
"How lucky I am."
"Here they come."
"Cell phones are prohibited."
"Behave like a man."
"He has my number."
"She looks like a girl."
"They are in cahoots."
"Yes, it is good."
"I want a room."
"I put them there."
"There are hundreds of them."
"Any news from him?"
"My home is here."
"It's a rabbit."
"You invited me."
"We will come and get you."
"I want a coffee."
"She's not joking."
"Just a little longer."
"Do I love him?"
"He engineered the whole thing."
"It's a tic."
"Have you had any?"
"Open his mouth."
"We had to do it."
"He did it again."
"You find me sublime."
"Any metal device."
"I want this one."
"He manipulated me."
"She recognized him."
"You will be happy."
"I love theater."
"It's a change."
"I will watch over them."
"You're going around in circles."
"Once a year."
"This is understandable."
"This is my price."
"I see the Shire."
"It's a tribute."
"He knows me well."
"Not for the money."
"Pass me the salt."
"It was a message."
"What are you doing then?"
"It will bring you luck."
"She is my wife."
"I confessed everything."
"You don't dance?"
"This can be remedied."
"Yes, it happened."
"I already know her."
"The King's Tree."
"I want to touch you."
"Nor the biggest ones."
"Busy being captured."
"You're going to see her."
"Have you been training?"
"Very good, actually."
"Thank you, it was great."
"He loved you very much."
"Your car is ready."
"What's on the menu?"
"Any messages for me?"
"They shouldn't."
"Very good, it works."
"I know, old man."
"You know that I do."
"Courage for our friends."
"Stay in the vehicle."
"I know my wife."
"Have a nice day, guys."
"Like the other day."
"I got the part."
"Did you bury him?"
"And his name is?"
"You're up early."
"What do you do with it?"
"In a little while."
"And the last time?"
"I'm going back tomorrow."
"They like you."
"It will relax you."
"This is their home."
"He makes us walk."
"But I tried."
"You have the power."
"Do you go there often?"
"That was the job."
"He comes to see me."
"It was the minimum."
"Yes, yes, go ahead."
"I love my mother."
"Can I talk now?"
"I'll buy it for you."
"They will find me."
"They are all different."
"It's cooler."
"Still in the hospital."
"Can we open it?"
"What is it, what?"
"Look in your pocket."
"Give me the picture."
"This is the system."
"A little bit more."
"How are you this morning?"
"Give me the wheel."
"The signal is clear."
"He is a mercenary."
"What kind of dreams?"
"After so many years?"
"He is very protective."
"My name is Tatiana."
"We tell the truth."
"I can imagine very well."
"Yeah, what is it?"
"I do it often."
"You are someone."
"Quick and painless."
"Do you hear voices?"
"Someone must know."
"He is now."
"It's okay, it's okay."
"Go take a bath."
"We have rules."
"I can find her again."
"They trust you."
"Sorry about your brother."
"Go home immediately."
"And he succeeded."
"Here she comes."
"They are humans."
"Do you want candy?"
"You're going to wake her up."
"No trace of them."
"He was so happy."
"He is really handsome."
"We'll resume later."
"Should I call someone?"
"I like your costume."
"Have you waited long?"
"He loves me very much."
"Are you going with me?"
"Go ahead, talk to him."
"None came."
"He has the money."
"Yes, you have it."
"Somewhere around here."
"She was a friend."
"I'm looking for a job."
"Listen to me very carefully."
"But I can try."
"Are you going to continue for long?"
"Who ordered this?"
"What would people say?"
"Is it leather?"
"Everyone smiles."
"You can get up."
"Where does the money go?"
"But everything changed."
"That's a good summary."
"Back to reality."
"Give me the lamp."
"Are you absolutely sure?"
"It's marked here."
"Thanks for noticing."
"Do you want some cheese?"
"This is our family."
"You will know what to do."
"Your wife is here."
"Here, keep the change."
"Yes, I would love that."
"It creates connections."
"Do you feel different?"
"It suits me perfectly."
"I am the same."
"I prefer to abstain."
"I supported you."
"Where is the ammunition?"
"Don't act like a girl."
"Let's give him a chance."
"See you on Friday."
"It's a coffin."
"You speak without knowing."
"Wake up, my darling."
"It's for now."
"Wait until you see her."
"Between you and me?"
"What does my Precious say?"
"I think it's wonderful."
"I woke him up."
"It's pretty clear."
"He is waving to us."
"When can you leave?"
"I'm going to change it."
"We invented it."
"My name is Rose."
"He is in conference."
"But you can't."
"I will have heard everything."
"When was that again?"
"Make less noise."
"What was he working on?"
"You are really kind."
"No one is sure."
"It was very romantic."
"Where are the cartridges?"
"She's the queen."
"The ventilation duct."
"Who was with him?"
"Are you really interested?"
"Good afternoon, sir."
"Nothing is real."
"I like ice cream."
"We all have to go."
"What is it now?"
"Do you want a spanking?"
"See an old friend."
"It doesn't exist anymore."
"Neither do the others."
"He wanted to protect me."
"It's going to be quick."
"Are you going to eat it?"
"Which one is cooking?"
"What to do with him?"
"That's a lot."
"It makes me hungry."
"Thank you for joining us."
"Where are the doctors?"
"That must be exciting."
"You will never win."
"End of alert."
"Yes, officer."
"I start early tomorrow."
"I have his legs."
"The captain is right."
"Give me the radio."
"Come on, it'll be okay."
"I already like it."
"Now it's different."
"We are so close."
"Yeah, he's right."
"The match is over."
"A mole."
"Is she yours?"
"This is the reserve."
"We save time."
"Welcome to Hong Kong."
"She is nine years old."
"It's a good deal."
"He was a good guy."
"It's my first day."
"This is my first time."
"It was the first time."
"Which side are you on?"
"We are on the same side."
"I don't care."
"Why did you come here?"
"I've been here before."
"I came for this."
"I came to get you."
"I'll come right away."
"A few minutes ago."
"I'm going to my room."
"It's a beautiful story."
"It's a beautiful house."
"He went that way."
"It's part of the job."
"It's for work."
"Have you seen anyone?"
"I'm willing to believe it."
"Where were you last night?"
"You're not ready."
"Who is that one?"
"No, it's not possible."
"You need to call the police."
"A week ago."
"I'm telling you the truth."
"But it's the truth."
"No, it's the truth."
"Can I trust you?"
"Can we trust him?"
"I don't trust."
"Business is business."
"I'm going to get my things."
"He was my best friend."
"But I beg you."
"What did you call me?"
"Did you call the police?"
"You are a good boy."
"He's a big boy."
"I'm a big boy."
"I'm a big girl."
"I know how it works."
"You know how it works."
"It might be important."
"You are safe now."
"You are safe here."
"It's part of the game."
"I remember him."
"I remember that."
"I have to go to class."
"I hardly know her."
"I will be in my office."
"This is my last word."
"Who does he think he is?"
"See you around."
"What is this plan?"
"So what's the plan?"
"We always have a choice."
"I am happy for you."
"Easy for you to say."
"It's always a pleasure."
"What a pleasure to see you."
"That's nice to hear."
"She won't."
"Do you want to take a ride?"
"Can we change the subject?"
"I think it will be fine."
"I'll do anything."
"Too early to tell."
"I'll be back in a moment."
"I'll be back in an hour."
"That's it, that's enough."
"You don't love me anymore?"
"That's my opinion too."
"I'll be back in a second."
"A market is a market."
"We made a deal."
"That's kind of you."
"He's a nice boy."
"Thank you, that's very kind."
"Have you been there yet?"
"There is a way."
"It hasn't changed."
"Two weeks ago."
"A few weeks ago."
"Where did you learn that?"
"Take me in your arms."
"Isn't that right, darling?"
"Maybe next time."
"Mom, please."
"Come on, please."
"Come, please."
"Dad, please."
"Please, no."
"Wait, please."
"Sir, please."
"Please, Mom."
"I would do anything."
"I'd better get back."
"I'll get something to drink."
"It's not worth it."
"Can I take a message?"
"A year ago."
"We take care of everything."
"Yes, I'll take care of it."
"I'm often told that."
"I have to take this call."
"Everyone is happy."
"Glad you're here."
"Can you keep a secret?"
"It will be our little secret."
"She didn't come."
"She came to see me."
"Let's see how it goes."
"Let's see what we have."
"It's thanks to you."
"He had an accident."
"She had an accident."
"Did you have an accident."
"Does this remind you of anything?"
"That reminds me of something."
"I'm leaving right away."
"You are free to go."
"A bullet in the head."
"Can I leave the table?"
"I had to do something."
"Isn't she gorgeous?"
"A little further to the left."
"It came out on its own."
"What's up, guys?"
"How are you doing, buddy?"
"What's up, buddy?"
"This is a true story."
"Did she tell you?"
"He is inside."
"I've said it before."
"Because I love him."
"Have you seen the time?"
"It looks serious."
"He always has been."
"It always has been."
"She is in the hospital."
"Where did you get it?"
"But I did it."
"But you did it."
"Who isn't?"
"No one saw him."
"Either one."
"She seems nice."
"Someone did it."
"He looks nice."
"He seems nice."
"He already did it."
"He looks good."
"Who gave it to you?"
"I'm in the hospital."
"It's gold."
"How did you get it?"
"Have you seen it yet?"
"I just bought it."
"Yes, I saw her."
"She's inside."
"It is for me."
"And he did."
"When did you see him?"
"She looks good."
"Can I ask a question?"
"I was shot."
"I shot him."
"He shot me."
"We've known each other for a long time."
"It's me who offers."
"That's good advice."
"It's in the box."
"I don't judge you."
"I'm going to go to bed."
"You have no proof."
"I'll open the door."
"Do you want some company?"
"This time it's different."
"Nobody is going anywhere."
"Take good care of yourself."
"I'm in love with you."
"You can remain silent."
"You might be right."
"I have always loved you."
"I wanted to talk to you about it."
"Did he tell you that?"
"What will he do?"
"Did she tell you that?"
"I told you about it."
"Go ahead, I'm listening."
"I love you too, Dad."
"You should go away."
"Who gave you this?"
"How did he do it?"
"You got had."
"Can you take care of it?"
"I love you, my darling."
"I'm in great shape."
"We'll keep you posted."
"Life is a gift."
"Do you know how to use it?"
"Thank you for saving me."
"Everything is going as planned."
"There are rules."
"It's a full moon."
"I'm going to make some tea."
"We'll see you later."
"He is a human being."
"I am a human being."
"Call it what you will."
"It's going to be a long night."
"The night was long."
"Can I go to the bathroom?"
"Can I use your restroom?"
"As long as it takes."
"Do you need money?"
"Have you changed your mind?"
"Do you remember her?"
"No more than usual."
"Thank you very much for coming."
"Don't you agree?"
"I want to get out of here."
"I want to leave here."
"No time to explain."
"I remember her."
"This might take a long time."
"We need her."
"I take care of them."
"Do you have any others?"
"Would you excuse me?"
"What's the hurry?"
"No, not that I know of."
"I give you my word."
"I take your word for it."
"You're imagining things."
"I'll have to call you back."
"In the bathroom."
"I want you to stay."
"It won't be necessary."
"Everyone loved him."
"It's quite the opposite."
"This is not funny."
"I brought this for you."
"Find someone else."
"I realize it."
"Do you realize that?"
"I'm the one paying."
"It's art."
"Can I be of help to you?"
"I was in the area."
"I need him."
"I should have thought of that."
"I have a lot of work."
"I have a lot to do."
"I heard a noise."
"I have another call."
"I saw something."
"I know something about it."
"I was going to tell you."
"I have little time."
"I called the police."
"I have another one."
"I've never seen that."
"I should have listened to you."
"I should have been there."
"I have others."
"I had an accident."
"I need this."
"I need to think."
"I told the truth."
"I forgot something."
"I already have one."
"How much time do I have?"
"I thought of you."
"I read your file."
"I have my little idea."
"What do I think about it?"
"I forgot his name."
"I need her."
"I have better things to do."
"Did I do something?"
"Do I look like it?"
"I've seen enough."
"I needed money."
"I had an idea."
"I have a great idea."
"I did my part."
"I'll be there in a moment."
"I found one."
"I just have one question."
"I did my job."
"I was going to tell you about it."
"I gave my word."
"Look what I have."
"I left a message."
"I'll be there in a second."
"I met a girl."
"I have that impression."
"I have some great news."
"I am very lucky."
"I intend to."
"I was in the neighborhood."
"I made coffee."
"I need it now."
"I did my duty."
"She's a nice girl."
"Let's not talk about that."
"It's in the bag."
"No one will know anything about it."
"I wish you good luck."
"I feel the same way."
"He's an old friend."
"The doorbell rings."
"It's human nature."
"I looked for it everywhere."
"You need rest."
"I need rest."
"If I may."
"I've thought about it a lot."
"Isn't it obvious?"
"I'm going shopping."
"I take responsibility for it."
"I need answers."
"You read my mind."
"I have turned the page."
"I had a vision."
"Step back, please."
"It was a setup."
"I should have kept quiet."
"I'm a big fan."
"I made a promise."
"This is a great idea."
"I've always dreamed of it."
"It's a pretty name."
"How did you meet?"
"Have we met before?"
"You'd better go."
"When we talk about the wolf."
"I'll offer you a deal."
"Can I get you something?"
"Can I get you a drink?"
"This is excellent news."
"You won't."
"Allow me to introduce myself."
"Where did they all go?"
"Please follow me."
"I'll talk to you later."
"Who would do such a thing?"
"You did it on purpose."
"Prevention is better than cure."
"You will never find us."
"He's a nice guy."
"I'll give you a hint."
"I can take care of that."
"I'm grateful to you."
"I'm very much obliged to you."
"I feel like throwing up."
"I want you to come."
"What was it about?"
"You're hiding something from me."
"You are hiding something from me."
"Mind your own business."
"You're worth more than that."
"Let's get this straight."
"It's all done."
"I'm sick of it."
"I've crossed the line."
"I had a great time."
"Not that I remember."
"Take a leaf out of his book."
"We had a lot of fun."
"I want you to come back."
"You're doing very well."
"I expressed myself badly."
"Do you want me to drive?"
"What are you getting involved in?"
"I'm the one treating."
"You'll thank me later."
"Thank you for walking me home."
"It's that or nothing."
"That was the last time."
"I feel great."
"You have to come with me."
"You must come with me."
"You can be sure of it."
"This is the best solution."
"I'm the one inviting."
"He went home."
"I only have this."
"Tell me where she is."
"That looks cool."
"I was just thinking about you."
"You didn't understand."
"She always has been."
"Gentlemen, please."
"Gentlemen, I beg you."
"I have experience."
"Can we talk in private?"
"I'll take care of everything."
"I didn't know her."
"I haven't seen her."
"Can I count on you?"
"I have to get back to the office."
"It was a different time."
"I know who he is."
"I need to talk."
"Is this a good idea?"
"Why are you still here?"
"I let him go."
"Is it far from here?"
"Can I have a cigarette?"
"The witness may withdraw."
"They need us."
"It's in the Bible."
"Do you want to play this?"
"I'm doing this for you."
"You didn't hear anything?"
"Lives are at stake."
"No, it's mine."
"No, that won't happen."
"I knew you would understand."
"It suits me very well."
"What was that thing?"
"Where are you going with this?"
"What's that look?"
"I am at your service."
"I heard voices."
"Good night, everyone."
"Can I make a suggestion?"
"That's something, huh?"
"We should call the police."
"Can I have a coffee?"
"This is great news."
"I tell you no."
"No, I guess not."
"It all happened so fast."
"You will need this."
"Actually, you know what?"
"She was my best friend."
"We've all done it."
"Give me another chance."
"Do you have any change?"
"Thank you for inviting us."
"There are so many."
"I can't go."
"I'll never make it."
"He came to see me."
"I'm going to have a coffee."
"I love you too, Mom."
"Can I have a beer?"
"You're a good boy."
"I made my choice."
"You are in the hospital."
"Where does the money come from?"
"What do you expect from us?"
"You should be in bed."
"Sorry for being late."
"Thank you for helping me."
"I'll arrive as soon as possible."
"I didn't notice anything."
"I need water."
"Two, please."
"Do you know where we are?"
"I saw his face."
"It's almost time."
"I forgot my bag."
"I will always be with you."
"The story of my life."
"It was just a question."
"I forgot my wallet."
"Do you know where you're going?"
"We're going to the hospital."
"How long will you be here?"
"Who gave the order?"
"You just said it."
"We are on schedule."
"Is this your first time?"
"You should have seen this."
"They found nothing."
"Everyone knew it."
"I owe you that."
"Put yourself in my shoes."
"What is this in honor of?"
"Let's face it."
"I'll be back as soon as possible."
"No, it's something else."
"I'm trying to concentrate."
"I'm doing it for you."
"Who turned off the light?"
"I want to come with you."
"He's doing his best."
"I'm going to have a drink."
"It was my mother's."
"Dinner is almost ready."
"I told him everything."
"I love you, you know."
"You'll pay for this."
"I can see it from here."
"It's a beautiful place."
"She's a big girl."
"I'll turn the question back on you."
"Why did you say that?"
"I'll see you tonight."
"I saw him do it."
"You look nice."
"Who is the lucky one?"
"How long are you staying?"
"Or maybe it is."
"Who's there?"
"This is not professional."
"Someone I know?"
"That explains a lot."
"Can I have your autograph?"
"I'm telling you now."
"Can I use your phone?"
"I looked for her everywhere."
"A few years ago."
"This is the third time."
"Do we know who it is?"
"That's good to hear."
"We are the police."
"Have you been here long?"
"This is my livelihood."
"He told me everything."
"I know you know."
"Six months ago."
"I know where they are."
"Can't read?"
"It turns out that it is."
"I love you, my son."
"Rules are rules."
"I know everything about you."
"This is what I propose."
"I'm right behind you."
"They are not ready."
"I saw someone."
"Listen, I have to go."
"I'm going to need it."
"You are making the right choice."
"This is the good news."
"I ask you a question."
"What do you think of him?"
"I need to call."
"Who does she think she is?"
"I need a vacation."
"I just wanted to see you."
"He's not interested."
"A boy and a girl."
"Everyone loves him."
"She is in her room."
"It's you and me."
"So don't do it."
"This is what I do."
"I want to see my son."
"Nobody said that."
"Everyone knows him."
"I came for you."
"I needed you."
"It's just a question."
"I'm going to walk a little."
"Does it work?"
"Up to a point."
"It's no secret."
"It's fair game."
"How did you find us?"
"He is in his room."
"Do you want to watch TV?"
"I thought you knew."
"I'm in love with her."
"Have you been there before?"
"I am with someone."
"I've been there before."
"Everyone does that."
"Is this for real?"
"Thank you for bringing me back."
"But that's in the past."
"May she rest in peace."
"I didn't order anything."
"Five years ago."
"Do you want another one?"
"That's what love is."
"Who taught you that?"
"The end justifies the means."
"He needs rest."
"I read the report."
"There are still some."
"What did you say there?"
"It's going to take a while."
"We have a lot of work."
"It came out like that."
"Who are you telling?"
"Fingers in the nose."
"It's against the rules."
"This is beautiful work."
"Yes, he did."
"Yes, you did."
"Please, Dad."
"I took a taxi."
"I have to get up early."
"It's about you."
"You're a good guy."
"I heard it said."
"Do you want to play with me?"
"Basically, that's it."
"I go to school."
"You see I am delighted."
"I'll get rid of it."
"Some more than others."
"I know you can."
"It's for children."
"He changed his mind."
"You remind me of someone."
"That's good, my boy."
"Have you met someone?"
"Yes, that's very good."
"I will never do that."
"You're coming home."
"You were shot."
"You are wanted on the phone."
"How did he do that?"
"I'm waiting in the car."
"I need a name."
"I remember it well."
"He's just a friend."
"Have you seen this man?"
"That's an excellent question."
"We move on to plan B."
"This is for your safety."
"I have faith in you."
"There always are."
"It's like a dream."
"He needs us."
"I was waiting for the right moment."
"I'm willing to believe you."
"Give me some water."
"I followed your advice."
"I'll take your word for it."
"Did you see anything?"
"Open, please."
"I thought you were asleep."
"This is the right decision."
"Do you want to dance with me?"
"I'll get my bag."
"Have you seen his face?"
"Did you see his face?"
"We have a lot to do."
"Great minds think alike."
"I'm going to do it."
"Don't you like it?"
"How are you holding up?"
"I only do that."
"I already told him."
"What was all that about?"
"Are you feeling up to it?"
"Did you hear something?"
"I don't do that anymore."
"They did nothing."
"I will go all the way."
"How do you know about this?"
"I know how to keep a secret."
"I think that's enough."
"This is the perfect time."
"Everything looks normal."
"This is a great moment."
"You don't trust?"
"You are a good man."
"How did it get there?"
"It's a new beginning."
"Can I sit here?"
"Everyone says that."
"I can tell you."
"We were just talking about you."
"Do you want to see something?"
"We are proud of you."
"It's dynamite."
"I really need it."
"I should have called you."
"We're inside."
"Walls have ears."
"It's a beautiful name."
"Do you want to come to my house?"
"You are a good friend."
"And all this for what?"
"I hope you understand."
"I should have seen it."
"I read the file."
"Everyone goes there."
"He's one of us."
"That's just my luck."
"She told me everything."
"It's a little early."
"You won't do anything with it."
"He's around here."
"Are you going to tell me?"
"That's it, go ahead."
"I feel better now."
"I'll get some coffee."
"You must come with us."
"Like everyone else, right?"
"I have to see someone."
"I did my homework."
"Can I see your papers?"
"I will read the votes."
"They look happy."
"Do you have a long time?"
"Where did you meet him?"
"I want all the details."
"Did you forget something?"
"I don't know, Mom."
"Yes, I said it."
"I need space."
"Everything is fine, my dear."
"Maybe it's her."
"He is in the car."
"I ask you to leave."
"Doesn't that remind you of anything?"
"Has this ever happened to you?"
"We made love."
"He was a great man."
"Did he talk about me?"
"But for how long?"
"We make a good team."
"You can say that."
"It was a good day."
"But I know one thing."
"It's a private party."
"Are you really going to do it?"
"It never is."
"That's not an answer."
"I recognize you there."
"Yes, that's him."
"I've seen you before."
"What's that name?"
"Can I take your order?"
"But enough about me."
"It was the only way."
"It's a good choice."
"Yes, that must be it."
"We're taking care of him."
"No, I can do it."
"That's the only reason."
"It's every man for himself."
"This is a big step."
"But I will do it."
"It's in my nature."
"I didn't answer."
"Say you love me."
"Yes, that's me."
"Please excuse me for a moment."
"I have another question."
"We move on."
"You could say that, yes."
"This is for my mother."
"I think it works."
"I can manage on my own."
"You could have called me."
"It would do you good."
"Where could he be?"
"He did not survive."
"Just do it."
"What do you remember?"
"He is in the kitchen."
"It's not going well at all."
"And you did it."
"Go ahead, I'll join you."
"It suits you very well."
"It was last week."
"Are you dating someone?"
"I'm going to go see her."
"This is for my father."
"You are in a good mood."
"Isn't it beautiful?"
"The love of my life."
"It happens every day."
"I'm the boss."
"Have you ever thought about it?"
"Someone wants to see you."
"That's all over."
"I received a call."
"Goodbye and good luck."
"If only it were true."
"Do you know where we're going?"
"It happened once."
"Do you have any other questions?"
"I'll tell you later."
"This is the only way out."
"They may be right."
"I forgot my keys."
"There is one thing."
"You won't do that."
"What's all this commotion?"
"Tell me who it is."
"Yes, you said it."
"I'm going to have a beer."
"What is it this time?"
"But yes, that's it."
"Calling all units."
"It makes me feel good."
"This is often the case."
"But you already knew that."
"We have to go now."
"I'll be in the car."
"I'm not there."
"How did I get here?"
"This is the best time."
"You need to eat something."
"She is a good woman."
"As if it were yesterday."
"Don't trust him."
"Of course we can."
"You don't think about it."
"This is where we are."
"So long ago."
"That's a bit strong."
"No, it's too early."
"I would have guessed."
"What a pleasure to see you again."
"Glad you came."
"It changed my life."
"She changed her mind."
"They are no longer there."
"And I found this."
"Very nice to meet you."
"Just what you need."
"She already did it."
"I thought of everything."
"I can explain everything to you."
"Do you know where they are?"
"Did we understand each other?"
"Do you want to know the truth?"
"I didn't see."
"I asked a question."
"I've already thought about it."
"Is it true or not?"
"But things have changed."
"Isn't that enough?"
"Where did you find them?"
"I've always said it."
"You are doing a good job."
"It's a simple question."
"Did he say anything else?"
"I slept with him."
"It's within my capabilities."
"Breakfast is ready."
"Can anyone confirm this?"
"You look like it."
"Thank you for calling me."
"I was told about it."
"She's just a friend."
"I'm just looking around."
"She needs us."
"Can I go home?"
"He had a stroke."
"Yes, I have one."
"Can I have your attention?"
"Your wish is my command."
"It got me thinking."
"Papers, please."
"What year is it?"
"I have everything under control."
"Is it yes or no?"
"Do you want to make love?"
"My name is Oliver Queen."
"Are we in agreement?"
"I saw it too."
"It was in the newspapers."
"There is a chance."
"I know where to find him."
"How much will it cost me?"
"Would you like to leave a message?"
"You have the green light."
"I retired."
"This is an interesting theory."
"How did you get here?"
"It's my father's."
"Don't go too far."
"You haven't forgotten anything?"
"Have you forgotten anything?"
"What did he answer?"
"I have other plans."
"I'll get a towel."
"I saw the pictures."
"I still have work to do."
"It's my mother's."
"She needs rest."
"Is that your last word?"
"I need one."
"How did you get this?"
"You should come with us."
"Look who's back."
"She is everything to me."
"Will you be here for a long time?"
"It's all in the wrist."
"Who told you about it?"
"Doesn't that bother you?"
"I completely agree."
"I'm good at it."
"There was someone."
"Yes, I saw that."
"I slept with her."
"That's a good sign, right?"
"I'm family."
"No, not so much."
"It may take time."
"It's a good day."
"Do what you can."
"And how do you know that?"
"There is a solution."
"Don't just stand there."
"I'm going to the airport."
"Yes, there are."
"I have nothing else."
"I've thought about it carefully."
"Do you feel capable of it?"
"What is this about?"
"I have a good idea."
"That is very true."
"What I said."
"This is a big deal."
"I'll join you later."
"It's a delicate situation."
"That would make me very happy."
"Nobody saw me."
"I'm going to call the cops."
"Because I know it."
"At least, I hope so."
"I have a good one."
"That's a good reason."
"Can I?"
"I'll get my things."
"Since when have you known?"
"It's an old story."
"I owe you my life."
"You'll need this."
"She doesn't know anything about it."
"She wouldn't do that."
"Where did you put it?"
"I wanted to give this to you."
"I have a good feeling."
"I am a married man."
"No, not yet."
"I was going to ask you that."
"There is an explanation."
"I am all yours."
"I would like to say something."
"How could I forget?"
"And I can prove it."
"There is a woman."
"I've done my time."
"I saw the movie."
"I am not him."
"Can I buy you a coffee?"
"I work for the government."
"He made his choice."
"Nice to see you too."
"We are here for you."
"I don't recognize him."
"How did they find us?"
"Well, that's true."
"Three months ago."
"It's good for us."
"This is our only lead."
"One day or another."
"No, no, I'm fine."
"We start from the beginning."
"It was the only solution."
"You're doing a good job."
"And that's the truth."
"If you agree."
"This is our best chance."
"Can you do something?"
"No, you shouldn't."
"People don't change."
"How will it go?"
"I just have a few questions."
"A little further to the right."
"I told you no."
"Excuse me for a second?"
"For what it's worth."
"Is this your mother again?"
"I gave you everything."
"He was a good boy."
"Some things never change."
"I have to go to the office."
"I want to see my lawyer."
"Where does this come from?"
"I kept my promise."
"It's on my way."
"But that's life."
"I just saw her."
"Yes, I can do it."
"I saw the news."
"Maybe I will."
"I want to see my father."
"See you at the office."
"May I ask you why?"
"No, I don't want any."
"I'll do it later."
"I received your message."
"Who is behind all this?"
"I'm very happy here."
"I let you down."
"Who found the body?"
"Welcome to my humble abode."
"You look happy."
"She's all yours."
"I saw him yesterday."
"You are the expert."
"What can you tell us?"
"I made a list."
"I don't know, Dad."
"I'll go now."
"Because I want to."
"A lot has changed."
"No, that won't work."
"Are you with someone?"
"I'm ready to go."
"Is that your real name?"
"I am in good health."
"That's life."
"There is some of that."
"Not for everyone."
"Do you feel better now?"
"It was my father's."
"It will never happen again."
"So that's how it is?"
"I'll buy you a drink."
"Because I say so."
"I just got it."
"They are human beings."
"There was a girl."
"It was more than that."
"I made a choice."
"Like most people."
"I always have."
"We'll talk to you later."
"I just wanted to thank you."
"Everyone thinks so."
"You two, come with me."
"A promise is a promise."
"I'll fix that for you."
"This is my grandmother."
"This is the pure truth."
"To what do I owe the honor?"
"Oh, yes, that's true."
"The law is the law."
"I hope you like it."
"I'll be back in five minutes."
"He told the truth."
"I'm inviting you to dinner."
"No, he can't."
"Put yourself in his shoes."
"You will be safe there."
"I'll get you some."
"Come forward, please."
"Yes, I will do it."
"We are home."
"I had a revelation."
"I am here for you."
"How can we do this?"
"Have you done your homework?"
"Yes, that's exactly it."
"I have one too."
"You are a big boy."
"Whatever the cost."
"Maybe we'll see each other again."
"Did she tell you about it?"
"Have you thought about that?"
"Give me one good reason."
"See you at dinner."
"You can't come."
"I learned my lesson."
"I have known him for a long time."
"You'll never make it."
"It's for the house."
"How is everyone doing?"
"Three weeks ago."
"I forgot my glasses."
"I was thinking of something else."
"I would like you to come."
"You have to tell me."
"Because I know you."
"Can I take a picture?"
"I wanted to be with you."
"Everyone loves you."
"She hasn't changed."
"You are like your father."
"In the middle of nowhere."
"Now it's too late."
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
"This is my little girl."
"And me, in all this?"
"Maybe it's me."
"Only we remain."
"It's the weekend."
"Where did they take him?"
"I just wanted to apologize."
"So how are you feeling?"
"A matter of perspective."
"Nothing makes sense."
"Someone wants to talk to you."
"He knows who I am."
"A man and a woman."
"How long have you known?"
"I bought this for you."
"I'm on to something."
"So who did it?"
"I went home."
"It's a lot of work."
"I am well aware of that."
"It was him or me."
"Look who I found."
"I saw things."
"Stay, please."
"I tell you yes."
"Good luck tonight."
"I'm waiting for the right moment."
"I was in the hospital."
"To what do I owe this pleasure?"
"I love you, sweetie."
"I need to work."
"But how is this possible?"
"I'm starting to get hungry."
"He is a great man."
"Did she talk about me?"
"This is my grandfather."
"I did you a favor."
"No, no, everything is fine."
"Everyone is."
"Are you going to school?"
"Am I dreaming?"
"I feel so much better."
"Go get some water."
"I didn't plan for that."
"That's all for me."
"I'll call you a taxi."
"It's a small world, isn't it?"
"I have visitors."
"Orders are orders."
"Would you listen to me?"
"This is real life."
"Do you want to do something?"
"Forever and ever."
"We'll take care of the rest."
"Are you here for that?"
"Do something for me."
"What good wind brings you?"
"I'm looking forward to it."
"Who said otherwise?"
"You are on air."
"Wait, I have an idea."
"You are at home here."
"He never came."
"Don't say a word."
"Anyone want anything?"
"Who else is there?"
"Let me come with you."
"I was born like this."
"How many are we at?"
"We all have secrets."
"It's as easy as pie."
"I needed air."
"He is in his office."
"How long has he been here?"
"I let her go."
"If it makes you happy."
"We've all seen it."
"It's really something."
"Do you know how much it costs?"
"Do you have water?"
"I like this place."
"I just wanted to talk to him."
"I am an old man."
"All you need."
"Anywhere but here."
"Yes, that's how it is."
"Can I take a shower?"
"I thought I was clear."
"Never seen in my life."
"You do as you wish."
"You look surprised."
"I'll have to go."
"A little help?"
"Your face is familiar to me."
"We took care of it."
"Who wouldn't be?"
"You're family."
"Who asked you?"
"Do you know where he lives?"
"Something is going on."
"He taught me everything."
"I still don't know."
"Nice to have met you."
"Ten years ago."
"To what do I owe this honor?"
"I barely knew her."
"They are inside."
"You have a lot to learn."
"It's against the law."
"He's a good cop."
"Tell me who you are."
"Why are you making that face?"
"I can live with that."
"No, I don't find it."
"You are blacklisted."
"It's another world."
"This is standard procedure."
"You should go see him."
"I taught him everything."
"One after the other."
"Glad to be back."
"Have a great weekend."
"What are you talking about, man?"
"I saw one."
"Can you hold this for me?"
"You've crossed the line."
"I love you even more."
"What's the idea?"
"They didn't say anything."
"It's a long journey."
"Madam, please."
"For me, it's the same."
"We are safe here."
"What's your story?"
"This is a historic moment."
"What do I owe the pleasure?"
"We must find a solution."
"A boy or a girl?"
"Hopefully."
"Will you buy me a drink?"
"Can I have a drink?"
"The investigation is ongoing."
"But you don't understand."
"I see you there."
"You never listen to me."
"What's that for?"
"This is awesome."
"Who doesn't have one?"
"It's just an expression."
"He is in love with you."
"No, I didn't say anything."
"The journey was long."
"I'm inside."
"She'll get over it."
"We have the green light."
"Would you please calm down?"
"That's already something."
"You have to let me go."
"Do you have to go somewhere?"
"I don't love him anymore."
"A while ago."
"Do as you feel."
"I told him about it."
"This is not fun."
"Actually, not at all."
"That's him over there."
"I'll get it for you."
"Call me whenever you want."
"Something like that, yes."
"You are my only friend."
"I dropped it."
"Don't you understand that?"
"Are you really going to do that?"
"This is against the rules."
"This is insanity."
"How is it different?"
"It's right next door."
"I want money."
"I just made it up."
"I heard the news."
"This is a unique opportunity."
"This is my grandson."
"You are my only family."
"He's a good kid."
"Thank you for coming with me."
"I'm just making conversation."
"You're a good dog."
"I thought about that too."
"Why are you interested in this?"
"You still don't understand?"
"I don't want to play."
"I have a clear conscience."
"They shot him."
"I need information."
"This has to stay between us."
"She asked me."
"She doesn't speak English."
"You always have."
"I needed this."
"He looks happy."
"She's a little girl."
"Everyone will be there."
"I'm on a case."
"I got the message."
"This is an important decision."
"But I saw it."
"I'll show it to you."
"That's good, my daughter."
"I did the math."
"I did what was necessary."
"What is it, exactly?"
"We'll discuss it later."
"What should I call you?"
"Take good care of her."
"I'd like a drink."
"I'd love a drink."
"You have made your choice."
"I'll be back in a few minutes."
"I want her back."
"Thank you for everything."
"You are like the others."
"You are like everyone else."
"I don't even know."
"They don't have any."
"We just did it."
"He is in great shape."
"I need reinforcements."
"It's time to act."
"What is your favorite color?"
"It's a big city."
"Don't tell him that."
"What's that face?"
"But I have to do it."
"I gave it a try."
"It's in your best interest."
"But he did."
"What he did."
"You're welcome, madam."
"Did I really say that?"
"How do we get out of here?"
"He is a little boy."
"You are in charge."
"I could have done it."
"We just arrived."
"Do you see who it is?"
"He decides."
"Do you want to please me?"
"Unity is strength."
"I've known him forever."
"I know, you're right."
"What was that for?"
"Five minutes ago."
"Yes, yes, that's it."
"I must have passed out."
"There are several."
"May God rest his soul."
"Have you heard from him?"
"No one saw her."
"I love you anyway."
"I feel so good."
"You just have to ask."
"That means something."
"I need to check something."
"It's easy for you."
"He is a good dog."
"I can assure you of that."
"They are not human."
"She didn't answer."
"Where did you meet?"
"Why do you always do this?"
"I'll get the keys."
"Okay, I have to go."
"You ask too many questions."
"Leave it, I'll take care of it."
"You took everything from me."
"I took the bus."
"When did you talk to him?"
"To your battle stations."
"How are you tonight?"
"Shall I drop you off somewhere?"
"Where did you hide it?"
"There is a connection."
"I'll see you tomorrow morning."
"It's important to him."
"It's a lucky charm."
"I have to go too."
"What have I done?"
"Please come out."
"He's there, somewhere."
"That's very kind, thank you."
"It's poetry."
"Not a second longer."
"I made sure of it."
"Drink some water."
"Because you love me."
"I just met him."
"You'll get over it."
"Give me money."
"It's Valentine's Day."
"But it's a start."
"It happened this morning."
"He was a good cop."
"Are you in love with her?"
"We need this."
"Yes, I can do that."
"Sorry to call so late."
"What do you expect?"
"Here's what I think."
"It has to come out."
"Do you want to know a secret?"
"I got over it."
"And how do we do that?"
"We've just started."
"I read your book."
"I'm going to close the door."
"Who is in charge here?"
"Excuse me, please."
"He must be somewhere."
"I went to see him."
"Permission to board?"
"There were some everywhere."
"It's him or me."
"You should go talk to him."
"How did he get there?"
"It reminds me of someone."
"What's his story?"
"She shot me."
"Do you understand anything about it?"
"It's time for a change."
"A man or a woman?"
"It's time to vote."
"I offer you my condolences."
"I wonder that too."
"I know, I was there."
"Where did the others go?"
"No, on the other side."
"I'm still the same."
"What else do you know?"
"We're going to the beach."
"This better work."
"And I'm proud of it."
"I told him no."
"What do you think I am?"
"What's it called again?"
"I always loved her."
"Someone came here."
"This is a great job."
"What is this music?"
"He's loaded."
"You got up early."
"You've thought of everything."
"It was in the newspaper."
"She is a pretty girl."
"All right, you know what?"
"Do you want to have a drink?"
"All I have."
"Is that the plan?"
"It's a beautiful night."
"Do you have another idea?"
"Oh, I almost forgot."
"I'm feeling a little peckish."
"Have you talked to him about it?"
"I saw the video."
"For me, anyway."
"How did he take it?"
"I want this to work."
"Everyone loves Raymond."
"Do you remember us?"
"It's just an impression."
"You should have seen that."
"What did you do next?"
"Do you want me to continue?"
"Are we really going to do this?"
"I have to go see him."
"But it's worth it."
"I want to live with you."
"I always thought so."
"This is a good place."
"It makes me very happy."
"It's upside down."
"I want to see my wife."
"She was everything to me."
"I want to know the truth."
"This is how we're going to do it."
"Did he tell you about it?"
"We did it together."
"You're just in time."
"You did your duty."
"I can take you there."
"I'm going to take a picture."
"He must be around there."
"Do you do weight training?"
"It's going to be a piece of cake."
"It's in the newspapers."
"What is the occasion?"
"Thanks for letting me know."
"I just met her."
"I want him to leave."
"It's just a precaution."
"Can you close the door?"
"Have you seen a doctor?"
"You have to get out of here."
"I won't be."
"What are you doing to me now?"
"And I will always love you."
"The customer is always right."
"Four years ago."
"What have I done to you?"
"And I thank you for that."
"Do you have any aspirin?"
"Who did this to him?"
"Are you ready to go?"
"But we don't care."
"And I will do it."
"Let it stay between us."
"I volunteered."
"There is a cure."
"This is a beautiful photo."
"No, I'm not hungry."
"That's for me."
"She won't know anything about it."
"It's time to grow up."
"Do you live nearby?"
"I let him do it."
"How can you know that?"
"I have to go to town."
"I need a doctor."
"I'm pretty sure of it."
"Want to take a ride?"
"You know, you're right."
"That's my real name."
"I understood very well."
"Your price will be mine."
"There was a man."
"And what am I?"
"I know where we are."
"I need to make a call."
"Did you have an accident?"
"It took time."
"It's science."
"I'll take you at your word."
"But it's over now."
"Do you want another beer?"
"I'm in the phone book."
"I'll send you the address."
"You should see a doctor."
"I have a little girl."
"It's a bit tight."
"I gave him everything."
"At your place or mine?"
"This is my stepfather."
"It's like riding a bike."
"Are you ready for this?"
"I really love you very much."
"Where are everyone else?"
"She didn't leave."
"There is coffee."
"Who do you think we are?"
"I'm past the age."
"Where did that come from?"
"She went that way."
"Who let you in?"
"Hey, what's this?"
"He's right, you know."
"There must be some."
"No, I couldn't."
"She didn't see anything."
"It was not intended."
"It's quite a story."
"How did he get here?"
"I know I can."
"We must go."
"Where is he hiding?"
"Do you want to get out of here?"
"Smoking is prohibited."
"How many children do you have?"
"I have to go there."
"I know where you're going."
"We're going to have a lot of fun."
"What is happening to us?"
"Okay, I'll do it."
"I want to see my brother."
"When did you see her?"
"Have you read the newspapers?"
"Are we really going to do it?"
"You are a nice boy."
"All that is over."
"He told us."
"I have lots of ideas."
"I think the same thing."
"Don't go any further."
"And you, what's new?"
"No need to do that."
"Maybe we should leave."
"Say what you think."
"They left that way."
"But it was worth it."
"Show some respect."
"There was one."
"Did you take your medication?"
"Yes, that's the truth."
"How did you find out?"
"How did it end?"
"Don't talk about it."
"I will be there for you."
"I heard screams."
"How dare you say that?"
"I get chills."
"Exactly what I thought."
"I want to know more."
"I'm talking nonsense."
"Like everyone else here."
"I will take care of him."
"Did you do all that?"
"She was a good girl."
"It's part of the process."
"This is my last offer."
"It comes from above."
"She's an old friend."
"I am a good mother."
"We can find a solution."
"Can I stay with you?"
"I promised you."
"I'm done talking."
"Do you all agree?"
"I saw her yesterday."
"Does that answer your question?"
"Do you want another drink?"
"It will do me good."
"I'll go upstairs and look."
"I have a little idea."
"You should come with me."
"You should have seen it."
"I can afford it."
"I'll get you out."
"I need advice."
"Who is this girl?"
"Did he really say that?"
"I've been doing this for a long time."
"I'm going inside."
"This is the second time."
"Yeah, I remember that."
"How are things going there?"
"The decision has been made."
"I know everyone."
"I don't mind."
"He is capable of anything."
"Have you notified the police?"
"I was just passing by."
"Attention, please."
"Of course it's okay."
"They are making fun of us."
"I know a lot of things."
"I would have liked to see that."
"Prepare for impact."
"Feels good, huh?"
"It's for a friend."
"But we can't."
"Someone had to do it."
"It's a safe place."
"What do you think of her?"
"It's a real miracle."
"Who are these?"
"I have it in visual."
"You're coming with me."
"Want to know more?"
"I will never forgive him."
"But I have a question."
"I've already spoken to him."
"It's next week."
"Are there any survivors?"
"You are a good father."
"It's always been you."
"My watch stopped."
"Anyone have a pen?"
"Do I look good?"
"I'll be back in a few hours."
"She must be somewhere."
"She made her choice."
"You will hear from me."
"You look like your mother."
"I'll get the doctor."
"So where were we?"
"So, where were we?"
"Have you seen this guy?"
"I'm in the kitchen."
"What a joy to see you again."
"Nobody said anything."
"I came back for you."
"I tried to call."
"I just got married."
"Have you known each other for a long time?"
"She went home."
"You took your time."
"She's in the car."
"What do you know about her?"
"I feel good here."
"He's making fun of us."
"It's in the air."
"I'm at the hotel."
"You can trust him."
"I will be in my room."
"I have to go to court."
"I was there first."
"I'm doing this for us."
"You can go now."
"I put the speaker on."
"It's good for him."
"I could have helped you."
"She isn't anymore."
"I have a double call."
"Yes, I thought about it."
"I'm going to look for him."
"I'll call a taxi."
"You always knew it."
"In a car accident."
"I'll stay a little while."
"Can you wait a second?"
"Close the door behind you."
"Or something like that."
"There are children."
"Tell him to call me."
"All right, here we go."
"Ask anyone."
"And I agree."
"I know it by heart."
"As if it were possible."
"Consider it done."
"It's starting to get good."
"Maybe I am."
"I hope so for you."
"Good luck to you both."
"I have to take care of it."
"I want to see his face."
"You're deluding yourself."
"Nothing to do with you."
"She did not survive."
"I read your mind."
"I already said yes."
"Have you seen her before?"
"I saw it coming."
"He needs care."
"What you did."
"I kept you waiting."
"Can I ask you why?"
"All right, I'll go."
"How did she get there?"
"Thank you for waiting for me."
"I forgot the name."
"We should do something."
"No, never in my life."
"Thank you for this lovely evening."
"I want to have a baby."
"Everything will be fine for me."
"I do it for us."
"What's your thing?"
"I have served my sentence."
"Is there a phone?"
"I'm very proud of it."
"What if he's right?"
"Go back to where you came from."
"We have a lot in common."
"He came for me."
"What do we know about him?"
"You did your job."
"How old is your son?"
"There was a woman."
"There are more."
"Yes, we did it."
"We can take care of it."
"Go ahead, both of you."
"It's thanks to me."
"Far be it from me to think so."
"She had a stroke."
"How is your day going?"
"I like being with you."
"We just learned it."
"You have the answer to everything."
"No, I just arrived."
"So, what are you going to do?"
"We'll take care of her."
"Better not to know."
"Since when do you know that?"
"I'm dating someone."
"But this is different."
"I have to go back there."
"She's family."
"Don't you want to come in?"
"Nice to finally meet you."
"Try to get some sleep."
"How did you meet him?"
"I can come back later."
"It's the good life."
"And I love you too."
"We made a decision."
"But I have a plan."
"Everything happens for a reason."
"He just did it."
"There, I agree."
"It's about me."
"You will come with us."
"There is more important."
"Who will be eliminated tonight?"
"I wanted to make sure."
"It freaks me out."
"I have to earn a living."
"It happens like this."
"May I use your phone?"
"This is normal procedure."
"I'm right next door."
"You know what else?"
"I was in the shower."
"I need some information."
"I'll get to it."
"It's going to be a long day."
"I felt something."
"I'm from home."
"We have to move forward."
"It's about us."
"Where is my little girl?"
"This is what I am."
"Please come."
"It's a good movie."
"Since I'm telling you."
"He took everything from me."
"What did the police say?"
"It was just once."
"What do you want in return?"
"Who is inside?"
"It's just around the corner."
"Can you come pick me up?"
"I asked first."
"My throat is dry."
"You have to come with us."
"I can't sing."
"How long have you been married?"
"It's a nice surprise."
"It's in my head."
"It's going to cost you dearly."
"At the end of the street."
"The police are on their way."
"It is a heavy responsibility."
"He was a nice guy."
"Who shot you?"
"Can I have this dance?"
"I read your report."
"Nobody did it."
"Where did you see that?"
"I've already read it."
"I feel at home."
"These things take time."
"Can you give us a minute?"
"As you said."
"Isn't it wonderful?"
"How long are you going for?"
"It's on my list."
"Honey, please."
"I am another man."
"I'm at the airport."
"I gave it to you."
"Everyone on the floor."
"I'm sorry for everything."
"It's better for you."
"You look somewhere else."
"Isn't that right, Mom?"
"I got a promotion."
"I'm going to take the bus."
"Can I watch TV?"
"I only see that."
"I'm going to say hello to him."
"You make a beautiful couple."
"I'll go get the others."
"I have better than that."
"What are you going to call him?"
"Yes, she did."
"Does he have family?"
"What will she do?"
"She is in the kitchen."
"Peace be with you."
"He promised me."
"Because it is necessary."
"How did you get in here?"
"It's a special occasion."
"I'm going to the library."
"He came to me."
"Yes, it's very pretty."
"Are you coming for a ride?"
"Did you think of me?"
"And his last name?"
"You are always welcome."
"There is a catch."
"What is his real name?"
"How are you going to do that?"
"Let's not talk about this anymore."
"It's his first day."
"Where did you see it?"
"Glad you like it."
"He told me about it."
"I was thinking about something."
"Don't forget to breathe."
"At your command, my Commander."
"There is a word."
"He's your best friend."
"Am I making myself clear?"
"It is, isn't it?"
"That's what you're here for."
"What do I mean?"
"I'll go around."
"I hope to see you again soon."
"I read his file."
"I asked him why."
"All I want?"
"Are you on his side?"
"It took you a while."
"Do you need anything else?"
"Please stay."
"I just remembered."
"I didn't go there."
"You don't like them?"
"From head to toe."
"He is an old man."
"We were just talking."
"There are laws."
"Very good, that's good."
"It's in the contract."
"It might take a while."
"I'm going to call my lawyer."
"You have done your duty."
"She's going to have a baby."
"It's a family tradition."
"Do you want to see my room?"
"I am the strongest."
"He needed me."
"Mom, I have to go."
"The honor is mine."
"No, you don't want to."
"I'm going to get some coffee."
"You have beautiful eyes."
"That's for later."
"It's on the way."
"How is my little girl?"
"It's a good price."
"Come sit with us."
"But I have an idea."
"Yes, I read it."
"What's your head?"
"My God, it's true."
"Oh, I have to go."
"You don't need to."
"It's a private club."
"There is movement."
"She would have told me."
"Take him to the hospital."
"You know everyone."
"Have you seen his eyes?"
"Everything is going very well."
"Can we talk somewhere?"
"I do it for myself."
"That gives me an idea."
"I have to go back to town."
"It won't last long."
"Did you learn something?"
"Do you want to leave here?"
"How did he react?"
"I have to talk to him."
"You will be safe here."
"Don't let him in."
"We need proof."
"The pleasure is ours."
"I'm looking forward to seeing you again."
"You have to make a decision."
"Does your mother know?"
"Go sit over there."
"It looks perfect."
"You tell me something."
"I'm going to get a doctor."
"Who put this there?"
"Everyone to bed."
"Put it on the table."
"How did she get here?"
"Look at what you're doing."
"It was a good plan."
"It's not yours."
"Will you grant me this dance?"
"And what do I do with it?"
"I'm fine like this."
"Of course I want to."
"It's in his nature."
"No, I'm happy to."
"I'm sorry, guys."
"I am an open book."
"You fought well."
"Have you lived here for a long time?"
"Next, please."
"Thank you for talking to me."
"Okay, whatever you want."
"There is time."
"We're right in the middle of it."
"He is everything to me."
"I'm out of ammo."
"I thought you would understand."
"She looks happy."
"You did very well."
"I have no one left."
"I've seen some before."
"The sun is going to rise."
"I will continue to search."
"They told me."
"It's in the newspaper."
"I was told that."
"You have to promise me."
"Are there any others?"
"Will you excuse me for a second?"
"Yeah, something like that."
"Of course I understand."
"What can I offer you?"
"I thought about that."
"See you at lunch."
"What is this supposed to be?"
"I had an affair."
"It's an incredible story."
"There was something."
"Is that his real name?"
"The pleasure was mine."
"What's that over there?"
"I want to go there too."
"He is safe and sound."
"No, it was an accident."
"He was kind to me."
"They should already be here."
"I have them on me."
"You must know something."
"Is this supposed to comfort me?"
"Can I take your coat?"
"Time is against us."
"I received a letter."
"It's a little different."
"You can open your eyes."
"Can we talk for a minute?"
"Did you see it well?"
"This is my last day."
"What should I tell them?"
"I saw your car."
"I never do."
"Have you ever seen it?"
"I can't understand."
"You can count on us."
"I want to see my children."
"I vouch for it."
"Try not to move."
"No, not right now."
"I can do both."
"Do you really want to do it?"
"I need to understand."
"A decision must be made."
"She's not far away."
"I am not her."
"I have all day."
"I'm proud of him."
"The whole town is talking about it."
"I swear it."
"We'll get along well."
"Is this your girlfriend?"
"I found mine."
"I need a coffee."
"It's no longer worth it."
"When did you do this?"
"I remember it perfectly."
"You watch too much TV."
"He's in the back."
"He is on the roof."
"It's me, your father."
"No time for that."
"Maybe we should."
"If you want to follow me."
"No, I don't drink."
"You should come see this."
"Have you known him for a long time?"
"Can I stay a little?"
"Don't you like him?"
"This is a new record."
"I'm going to my office."
"That's good, man."
"Is this supposed to impress me?"
"Did I tell you that?"
"I forgot your name."
"Did you take anything?"
"It's fashionable."
"That's good, very good."
"Are you proud of yourself?"
"Some more coffee?"
"No, it's the opposite."
"You are like your mother."
"Have you seen the news?"
"We're on the case."
"What's wrong?"
"I'm done for the day."
"How did you end up here?"
"Let me be very clear."
"You are a big girl."
"How did I do that?"
"It's just dinner."
"I got out of it."
"That's the whole point."
"The director wants to see you."
"He is in the shower."
"I ask myself questions."
"I feel safe."
"I just want to see him."
"We keep each other informed."
"Until next time."
"No, I'm coming with you."
"In the glove compartment."
"That's good, my dear."
"There is a tunnel."
"I am a great admirer."
"I'll give you a chance."
"He is always late."
"Where do you know him from?"
"Because it's important."
"I always loved him."
"Where did you get them?"
"Where did you get it from?"
"I try to be."
"I would do it for you."
"Guess what it is."
"This is the right choice."
"If you want me."
"Is everything okay there?"
"I go where I want."
"Who doesn't like that?"
"I opened the door."
"I would have told you."
"It's an honor, sir."
"Yes, I promise you."
"I should have done it."
"What was in it?"
"I was just going to call you."
"A body was found."
"But I found this."
"Yes, I told him."
"I'll give it to you as a gift."
"I'll give you some."
"I brush my teeth."
"But you already know that."
"You are a good son."
"I feel really good."
"I am a married woman."
"No, not at the moment."
"He looked good."
"It's quality."
"All you have."
"I had to tell you."
"He did it on purpose."
"I've always lived here."
"Don't say his name."
"I really should go."
"I work for the CIA."
"This is the only possibility."
"This is a private conversation."
"I don't live here."
"He was asking for it."
"Haven't you seen it?"
"Take good care of him."
"Whose car is this?"
"We're in the right place."
"Maybe you were right."
"What are you all doing here?"
"He knocks on the door."
"I wish I could have been there."
"There are witnesses."
"Is everything okay between us?"
"It's almost dawn."
"I called the cops."
"She never came back."
"And not just any old one."
"You let him go?"
"Can't you do better?"
"I'm going to do the dishes."
"You are in great shape."
"More than you think."
"I am full of surprises."
"I love you, my baby."
"You'll never know."
"You already said that."
"You do your best."
"Where were you thinking?"
"It's going very well."
"We just talked."
"This guy is a genius."
"You are not pregnant."
"Everyone knows each other."
"He retired."
"Why are you talking about this?"
"Of everything and nothing."
"One foot in front of the other."
"How do I look?"
"I only want you."
"Do you remember his name?"
"This is what we know."
"I want to see my mom."
"It was just a kiss."
"I've always been there."
"It's for my son."
"It's a big house."
"Why do you want to do this?"
"Would you buy me a drink?"
"You thought of everything."
"We just talk."
"Nobody blames you."
"He's talking nonsense."
"Who else was there?"
"Everything's fine, sweetie."
"I don't think I can."
"This is what you are."
"How did you learn it?"
"Just tell me one thing."
"You've made your decision."
"I want to make a good impression."
"You have to make a choice."
"Who takes care of you?"
"And I apologize for that."
"Did you receive my letter?"
"I'll take care of it, boss."
"It's in the file."
"I can prove it to you."
"I saw the light."
"She didn't come home."
"Can I say a word?"
"It was given to me."
"I already asked him."
"Would you excuse us for a moment?"
"Can I have your number?"
"I'm from the CIA."
"It's nice of you to ask."
"I love you too, baby."
"It's windy."
"Did they find anything?"
"Smoking is not allowed."
"I have many friends."
"What can you tell me?"
"No, it's not the same."
"I go to church."
"I ask you the question again."
"I want him back."
"I owe you an explanation."
"What if it was me?"
"What time do you finish?"
"What am I getting at?"
"She is safe and sound."
"Tickets, please."
"I got rid of it."
"I just wanted to say hello."
"You are really very beautiful."
"I knew it would work."
"How much do you have on you?"
"He is on our side."
"She would never do that."
"We can do it here."
"You need to know."
"I will find another way."
"I still remember it."
"I went shopping."
"So what should I do?"
"The rain has stopped."
"He jumped on me."
"Come on, let's have fun."
"You changed your hairstyle."
"I'll see him later."
"I can keep a secret."
"I closed my eyes."
"I am in my office."
"When the time is right."
"Put that on my tab."
"I was hoping you would come."
"Don't you have a cigarette?"
"I am at your command."
"I'll try something."
"Attention all staff."
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
"This is my favorite song."
"I learned the lesson."
"I forgot my phone."
"That's just me."
"You didn't notice anything?"
"For me, it's the opposite."
"I have one last question."
"Just like that, all of a sudden?"
"I've said enough."
"Alright, I get it."
"Yes, I heard that."
"Why did he say that?"
"Yes, I have to go."
"No, it's fine, it's fine."
"It's a good school."
"What will become of him?"
"There's school tomorrow."
"I'll be right home."
"I want to call my lawyer."
"It works every time."
"Luckily I was there."
"Do you know where she lives?"
"Is that supposed to reassure me?"
"Because it's you."
"Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"I've heard stories."
"What a joy to see you."
"I know how it is."
"It's in their nature."
"That's an interesting idea."
"This is what I have."
"You shot me."
"This must not happen."
"It's a good book."
"I won't call him."
"You are under no obligation to do so."
"Please, gentlemen."
"You have company."
"You are a good girl."
"Someone has to go."
"You were very brave."
"That's really very kind."
"Have you seen my son?"
"Yes, I suspected that."
"His heart stopped."
"Which is the case."
"He is in my room."
"I wasn't hiding."
"I invite you to dinner."
"You are a free man."
"I prefer not to say anything."
"Did he say why?"
"Whose is this?"
"Please, darling."
"How are you, big guy?"
"Maybe next year."
"It's your turn now."
"I didn't believe it anymore."
"I owe him my life."
"Trust me a little."
"I have this for you."
"Is she always like this?"
"Let me do my job."
"Do you really want to go?"
"I'll take care of it now."
"We came for that."
"We all have a past."
"Up or down?"
"He's using you."
"A gift from my father."
"Sounds exciting."
"It's just a theory."
"I like to believe so."
"I'll do it for you."
"No, I have work."
"The result is the same."
"Are you going to hold out?"
"She is a beautiful woman."
"So what's the verdict?"
"You're doing whatever you want."
"I ask you the question."
"This is a delicate subject."
"We told each other everything."
"It's nice of you to stop by."
"She needs time."
"I'm going to the hotel."
"We have that in common."
"Let me introduce you to my wife."
"You're like a baby."
"It's really very good."
"Ah, is that it?"
"Thank you for saving us."
"I know where he's going."
"Did you do something?"
"Does this remind you of anyone?"
"Have you seen this girl?"
"I'm sorry about yesterday."
"But I'm still here."
"You heard very well."
"Ask for what you want."
"Call me back as soon as possible."
"A life is at stake."
"But I want to."
"It's for the baby."
"I can't say that."
"I am very happy about it."
"I'll call you when I arrive."
"I took the day off."
"If you want to."
"I'm in the area."
"He made his decision."
"But one thing is certain."
"Do you want some soup?"
"I love you too, darling."
"I remember it now."
"This is what I believe."
"Can you turn up the volume?"
"Maybe, I don't know."
"No, you won't go."
"Yes, that's her."
"Does it have a name?"
"What other choice do we have?"
"It must be this way."
"It's music."
"For real this time."
"I want more than that."
"I want to speak to the manager."
"I'll go get them."
"What will become of her?"
"This can't happen."
"Do you want some ice cream?"
"How did she take it?"
"I want to say something."
"You have a beautiful house."
"You're the one driving."
"I am a simple man."
"But I feel good."
"No one is safe."
"The exit is this way."
"Where is this noise coming from?"
"I've known this for a long time."
"All I can."
"I get paid for this."
"What will people say?"
"This is for my wife."
"I've known you forever."
"There is work to be done."
"I have it right here."
"Can I get you a coffee?"
"I am very grateful to you."
"Give him some water."
"Give him water."
"You have beautiful hair."
"She didn't move."
"Give me another one."
"She is a beautiful girl."
"They are making fun of me."
"It started like this."
"I would have remembered it."
"I go up to my room."
"How much did it cost you?"
"You've been had."
"It's part of the plan."
"Something happened to him."
"I just found it."
"I just got a call."
"More and more curious."
"Leave it, I'll do it."
"What is this game?"
"All I had."
"You should eat something."
"You can come with me."
"That's right, I forgot."
"A gift for the Gods."
"Merry Christmas to you too."
"I took a bullet."
"I was in the army."
"Can I have a hug?"
"It's physics."
"It's just a coincidence."
"This is the right place."
"We must continue to move forward."
"Who called the police?"
"We have to get used to it."
"He needs time."
"You didn't see?"
"I don't need it."
"It won't."
"But where have you been?"
"Where did they take her?"
"One in a million chance."
"I should have married you."
"I have to take a shower."
"I need peace and quiet."
"You're going home."
"Do you want me to answer?"
"It's very hot here."
"Twenty years ago."
"That would be a good idea."
"We received a call."
"That would be a good start."
"You're the spitting image of you."
"This is what I like."
"You need to see a doctor."
"There is still much to do."
"I really want to."
"Yeah, you could say that."
"You can come with us."
"I felt safe."
"How is he doing?"
"She told me about it."
"I underestimated you."
"It's the same person."
"Hence my presence here."
"I love you guys."
"Who was that on the phone?"
"Thanks for bringing it back."
"Just give me a minute."
"It's a good investment."
"I count to ten."
"It was just a suggestion."
"The Lord is with you."
"My mouth is dry."
"It's a big responsibility."
"You have arrived at your destination."
"What do I say about it?"
"I've already taken some."
"Is there a message?"
"The kitchen is over there."
"I apologize to you."
"He is not normal."
"I didn't eat."
"Yes, yes, it's true."
"But it's a secret."
"What is the good news?"
"How can they do that?"
"I saw you together."
"You are worth it."
"How many men do you have?"
"Yes, it's mine."
"No, it doesn't work."
"Because it's me."
"He's on the list."
"What am I to you?"
"Please come back."
"Do you want to add anything?"
"Put this on the table."
"This is the best way."
"I trust her."
"I need a change."
"I'm double-parked."
"Oh, I think so."
"No, he's mine."
"There is a witness."
"A friend of the family."
"We stick together."
"People come and go."
"What are we going to call it?"
"Thanks for thinking about it."
"It's going to make some noise."
"No, don't tell me anything."
"Go ahead, it's fine."
"Yet it is the truth."
"She wasn't."
"I want you to live."
"From start to finish."
"Are we going or what?"
"Thank you for your concern."
"It's over for him."
"Everything is in its place."
"It's just a formality."
"There will be consequences."
"Did you call the cops?"
"Who shot him?"
"Take him to the infirmary."
"My door is always open."
"How did it feel?"
"And how is it going?"
"This is the usual procedure."
"Maybe we should go home."
"We have another one."
"We all have one."
"Did you come for that?"
"We are like brothers."
"I love you, my friend."
"We all have our secrets."
"This is the perfect place."
"I only have him."
"Did she say anything else?"
"It's a big country."
"No, I don't know anything."
"You have a lot of talent."
"Yes, I saw them."
"You want me to go out?"
"It's the same guy."
"It was the right decision."
"It's my lucky charm."
"I'll give you my number."
"One step at a time."
"That's a nice sum."
"In the dining room."
"I meant to."
"Look how beautiful it is."
"I'll call him later."
"I want another one."
"You don't want to talk?"
"I told them everything."
"I always liked it."
"And there's more."
"A bet is a bet."
"It's all in the file."
"No, that's not enough."
"No, you don't have to."
"I expected that."
"I'm going to go to the bathroom."
"I'm going to pick up my son."
"How is this relevant?"
"We have an appointment."
"No, I feel fine."
"It was enough to say it."
"You know how she is."
"Repeat, please."
"You came back for me."
"No, we'll take care of it."
"That's my daughter."
"God told me."
"Well, it's done."
"How do you feel now?"
"No, I'm fine here."
"Come let me kiss you."
"The sun is going to set."
"You do that very well."
"Can you come for a second?"
"This will take a minute."
"What are these clothes?"
"I can't, Mom."
"What if I was?"
"One step after another."
"You are a good dog."
"It's a public place."
"Can I have a towel?"
"Ups and downs."
"You have it in front of you."
"He's just a kid."
"I'm in love with him."
"It's upstairs."
"It's silk."
"It was for your own good."
"And you, where are you going?"
"I'm going to try something."
"I'm moving on."
"I am her boyfriend."
"Are you even listening to me?"
"Go see who it is."
"Hey, I have an idea."
"You are on time."
"Like this, it's good."
"I wanted to say hello to you."
"That's just his style."
"Who did this to me?"
"I have enough to pay."
"I tried once."
"That's politics."
"Who came up with the idea?"
"I could be like you."
"I saw pictures."
"Have you seen him recently?"
"Not much to say."
"She is not pregnant."
"And that's how it is."
"I had a perfect life."
"Can we talk later?"
"I decided to stay."
"My name is Melinda Gordon."
"No, I'm sure of it."
"I never do that."
"All my best wishes for happiness."
"One day at a time."
"What would you do without me?"
"It seems to be working."
"He has always been there."
"I received a message."
"Are you happy with yourself?"
"I haven't decided anything."
"Just answer the question."
"It never ends."
"I remember very well."
"I want to go to the bathroom."
"Maybe a little more."
"It's a good song."
"How is this done?"
"I wouldn't mind."
"It's a big change."
"We can do it together."
"I know who they are."
"They didn't come."
"I have one more question."
"This color suits you well."
"I need to breathe."
"But I'm here now."
"Quickly, please."
"I am who I am."
"Do you have experience?"
"The cream of the crop."
"I'll call you tomorrow morning."
"I was in love with her."
"Everyone loves me."
"I want to see my husband."
"I have another plan."
"Isn't she pretty?"
"It will do us good."
"It was a long day."
"You are with me now."
"Is everything okay with you?"
"Maybe it's you."
"Do you want to do me a favor?"
"What did she answer?"
"This is an old photo."
"It's a lot of pressure."
"Never heard of her."
"You are a smart girl."
"See you in class."
"Six years ago."
"Did she really say that?"
"Do you want to go somewhere?"
"No, you did the right thing."
"Do you want to have a coffee?"
"It never stops."
"You didn't come."
"Let's do it and see later."
"For the good of all."
"She is not married."
"How can you think that?"
"It's like a drug."
"Wait for me in the car."
"At least I tried."
"Son, do you have a name?"
"When I have time."
"And you want to know why?"
"You're scaring me."
"Do you have something to write with?"
"This is a great story."
"You can change your mind."
"He knows everyone."
"Have you made a decision?"
"I'll stay with her."
"I'm not mean."
"I heard his voice."
"And she did."
"I can still fix that."
"That's the truth."
"I got your text."
"Sorry to have woken you up."
"Have you been doing this for a long time?"
"I loved this movie."
"If necessary, yes."
"Who told him that?"
"There is a mole."
"She has always been there."
"What is this due to?"
"It's an urban legend."
"What are friends for?"
"It may take a while."
"No last name."
"Do you want to be a hero?"
"I think you know."
"There is a girl."
"I'm all yours."
"I got used to it."
"This is a wonderful idea."
"He's just waiting for that."
"This is a personal question."
"I don't say anything anymore."
"You deserve to be happy."
"Can we take a picture?"
"Go ahead if you want."
"I need privacy."
"This is big news."
"He is a good friend."
"I'm on a track."
"I'll be around."
"It might be useful to us."
"I have company."
"This name is familiar to me."
"How did you come here?"
"I had never noticed."
"Do you want me to try?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, your attention."
"See you at work."
"We will go all the way."
"She doesn't like him."
"I've known you for a long time."
"It's self-evident."
"I'm going to walk home."
"I took notes."
"I love you, my brother."
"Is that your idea?"
"I need a taxi."
"That's what she's here for."
"I'll be there in a few minutes."
"So, where are we?"
"What's the name?"
"I am always with you."
"It's really very beautiful."
"You look like your father."
"Order whatever you want."
"I made some tea."
"I care about you very much."
"It's an interesting story."
"I said maybe."
"You were very kind."
"I reserved a table."
"I don't have a plan."
"It's a new day."
"There is change."
"The party is in full swing."
"I just got up."
"You know me so well."
"No need to say it."
"I'll do some research."
"Your father wants to see you."
"I know who she is."
"You have my full attention."
"This is the hardest part."
"You know very well that it is."
"What's got into you?"
"This is probably true."
"I have to find my son."
"I am a happy man."
"Because you know what?"
"Give him my regards."
"Who else is here?"
"I absolutely have to talk to him."
"So I did it."
"It's a nice place."
"And what if it's not?"
"I am not God."
"I'll let you get to know each other."
"They shot me."
"That's a surprise."
"He is retired."
"Aren't you introducing me?"
"My patience is running out."
"It just went away."
"Did you bring him here?"
"I took a walk."
"I have a better question."
"I'm taking him with me."
"Call me on my mobile."
"I have to be sure."
"Where does this music come from?"
"Where does all this come from?"
"I'm here, with you."
"Are you telling me that now?"
"I must have misheard."
"Go brush your teeth."
"I'm with you now."
"I'll be right behind you."
"I have to leave town."
"I didn't drink."
"This is the real world."
"What should I do with it?"
"He's a great guy."
"You better go home."
"He was a good friend."
"Yes, you must be right."
"What do you mean you can't?"
"Dad is home."
"You should have thought of that before."
"I'm proud of her."
"You will come with me."
"I don't go out much."
"How would I have known?"
"No, don't be."
"I am in a good mood."
"It's important to you."
"I've seen them before."
"You helped me a lot."
"I have to make a report."
"Yeah, you did it."
"You have a big mouth."
"And you, are you well?"
"He is in the house."
"Why are you coming home so early?"
"Very well, in that case."
"Can I have some more?"
"She's right, you know."
"Shall we talk about something else?"
"Take a leaf out of their book."
"You must be very proud."
"How could you know?"
"Do you want to know something else?"
"In the conference room."
"I brought food."
"I'd love a coffee."
"I need exercise."
"Were there people there?"
"Did they let you out?"
"I'll go there myself."
"Please, madam."
"No, isn't it?"
"I checked three times."
"Please listen."
"You're shaking like a leaf."
"Let us do our job."
"It was my first time."
"I am a police inspector."
"I'm overjoyed."
"But what is he talking about?"
"I just wanted to talk to you."
"They are ready for anything."
"I want to be like you."
"I left messages."
"I'm going to a party."
"It's a beautiful car."
"I should have listened to him."
"Maybe so."
"He is a wonderful man."
"It's just us."
"It's important to us."
"What is your name, sir?"
"I don't recognize her."
"Do you think I should?"
"By any means."
"Where were you this morning?"
"Will you do this for me?"
"I need proof."
"She's talking nonsense."
"What a small world it is."
"Can I talk to you frankly?"
"You can come to my house."
"Not because of me."
"I'm not there anymore."
"Can I come to your house?"
"It's a little better."
"Because I was there."
"It's drugs."
"Who do you think you're talking to?"
"I saw the photo."
"You said that."
"I'll get one."
"I prefer not to talk about it."
"I saw it clearly."
"It's okay, calm down."
"I have appointments."
"I'm going to pick up the children."
"Is it morning already?"
"There will be an investigation."
"I feel lucky."
"I have a quick question."
"Most of the time, yes."
"I read your articles."
"What's gotten into him?"
"Are you in love with him?"
"Oh, what's that?"
"This is a legitimate question."
"I always wanted to try."
"Thank you for being with us."
"Where did you meet her?"
"No, I want to do it."
"Are you giving me orders?"
"Eight years ago."
"They're making fun of us."
"It was a foregone conclusion."
"I am comfortable."
"It helps me think."
"Around the corner."
"What if he does?"
"It's a good job."
"Tell me about your father."
"You don't know that."
"It's okay, my baby."
"I could have stopped him."
"You are not him."
"I'd love to do her."
"I found something else."
"I wish you would leave."
"You know where to find us."
"And what do I tell him?"
"Yes, yes, I'm fine."
"Are you getting involved too?"
"He reminds me of someone."
"Some more tea?"
"It reminds me of my childhood."
"You are doing your best."
"I knew you would like it."
"She came to me."
"Yes, of course yes."
"The door is always open."
"That's a good answer."
"It's our only option."
"I took pictures."
"Why is it always me?"
"How could she?"
"What's up, brother?"
"I got a call."
"Do as you please."
"It has value."
"What is this song?"
"She is in the bedroom."
"No, it's yours."
"It's just a job."
"I will speak to you frankly."
"I need to go out."
"Don't answer the phone."
"It's just a story."
"It's his whole life."
"How long have I been here?"
"Let's not talk about it now."
"Not in that sense."
"Do you want to try your luck?"
"I've already said everything."
"I'm here on business."
"Someone took it."
"You have a lot in common."
"Because I like it."
"We have made a decision."
"Everyone knows her."
"But it will get better."
"Is there anything else I can do?"
"No, it's not over."
"You have to have faith."
"Sorry, that's just how it is."
"Shall I bring you something?"
"I heard them talking."
"Are you on the list?"
"It's the right size."
"I thought I did it."
"Oh, I'm sure."
"I'll go there."
"It's a good name."
"I've waited so long."
"I know where he lives."
"Now, please."
"My God, you're right."
"We have to go get him."
"Yes, I found it."
"You know it as well as I do."
"It's my turn now."
"Yes, we can say that."
"Or maybe not."
"I have beer."
"I'm not interested anymore."
"There is a door."
"She needed me."
"Is this humor?"
"Just a glass of water."
"No, I'm doing very well."
"How long does it last?"
"Do you have another one?"
"We'll do that later."
"Are you having a good evening?"
"What are we eating tonight?"
"Where did they send you?"
"You are a human being."
"I really need to talk to him."
"I know where to find her."
"Put it back in its place."
"Good work, everyone."
"But what should I do?"
"It's against my principles."
"Are you free tonight?"
"They are on the roof."
"Do you want to race?"
"Why did you marry him?"
"I have more money."
"Don't be in such a hurry."
"Do you go to church?"
"And how do I do that?"
"It's afternoon."
"No, I'm not leaving."
"It keeps me awake."
"Of course, I know that."
"She's not there anymore."
"There is evidence."
"Yes, how do you know?"
"Can I say one thing?"
"Close the door on your way out."
"A bullet in the chest."
"I am a new man."
"It's them or us."
"I am needed."
"You'll never see her again."
"She hasn't disappeared."
"And what is his name?"
"Something very important."
"No, it was my idea."
"It didn't last."
"And where is he now?"
"It's fine like that."
"I'm a good guy."
"Why are you so interested?"
"He's hiding something from us."
"How can you not be?"
"Few people know this."
"How dare you come here?"
"And what do you think about it?"
"I'll get some beers."
"What are you doing tomorrow night?"
"Who's at the door?"
"We did our job."
"You are not anymore."
"I have big news."
"I'll take the stairs."
"It was a beautiful day."
"No, I don't want anything."
"Can't wait?"
"It's different this time."
"He left the city."
"We can do that here."
"I should probably go."
"I want to make love."
"The best is yet to come."
"I changed my name."
"It's to protect me."
"That's what it's made for."
"I learned something."
"You are a nice girl."
"Come on, I'll introduce you."
"What's his number?"
"I'm coming right now."
"I only love you."
"Sorry, but it's true."
"Don't you have class?"
"I'm not far away."
"It will take your mind off things."
"Are you having a good time?"
"When did you learn it?"
"I'll be up in a minute."
"And what did you find?"
"I have to find someone."
"You know very well why."
"There is a snag."
"It's a beautiful song."
"You pay."
"You're not married?"
"I need light."
"I'll explain to you on the way."
"Have you been together for a long time?"
"Have you seen this woman?"
"How long have you been working here?"
"This is the first step."
"What is he here for?"
"Well, that's great."
"It's a big decision."
"I'm going out to get some fresh air."
"I know exactly what to do."
"Calm down, it'll be okay."
"I always wanted it."
"I need a cigarette."
"It will do for now."
"I am with friends."
"Who did you talk to?"
"I have a better one."
"Too good to be true."
"I don't know anything about it yet."
"So where was I?"
"I know him very well."
"I take my hat off to you."
"Is it time already?"
"What you said."
"They are lucky."
"Nobody can do anything about it."
"Yes, it is one."
"He is more than that."
"It happened here."
"I always keep my promises."
"You have to get out of there."
"So we're even."
"I'm beside myself."
"I was just doing my job."
"I was in love with him."
"I was very clear."
"I'm on the way."
"So what does that mean?"
"He is in perfect health."
"Can I leave a message?"
"It could have been you."
"I spoke to him yesterday."
"Have you seen my father?"
"They have no proof."
"What are we doing tonight?"
"Where there's a will, there's a way."
"Put it in the car."
"I'll stand guard."
"The doctor will see you."
"I need the phone."
"You ask a lot of questions."
"You work all the time."
"I'll use it."
"I'll be back in two hours."
"That's you, really."
"Let's see what happens."
"Nobody's going anywhere."
"You had to tell me about it."
"I come to say goodbye to you."
"It's a real maze."
"Ten minutes ago."
"It's Spanish."
"I must know the truth."
"I should go talk to him."
"Dad, this is for you."
"I know, I heard."
"I'm going to the kitchen."
"I just want to get it over with."
"Do you want us to leave?"
"Maybe next week."
"It was important to me."
"Patience is a virtue."
"I'm the one leaving."
"What did you have in mind?"
"She doesn't work here anymore."
"I need coffee."
"Yes, that's an idea."
"I'd rather not know."
"Do you have any beer?"
"What does that mean, exactly?"
"You know the funniest thing?"
"Two birds with one stone."
"Nobody knows anything about it."
"Yeah, that must be it."
"Sorry, we're late."
"Whose house is this?"
"I'm going to put an end to it."
"He is in my office."
"Thanks for the other day."
"Thank you very much for your time."
"Nothing is more important."
"This is my home too."
"You should be too."
"I have to call the police."
"It is at your disposal."
"And you believed her?"
"Where is the commanding officer?"
"I'm making something for you."
"How long have you lived here?"
"I never asked."
"Call me when you get home."
"Can you give me a minute?"
"She arrived this morning."
"I want you inside me."
"How long have you known him?"
"It's a day of celebration."
"I forgot my cell phone."
"Do you play guitar?"
"I have a personal question."
"I don't speak French."
"We'll take you home."
"The boss wants to see you."
"It will do him good."
"She's not interested."
"You have the right to do so."
"Thank God it's you."
"It's a real pleasure."
"Dad, I have to go."
"There is a passage."
"You could come with me."
"I want to do something."
"He is white as snow."
"My car is right there."
"Something is happening to me."
"Maybe she was right."
"There is a man."
"Yes, it's going very well."
"Do you know who he is?"
"Say it's Vincent."
"Because I'm here."
"You talked about me?"
"It looks fantastic."
"She didn't come back."
"You never will be."
"If I tell you."
"How long have you been doing this?"
"I really liked it."
"That's good, big guy."
"And you always will be."
"Don't you read the newspapers?"
"It is not available."
"You made a choice."
"Yet this is the case."
"I received orders."
"No, it's not going to work."
"Tell me where they are."
"And that's a good thing."
"What's her name again?"
"Is it going as you want?"
"You're a good kid."
"We've known each other forever."
"Everything will go very well."
"Would you mind explaining to me?"
"I don't recognize myself anymore."
"Yes, everything is going very well."
"Not all at the same time."
"Would you like some water?"
"You need to get out."
"Well, that's all."
"I am your big brother."
"Who will pay for this?"
"That's an interesting question."
"If you're there, pick up."
"Do you want some breakfast?"
"I learned from the best."
"It's in a week."
"I'm in the know."
"And you, what are you?"
"Thank you for joining me."
"I'll buy you a beer."
"In a quarter of an hour."
"It's his first time."
"It's a good exercise."
"I'll be back in two minutes."
"Isn't she wonderful?"
"I have all night."
"Good luck for the future."
"I haven't seen any."
"Let's see what you're worth."
"I'll tell him myself."
"Let me go home."
"That's good, my son."
"We have to find something else."
"And me, who am I?"
"This is the only option."
"What is the magic word?"
"I hope you come."
"Can you open the door?"
"So what did you do?"
"I know you understand."
"Oh, how cute."
"It's for school."
"Why did she say that?"
"It's food."
"I will take care of her."
"Everything will be fine, you'll see."
"That's good, guys."
"On tiptoe."
"It's in our nature."
"I'll go see that."
"If one can say so."
"He is a charming man."
"No, it's the other way around."
"I will never do it."
"We really have to go."
"You dropped that."
"Dad, can I talk to you?"
"And I need it."
"I want you to come home."
"What is the name of this place?"
"If it can help you."
"No, but I would like to."
"I like it like that."
"I did my research."
"I have a new job."
"We are all with you."
"You are a true friend."
"I'll show you the way."
"Do you have better things to do?"
"Would you do me a favor?"
"In a day or two."
"And there is this."
"We are like a family."
"Do you want to be my friend?"
"Yes, I love you too."
"Have you made your choice?"
"I'll sort this all out."
"I never thought about it."
"I saw you do it."
"Who would do something like that?"
"Did he do something?"
"It was a great idea."
"I need cash."
"Congratulations are in order."
"That's quite a coincidence."
"We will be safe there."
"Sorry about the other day."
"It's like a game."
"They never came back."
"I took a picture."
"I want you to know."
"You don't do it."
"This is an excellent choice."
"Do you want to leave a message?"
"I return the compliment."
"Yes, from time to time."
"At least, I thought so."
"You're going to have a baby."
"He's a beautiful baby."
"That's what marriage is."
"We're having a good time."
"He is in the office."
"Because I'm black?"
"I brought something."
"It just came like that."
"Have you been to war?"
"He is a good father."
"At any cost."
"You are a lucky man."
"Nobody asks you."
"You don't want this."
"I read the newspaper."
"Did they say something?"
"I saw a man."
"But what were you thinking?"
"Just give me a second."
"Let's see what you have."
"She is not human."
"Are you high or what?"
"It just happens."
"I'm glad to be leaving."
"I'm on a date."
"Come in and close the door."
"Only time will tell."
"Can I take a ride?"
"I needed to talk."
"He's making fun of you."
"I love everyone."
"I have more questions."
"Are you thinking of someone?"
"He seemed nice."
"Who wouldn't?"
"Look at yourself in the mirror."
"It's a lovely place."
"No, I have to do it."
"We have to give it a try."
"This is my favorite part."
"I forgot the rest."
"She was a good woman."
"Would you mind following me?"
"No time to talk."
"No, I'm late."
"You knew this would happen."
"Supply and demand."
"I don't think anything about it."
"It's our little secret."
"I have every right."
"Is it already that late?"
"Have you ever seen any?"
"We can give it a try."
"You owe me an apology."
"She doesn't think so."
"It's just a phase."
"Do you know how much it's worth?"
"I forgot my key."
"It is a wise decision."
"Reinforcements are on the way."
"It never happened to me."
"I just called him."
"It's payday."
"You're a good cop."
"What's the address?"
"I count on your discretion."
"I never liked him."
"I should call the police."
"It's in the manual."
"What does he think about it?"
"Do you know who you are?"
"This is a good omen."
"What is this disguise?"
"I saw the future."
"Four days ago."
"Open the outer door, Hal."
"You have to let her go."
"Okay, whose turn is it?"
"No, it's not cool."
"I'll get the key."
"It's a beautiful piece."
"You're out of the woods."
"I'm right, aren't I?"
"Didn't he tell you anything?"
"I would never do it."
"The right age."
"It was on TV."
"Go wait in the car."
"He's from the CIA."
"Tell us where he is."
"I've known her forever."
"She left the hotel."
"He tells me something."
"I have something here."
"I need a volunteer."
"We owe him that."
"Was it good last night?"
"I can't imagine."
"No, it's not you."
"It needs to be taken care of."
"I hope that will be enough."
"It was a beautiful ceremony."
"It was luck."
"They are in the area."
"It's a bit long."
"She didn't have any."
"I needed to think."
"Do you want to take care of it?"
"He is in the building."
"Who would have guessed?"
"They are capable of anything."
"This is how it goes."
"Could you be more specific?"
"Do you think you're at home?"
"I'll take care of it, darling."
"Nice talking to you."
"Have you heard anything?"
"It's good for her."
"I will always remember it."
"We'll see each other later."
"You wouldn't."
"He is a remarkable man."
"One last one for the road?"
"We are at the hospital."
"It looks like he's sleeping."
"You are full of surprises."
"Thank you for asking me."
"I'm his girlfriend."
"I went to see her."
"Come back, please."
"You told us."
"I found a job."
"I have to go get her."
"We'll remember later."
"I want to go with you."
"Are you in the know?"
"When will this end?"
"And I saw it."
"Face the facts."
"Same as him."
"What is this bag?"
"Age before beauty."
"She left town."
"Do you think this will work?"
"You can tell me about it."
"You didn't notice?"
"Did you leave a message?"
"Because you are here."
"You're good at this."
"How are we going to find him?"
"Because I loved him."
"You are a smart boy."
"Let's go, kids."
"This is a brilliant idea."
"No, I've had enough."
"The Lord is my shepherd."
"You will never find her."
"He volunteered."
"I have good reasons."
"It makes perfect sense."
"Take care of your mother."
"I will be by your side."
"No, I don't see anything."
"I'm not a kid."
"I like helping people."
"You still don't understand."
"It's common sense."
"I don't accept that."
"The target is in sight."
"He's still a child."
"You will need me."
"You have a beautiful voice."
"Take me in his place."
"It's curfew."
"You are an intelligent man."
"No, I'm not going."
"Did he find something?"
"It's a nice gesture."
"You are not human."
"She wants to take my place."
"Is it that bad?"
"I took a shower."
"I am an old friend."
"I'm a good girl."
"You won't be."
"I live right next door."
"I have made my arrangements."
"What do you want to do now?"
"Nobody touched it."
"It's getting dark."
"She can't speak."
"It's halftime."
"He crossed the line."
"I want to make myself useful."
"Close the door when you leave."
"We're leaving in an hour."
"No, don't apologize."
"It must make sense."
"It's a wonderful place."
"You're a little late."
"I knew he would come back."
"I finished my shift."
"What do you think, doctor?"
"You have to be sure."
"She is a wonderful woman."
"I left a note."
"You have blue eyes."
"I have a new plan."
"I need a car."
"Are you from the CIA?"
"We are happy for you."
"Tomorrow is my birthday."
"It's a big fish."
"I should go too."
"Did you make love?"
"I'm putting you on hold."
"I have crossed the line."
"I take care of myself."
"She came to my house."
"It was a simple question."
"She shouldn't have."
"You did it well."
"I took the test."
"It's a good car."
"Do you see what's happening?"
"It's for the family."
"You know how I am."
"Here is what I propose."
"Because I am."
"I thought you were my friend."
"It's in the trunk."
"How are you sure?"
"You have no messages."
"We had an argument."
"I saw him leave."
"But I'll tell you."
"Choose what you want."
"I have to go see her."
"This is an important step."
"Thank you for trusting me."
"There is a change."
"In the blink of an eye."
"I misjudged you."
"It's just a party."
"I stopped counting."
"You were never there."
"Wait, what are you talking about?"
"We'll see each other tonight."
"No, it wasn't me."
"Ask for whatever you want."
"You will thank me one day."
"It came by itself."
"It needs a name."
"They took everything from me."
"Don't say another word."
"No, it's not necessary."
"I see who it is."
"Who sent you here?"
"Or someone else."
"We will do everything possible."
"There's nothing at all."
"At least for now."
"What did he write?"
"There is an intruder."
"My father taught me."
"I have one left."
"You didn't see me."
"She never came home."
"It's really very simple."
"Things are different now."
"So they say."
"We'll talk about it again tomorrow morning."
"Maybe I should have."
"It's observation."
"He's my brother-in-law."
"This is a great plan."
"I want water."
"Was I not clear?"
"You heard the lady."
"Everything ended well."
"I'm going to set the table."
"Have you seen the video?"
"You may know him."
"He is at school."
"I brought this back for you."
"I've always liked you."
"Like two drops of water."
"I will never know."
"Something stronger?"
"You can trust us."
"He was my mother's."
"I leave the choice to you."
"The Force is with me."
"He was a good soldier."
"He doesn't work here anymore."
"She doesn't wake up."
"Nothing to do with us."
"It's a beautiful city."
"There is turbulence."
"This is one of mine."
"It's in the head."
"Were you going to tell me?"
"And the day after."
"I want to see the body."
"So we agree."
"Did you get my message?"
"You owe me a beer."
"I grew up with him."
"You can count on that."
"I'm going to call someone."
"But there is more."
"I saw my mother."
"I've never met him."
"I'll spare you the details."
"As I did."
"Do you have any coke?"
"What do we do with her?"
"You are still so beautiful."
"I think it's very good."
"A little fresh air."
"For me, it is."
"Can you live with that?"
"It's more like that."
"I wanted to hear your voice."
"He is in good health."
"One good thing done."
"Not at all, actually."
"I must speak to him immediately."
"She deserves better than this."
"Are you sure you're okay?"
"What are you dressed as?"
"You have nice eyes."
"You have crossed the line."
"I called the hospital."
"May they rest in peace."
"It's for good."
"At least we're together."
"You have become a man."
"It's for your safety."
"What must happen will happen."
"I'll try something else."
"Can we go faster?"
"You are our only hope."
"You really did it."
"No, she can't."
"She did it on purpose."
"Do you want to take a shower?"
"No, I'm not well."
"All means are good."
"No one will see the difference."
"That's all, I think."
"Everyone will know."
"She tells me something."
"You get straight to the point."
"I want to be your friend."
"Put that on my account."
"We're going to go around."
"Very well, I will."
"He is a good doctor."
"What's the program?"
"I just wanted to let you know."
"She's still a child."
"And I know about it."
"One of two things."
"She never came."
"As if you care."
"I want to go out."
"I called twice."
"Can't you hear it?"
"It was a good job."
"You don't have them."
"I'm on the list."
"He needs to know."
"No, I'm not coming."
"I will remember you."
"I'll be there in five minutes."
"One thing after another."
"Yes, and you know what?"
"There was something else."
"Everything will go as planned."
"I need to drink."
"They don't know anything about it."
"He was a nice boy."
"Did he do it?"
"Have you read the newspaper?"
"Dinner will be ready soon."
"And I believed it."
"I'll be back in ten minutes."
"He is like his father."
"Who shot me?"
"You owe him that."
"Take the time to live."
"I'll wait a bit."
"Is this supposed to be me?"
"The Lord be with you."
"It would do me good."
"I'm going to the grocery store."
"Say 'please'."
"I love you, my heart."
"What's the point of that?"
"It's a nice house."
"Maybe he was right."
"It's more than likely."
"This is mine."
"Does she have family?"
"He is a good person."
"It's clear and straightforward."
"It feels really good."
"Things will get better."
"It always ends like this."
"It made me laugh."
"I say goodbye to you."
"I'm going to take a nap."
"It was a good evening."
"She gave it to me."
"I didn't choose."
"I'm on the train."
"What is this guy?"
"You didn't ask?"
"You won't believe it."
"I will need you."
"She is in love with you."
"You are welcome, gentlemen."
"You will never believe me."
"She's in the know."
"I'll do it now."
"Can you tell me why?"
"How much time do you have?"
"It's a family business."
"I'm in charge."
"We are the same age."
"I don't want her."
"You are a real hero."
"You don't want that."
"Seven years ago."
"It's the same man."
"Trust your instincts."
"No, I need it."
"Do you think you can do anything?"
"We speak the same language."
"I know the perfect place."
"It helped me a lot."
"Until our next meeting."
"Can everyone hear me?"
"I made an effort."
"Maybe we should wait."
"All of them."
"This is one of the reasons."
"I'm happy for her."
"For me, it's good."
"I feel in good shape."
"How are you, my boy?"
"I'm thinking of something."
"You can't go there."
"It's a great movie."
"Have you noticed anything?"
"Yes, that's true."
"How was your date?"
"I'm having a good time."
"It's a private reception."
"Where is he taking us?"
"How did you find that?"
"This is a great opportunity."
"When is it planned for?"
"What class are you in?"
"I'm free tonight."
"We can do without it."
"Do you see me like that?"
"This is what they do."
"They came to my house."
"You don't want to stay?"
"That's the right word."
"He looks like his father."
"You must have faith."
"I let myself go."
"Yeah, yeah, that's it."
"Did you discover something?"
"Everything I love."
"I'm a good cop."
"I'll take a look at it."
"It's in the kitchen."
"That's more than enough."
"But it will take time."
"You have to go now."
"I like this boy."
"Do what they ask."
"Everyone will be happy."
"This is confidential information."
"I don't drink it."
"I know, that's all."
"How many fingers do I have?"
"It happened to you."
"It's better for him."
"I looked at your file."
"It's a huge responsibility."
"I think you should."
"This is my last prize."
"It's all in the past now."
"Can I talk to you outside?"
"I'm right in the middle of it."
"I wish you the best."
"I'll be out in a minute."
"By the sea."
"Where are the other two?"
"That's what they're there for."
"How long will you be staying?"
"You're a real friend."
"I already have a job."
"Are you saying that for me?"
"I exercise."
"Clean as a whistle."
"I took classes."
"What is this attitude?"
"I have great news."
"It's a big piece."
"I never saw her again."
"No, don't do it."
"They are at home."
"It's time to move."
"I see things differently."
"Everything is for the best."
"It's a beautiful evening."
"What is his first name?"
"You sound like your father."
"The hospital just called."
"He is under my responsibility."
"I met him yesterday."
"What do they have in common?"
"Sorry to barge in like this."
"You don't recognize him?"
"This is the new me."
"Do what she says."
"Where did I put it?"
"You can never be too careful."
"See you up there."
"Nobody did anything."
"At least, for now."
"Where is the meeting place?"
"I wish I had known him."
"Let's get down to business."
"That's a bit extreme."
"The line was cut."
"I have it with me."
"Well, I don't think so."
"All right, see you later."
"But it suits you."
"I read lips."
"Can I place one?"
"You'll pay me for this."
"What's the title?"
"How much did you pay for it?"
"I've seen your movies."
"This is the official version."
"Are you guys ready?"
"Have fun, guys."
"I'm pumped."
"I know you by heart."
"I think I see."
"I'm going to do something."
"They won't know."
"What am I accused of?"
"You have half an hour."
"I travel through time."
"This is our only way out."
"Come closer, please."
"I forgot my hat."
"You are my little girl."
"Do you want some aspirin?"
"I thought I'd find you here."
"I must be something else."
"I need an answer."
"I would never do that to you."
"I'll pass the message on to him."
"Yes, she's mine."
"What if she's right?"
"I want to check something."
"I met a woman."
"The police were called."
"I don't fight."
"It gives me chills."
"I have a lot of money."
"We're taking him with us."
"I'm going to fill up."
"I work in a bank."
"Your secret is well kept."
"Monsters don't exist."
"I never will be."
"Put it with the others."
"You have good eyes."
"No, I saw it."
"He is in love with me."
"You're my best friend."
"They're coming for us."
"Ticket, please."
"Can we see each other tomorrow?"
"Do you want to talk about that?"
"I'll have the same thing."
"How can he do that?"
"I'm making you an offer."
"I would like to say the same."
"I will be outside."
"What could I have done?"
"Can I borrow your car?"
"My reputation is at stake."
"Is there any gas?"
"Does it make you feel good?"
"I'll give you a price."
"There is a map."
"You changed my life."
"Can you afford it?"
"You should come more often."
"He's upstairs."
"She can't hear you."
"There will be a trial."
"I have all the papers."
"I have to go to bed."
"I will take care of them."
"You're not finished yet?"
"I'll go see up there."
"It might take some time."
"Caught red-handed."
"Was school good?"
"There are enough."
"Which hotel are you staying at?"
"I am self-employed."
"You weren't."
"He went through there."
"This is good stuff."
"But what if it were true?"
"Sorry about the other night."
"I needed time."
"Can we take a look?"
"You must know one thing."
"You won't find it."
"I work for the FBI."
"Yes, I feel good."
"A mint candy?"
"I came to talk to you."
"I heard you talking."
"This time it's done."
"My name is Benjamin Linus."
"It's for my daughter."
"I just thought of it."
"I need something."
"I have to go out for a while."
"Are you telling me the truth?"
"But of course not."
"I've never seen you."
"No special treatment."
"I'll meet you downstairs."
"I got your messages."
"Have you finished your homework?"
"I have water."
"He took his time."
"I have loads of them."
"Who do they think they are?"
"I've known her for a long time."
"They didn't take anything."
"He had his fill."
"Who is this young man?"
"I have to go get him."
"How long will he be here?"
"That's the whole question."
"We are one."
"You know what, guys?"
"Did you let him go?"
"And a year of joy."
"I heard things."
"Should I call the police?"
"See you at the wedding."
"The law of the strongest."
"Have you ever been in love?"
"It's inside."
"This is the easy part."
"No more than the others."
"Your name, please."
"They've been there."
"Yes, you can say that."
"I'll get him out."
"This is perfect for you."
"On a whim."
"It's his birthday soon."
"It's a special day."
"Say it to my face."
"You're not going to say anything?"
"It makes me nauseous."
"This is the next step."
"What a pleasure to meet you."
"Come up, please."
"She's just a girl."
"Have you had any news?"
"Yes, it's right here."
"She's upside down."
"It's all in your head."
"If I remember?"
"Same time next week?"
"It can't be that."
"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
"We should all go."
"It's been a long road."
"Look how beautiful she is."
"She overdosed."
"Do you want to play cards?"
"She didn't think so."
"When did you know?"
"I had a good reason."
"I hear music."
"It is sure and certain."
"And how are you going to do it?"
"Was I at that dinner?"
"You're hiding something from us."
"You see, it's easy."
"They are all like that."
"We'll take a look."
"I would like to be sure."
"Who gave this order?"
"They let me go."
"You've never tried."
"He's her boyfriend."
"I want to make a deal."
"We have to hold on."
"Have you never seen one?"
"This is the right address."
"It looks wonderful."
"We can go together."
"What if no one comes?"
"It must be so."
"Good aim, good shot."
"Can I have some coffee?"
"I'm going to go talk to them."
"I need a signature."
"It makes all the difference."
"She is a charming woman."
"And we leave."
"Do you think you scare me?"
"You've done your homework."
"I feel pretty good."
"It's a foregone conclusion."
"You are in good health."
"I know where they are going."
"This is his last chance."
"Miss, please."
"I'll be there in ten minutes."
"The idea is mine."
"We told you."
"That must be a record."
"What needs to be done."
"I would never say that."
"Don't say otherwise."
"Of course, right away."
"Please what?"
"He just woke up."
"It really makes me happy."
"We want the same thing."
"She reminds me of someone."
"I'm at the door."
"We're all going to go through it."
"What are we talking about here?"
"We're going to do something."
"I'm going to the police."
"You have to go around."
"I'm beginning to believe it."
"This is what we have."
"Come out, please."
"I ask myself the question."
"I don't think about it anymore."
"It's for kids."
"What is he getting at?"
"Where did this photo come from?"
"How are you two doing?"
"The cycle of life."
"Where is he heading?"
"Tomorrow is a big day."
"I'm going to close my eyes."
"Do you want to see a picture?"
"What do you want exactly?"
"Do you want to make yourself useful?"
"What does your instinct tell you?"
"How do you know this name?"
"Are you expecting visitors?"
"Glad you're back."
"Two bullets in the head."
"It's a beautiful party."
"Did you really say that?"
"The toilets are over there."
"Yes, that's the idea."
"There is a photo."
"I spoke to the director."
"Tell him to come here."
"I'm going to get someone."
"It's on the right track."
"It's perfect for me."
"You can't say anything."
"I have big plans."
"Do you live with your parents?"
"I am with a friend."
"I didn't choose anything."
"You need a vacation."
"And who is that?"
"Yes, I read that."
"Has anyone seen her?"
"Why are you telling me about it?"
"The charges were dropped."
"Shall we play hide and seek?"
"We got fucked."
"Who wants to party?"
"Would you like another drink?"
"You caught me off guard."
"We go in and out."
"One question at a time."
"You've had enough."
"It comes from there."
"You are our last hope."
"I still have time."
"She didn't say it."
"What are you going to do to us?"
"I know how to use it."
"My car is in the garage."
"I was told everything."
"I don't take any."
"Look what we have."
"I'm going back to the hospital."
"Is this beer?"
"Can't you see me?"
"Do you want it or not?"
"I would like to say a few words."
"It was a good thing."
"What's it like up there?"
"No, I don't care."
"This is a sensitive subject."
"We're having fun, aren't we?"
"Isn't that right?"
"You owe me an explanation."
"And what is it for?"
"It sounds simple."
"If we have time."
"Are you going to say something?"
"Have you read it yet?"
"Can I get you something else?"
"I promise you, Mom."
"You are a good mother."
"It was a new age."
"I expected better."
"What's his thing?"
"No one can say."
"Vehicle permit and papers."
"I'll be down in a minute."
"You came looking for me."
"Maybe it's serious."
"Yes, I heard you."
"He always did."
"She's hiding something from us."
"Do you see all these people?"
"There is a way out."
"It cheers me up."
"That's what he's here for."
"Breakfast is served."
"I'll be there in two minutes."
"Where did the other one go?"
"You needed me."
"I'm going to open the window."
"What are these questions?"
"I just want to have fun."
"We'll finish this later."
"It's not for sale."
"They are in the house."
"Yes, that's the one."
"This is how we will proceed."
"It's a start, right?"
"We've always done it."
"You understood very well."
"It's like talking to a wall."
"What are these manners?"
"Do you want some pie?"
"What condition is she in?"
"I'll do that later."
"Is this justice?"
"This is our best lead."
"I am by your side."
"I have to check something."
"Where can I reach you?"
"You are not ready."
"Can I come see you?"
"He's in the know."
"We have done our duty."
"What is this man doing here?"
"Don't ask me how."
"Exactly what I wanted."
"It's your first day."
"You didn't listen?"
"No, I didn't do anything."
"He's giving me the creeps."
"I will come back as soon as possible."
"She's doing her best."
"Are you proud of me?"
"Not necessarily in that order."
"Have you seen your mother?"
"You are not normal."
"You are his best friend."
"Everyone knows you."
"You told me about it."
"Beautiful, aren't they?"
"No, we don't know."
"I never knew."
"She is an old lady."
"What condition is it in?"
"The whole family is there."
"She doesn't talk to me anymore."
"There is a possibility."
"It's mine too."
"I just figured it out."
"Because of my father."
"I'll show you your room."
"I came home early."
"So, what do you want to do?"
"No, I wasn't sleeping."
"I'm going to the car."
"I just want to see you."
"Is there any room left?"
"Have you seen it before?"
"I think he's asleep."
"He's doing a good job."
"I'll make coffee."
"How many do you have left?"
"Thank you, I will repay you for that."
"I wish you good morning."
"They look good."
"It's our livelihood."
"A deal is a deal."
"I know where you live."
"You had to take care of it."
"Can I play with you?"
"It's a one-way ticket."
"Let's take cover."
"I get up early tomorrow."
"They are right behind us."
"You might need it."
"I'll read it to you."
"I decided to leave."
"She won't go far."
"It should have been you."
"I have a pass."
"But what have I done?"
"You did all that?"
"That was last year."
"She changed my life."
"There is a place."
"Ladies, please."
"And it was."
"She gave this to me."
"Passport, please."
"This is my big brother."
"I came to say goodbye."
"You know how they are."
"There was a lawyer."
"It's easy to understand."
"I'm asking you nicely."
"It's time to start."
"Call me when you get back."
"It's you or me."
"Ask me anything."
"I'm going anyway."
"He is in nature."
"Don't shout like that."
"It's near here."
"I was going to come see you."
"It's on the list."
"Let's see what it is."
"This one is mine."
"These are two different things."
"I did it too."
"In the waiting room."
"There is one condition."
"I have plenty to spare."
"I don't know, Tony."
"They're just waiting for that."
"Are you related to him?"
"What he said."
"It is a military operation."
"Of course, you are right."
"Of course, you're right."
"It was for work."
"I'll make him talk."
"It's a pretty dress."
"The door is wide open."
"But I saw you."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"He looked normal."
"I'm fine and you?"
"What if I do?"
"I never go there."
"Have you found a job?"
"I don't want to live."
"We're going three."
"Would you mind leaving us?"
"I will come back another time."
"Have you eaten anything?"
"But it is very important."
"You're still the same."
"I was in my room."
"Psychopaths and writers."
"He changed my life."
"We're going to do this right."
"That's the truth, isn't it?"
"I want to do this well."
"Are you back together?"
"And that's an order."
"Did you find someone?"
"This is research."
"This one is for you."
"There are only two of them."
"I go back to the car."
"All right, here we are."
"Tell me where you're going."
"Your parents must be proud."
"Let's not be late."
"He opened his eyes."
"She's in my pocket."
"I can only imagine."
"I'm still your father."
"That's all for you."
"He will take care of you."
"It's for TV."
"I'm not here anymore."
"Do you remember anything?"
"I'll put it another way."
"You have read my file."
"Welcome to the Ocean Club."
"I'll ask you the question again."
"He looks like it."
"Do you want to have dinner with me?"
"For security reasons."
"It's gasoline."
"I have to go, darling."
"I don't speak English."
"Everyone has it."
"Is all this true?"
"What are they going to do to us?"
"Because I loved you."
"I'm going to go freshen up."
"Maybe I should leave."
"You have to tell me everything."
"I'm going to get a beer."
"You have to start somewhere."
"I heard your conversation."
"As I tell you."
"She only has me."
"I know how he thinks."
"He has a lot of work."
"Are we on air?"
"She is at school."
"I have to get back to it."
"It worked for me."
"Do you want some beer?"
"You came to see me."
"I never wanted this."
"Did you receive my letters?"
"Do you see how it works?"
"It's in two weeks."
"I want to play with you."
"Honey, I have to go."
"What do we know about her?"
"I want to try something."
"I'll get to the point."
"They can't do that."
"I forgot mine."
"It's a little chilly."
"Give me a leg up."
"You will see for yourself."
"I went to war."
"He's going to need it."
"I called security."
"I can't concentrate."
"I was looking forward to this."
"Wait, I'll take care of it."
"It's not there anymore."
"Cash or credit card?"
"Are you thinking of something?"
"The light went out."
"It's in his interest."
"Let's see where this takes us."
"But what have you done?"
"I want to see him now."
"Did you notify the police?"
"One, two, three and four."
"I was at church."
"Someone high up."
"How did you meet her?"
"I'll tell you how."
"She is like her mother."
"Can you wait a minute?"
"Did someone call me?"
"Look him in the eyes."
"What's the deal?"
"This shouldn't happen."
"I got the answering machine."
"Call if needed."
"Calm down, everything is fine."
"Oh yeah, that's it."
"They had their chance."
"Are there any deaths?"
"She looks like her mother."
"You will tell him yourself."
"He saw something."
"But I like you."
"I haven't changed anything."
"It's packed."
"I will make the introductions."
"I did the army."
"I'll wait for you downstairs."
"You're the expert."
"Can I have a soda?"
"I have a toothache."
"You don't recognize her?"
"Have you seen the others?"
"I always wondered."
"We can count on him."
"Did they tell you that?"
"You saw the plans."
"You haven't learned anything."
"They don't talk to each other anymore."
"You are part of me."
"I already called him."
"And what should I do?"
"It's just an accident."
"It's always been me."
"Put this in your pocket."
"Take a look at this."
"I solved the case."
"I assure you it is."
"She was in my class."
"Vital signs are good."
"Put them on the table."
"I have so many questions."
"Where is the investigation?"
"Are you ready to order?"
"Yes, of course, I understand."
"This time I'm going."
"She's your best friend."
"Who is this young woman?"
"You are safe and sound."
"Everything will be fine for you."
"Is he breathing?"
"Because I'm pregnant."
"They may have left."
"Here's what I know."
"This is what it looks like."
"I'll bring you something to eat."
"I've heard it before."
"He's a good match."
"Yes, that's why."
"I promise you I won't."
"It's part of me."
"It's better than that."
"We'll get through this."
"She was a nice girl."
"I was passing through the neighborhood."
"It's going to be okay, buddy."
"You're the one responsible."
"It's been a while, huh?"
"She doesn't have a boyfriend."
"I read your letter."
"I have to call my mother."
"I just want the truth."
"There are exceptions."
"Only one at a time."
"Do you have something to write about?"
"I found that."
"I will never say it."
"I can't think."
"How old are you now?"
"This is indeed the case."
"It's my brother's."
"That's the only difference."
"I am a reasonable man."
"I ask you for a moment."
"Can we get out of here?"
"I have a good memory."
"I prayed for him."
"I love you, goodbye."
"She left a note."
"Maybe not for you."
"I have to get back to the lab."
"Do you want to be my wife?"
"We'll find one."
"Not in front of everyone."
"You want to tell me why?"
"Don't ask any questions."
"Well, where is he?"
"See you downstairs."
"Let's not talk about him."
"Will you call me later?"
"We'll come back to this later."
"Would you like to eat something?"
"It's important, I hope."
"What is your last memory?"
"I'll tell them everything."
"This is my private life."
"The end of the world is coming."
"I'm setting off."
"I'd like something to drink."
"She is not happy."
"I have a new one."
"I found someone."
"What if it was you?"
"And the answer is yes."
"What about freedom of expression?"
"Shall we have a beer?"
"I have to say something."
"Where do you want to start?"
"Tell your mother."
"Of course, Mr. President."
"She is a lovely girl."
"What kind of world do we live in?"
"You can tell us."
"I'm staying in the area."
"It's a bit heavy."
"For me, it's important."
"I just told him."
"We will find another solution."
"He may be sick."
"There is a policeman."
"I'm going back to the beach."
"He really did it."
"It's for their own good."
"It's going to take hours."
"She won't make it."
"Do you know who we are?"
"No, I'm just passing through."
"Did you like the movie?"
"It might be serious."
"What's the number?"
"I'll get some glasses."
"Ah, that feels good."
"I saw you coming."
"The icing on the cake."
"You should have been there."
"She's my soulmate."
"This is my ex-husband."
"How many did you take?"
"There's a little left."
"And that's where it ends."
"It must be the heat."
"I checked twice."
"Take some rest."
"Anything and everything."
"He is at the hotel."
"We'll take it back for you."
"The master has betrayed us."
"I want to speak to the director."
"There's not much."
"She didn't eat anything."
"Have you met before?"
"No, I gave up."
"Everyone knows me."
"Very well, thank you."
"How should I take it?"
"I called several times."
"It will do for this time."
"I was at school."
"I want to take a picture."
"Let's take a closer look."
"I'll call security."
"It belonged to my mother."
"I'm going to sit there."
"That's how life is."
"I did things."
"Something had to be done."
"Do you have it on you?"
"It wasn't them."
"It's in the book."
"So, are you leaving?"
"If you want to leave, leave."
"I am ready to pay."
"He doesn't know anything about it."
"I really liked him."
"I have to go, Mom."
"It's a bit far."
"Bring him inside."
"Yes, I will go."
"Do you want to party?"
"You don't want it anymore?"
"Since when have you been interested?"
"I arrived on time."
"I'm in a cabin."
"She was my mother's."
"You are a great man."
"It's over for the two of us."
"It's in the genes."
"You almost had me."
"I think I can."
"Two boys and a girl."
"You are a man now."
"It's all over between us."
"What are you trying to prove?"
"How did I end up here?"
"Hence your presence here."
"They found a body."
"It's quite a process."
"It's meant to be."
"He is in your office."
"Maybe me too."
"I already told them."
"How long have you known her?"
"Can I come in for a minute?"
"What's this guy's name?"
"Go fuck yourself."
"I wish you success."
"I'm going to see the police."
"He has a good head."
"How are you, my friend?"
"It's an old trick."
"I take care of others."
"Not to that extent."
"You didn't know her."
"What if I'm right?"
"He is at university."
"You have to take care of it."
"He paid in cash."
"What is this job?"
"Have they reached the Shire?"
"I am many things."
"It must run in the family."
"Who is not there?"
"I never came."
"You're on air."
"Is everything okay around here?"
"What did you call him?"
"I need to know more."
"I want to see his file."
"It's for girls."
"I'll stay with him."
"What if she says no?"
"It could have been us."
"Same as me."
"I want to go to bed."
"You're making things up."
"You're out of luck."
"This is slavery."
"This is a private meeting."
"Have you seen the newspaper?"
"I am a busy man."
"I'm going to call my mother."
"Will you keep me informed?"
"It helps pass the time."
"I see perfectly."
"It's a bit personal."
"I'm in insurance."
"I could come with you."
"They left this morning."
"I'm going to take my shower."
"The appointment is made."
"Do you have alcohol?"
"I'll leave you to yourselves."
"Have a little faith."
"We'll take care of him."
"That's a lot to take in."
"My mother and my father."
"What are you going to do then?"
"I always have a plan."
"He's my best friend."
"If you say so, sir."
"Good luck to all of you."
"I know where to find you."
"You must be aware."
"As you did."
"I'll take care of it, sir."
"They call it the Worm?"
"She's worth it."
"You are the doctor."
"I'm a nice guy."
"The controls are no longer responding."
"So how is he doing?"
"I took a bath."
"We are close to the goal."
"It should go well."
"I'll take my coat."
"Yes, it's right there."
"You see I'm delighted."
"It's on the table."
"Show me how you do it."
"Have you seen my wife?"
"He would be proud of you."
"I was in the car."
"I discovered something."
"Let me introduce you to my friends."
"So where are you from?"
"You don't know how to hit?"
"I can get you out."
"Was the day good?"
"Everyone is having fun."
"One second, please."
"It should be possible."
"No, I'll manage."
"One can only hope."
"Have I been clear enough?"
"I am a light sleeper."
"I love him too."
"She is in great shape."
"No, it was something else."
"Can you take us there?"
"I can walk on my own."
"He served his sentence."
"Can I trust him?"
"This is a good opportunity."
"You still have time."
"The car keys."
"I can't do more."
"She was my father's."
"Everyone adores you."
"Can anything be done?"
"Why do you always say that?"
"We count to three."
"This is an important moment."
"Can you give me one?"
"But they did."
"I've never seen one."
"Send someone else."
"It was just a test."
"That's exactly why."
"I must leave the Shire."
"Or I'll call the police."
"What condition is he in?"
"Have you had it for a long time?"
"I had to get out."
"I want to make sure."
"I'm going to clean all this up."
"What's the secret?"
"I saw your file."
"I don't know, boss."
"I'll have to think about it."
"Come, I want to talk to you."
"It warms the heart."
"I am responsible for you."
"You should have said so."
"Did I miss something?"
"Of course, I remember."
"Yes, yes, it's me."
"Two and two make four."
"Someone might see us."
"But she did."
"The body is still warm."
"I love you my dear."
"We'd better go home."
"No, that's how it is."
"No, it's too hot."
"You did this to me."
"I wish I could have seen that."
"This cannot happen."
"It wasn't the same."
"What can I say to him?"
"This applies to you too."
"We'll find another one."
"What is your name, soldier?"
"What are you doing to us now?"
"I'm doing very well."
"Is this within your capabilities?"
"Did you want to say something?"
"They look nice."
"Don't do this now."
"No, no, no, it's okay."
"I'm going to have a son."
"Because you love him."
"Yes, he just arrived."
"Can I call someone?"
"You need us."
"This is a good offer."
"Did he give it to you?"
"They let him go."
"What's on your face?"
"You better come inside."
"It was a real pleasure."
"There was reason to."
"You know something about it."
"Water will do."
"And there is better."
"Of course, I will."
"Anything else to say?"
"You know everything about me."
"We need to think bigger."
"Do you want to take my place?"
"No, but thank you anyway."
"That, we can say."
"They didn't say."
"Did you tell them that?"
"I'll take another one."
"It's part of the deal."
"You will always be welcome."
"A friend of a friend."
"You don't know that?"
"I voted for you."
"I can't fly."
"Now that you mention it."
"We have to do it now."
"He owes me a favor."
"We are a big family."
"What did she take?"
"And where are you from?"
"Do you want me to talk?"
"Do you want pizza?"
"If that were the case?"
"It's for babies."
"What's the question?"
"Didn't he tell you?"
"Just a quick look."
"It is divine intervention."
"I wish I could have done more."
"Have you ever spoken to him?"
"It's all old."
"Oh, yeah, that's true."
"You'd think you were hearing my mother."
"I have confidence in myself."
"He is a good soldier."
"He is a smart boy."
"And I'm going to prove it."
"I got your call."
"He is still in surgery."
"You just have to see."
"It doesn't depend on me."
"I had a hunch."
"For a lot of reasons."
"He's playing with us."
"Can you explain this to me?"
"Have you seen your father?"
"You had me followed?"
"You want me to resign?"
"No, we're leaving."
"The bedroom is over there."
"I want you to understand."
"I'm on the road."
"But you shouldn't."
"She'll be right back."
"Great work, everyone."
"We have plenty to do."
"I haven't tried."
"Until the last drop."
"I will be back soon."
"How can you not love it?"
"I read the book."
"She should already be here."
"I want that to change."
"We make a good duo."
"I have a lot to learn."
"You'll never have it."
"I'll give you a ship."
"I got your note."
"Do you want to talk about it now?"
"You're at home here."
"I can do it too."
"You're on speakerphone."
"Very well, as you wish."
"You didn't answer me."
"Why did you bring him?"
"I can't talk right now."
"Can you give me your number?"
"It's going to be okay, sweetie."
"Yes, I received it."
"Is he sleeping?"
"Maybe she knows."
"I want to see my mother."
"What had happened?"
"I saw your photo."
"I don't really understand."
"I thought you were leaving."
"Did you close the door?"
"They knew we were coming."
"I'll take care of the tickets."
"The bar is over there."
"What's the next step?"
"Is it good or not?"
"I never get tired of it."
"I don't forgive you."
"Do you want to say hello to him?"
"Do you remember them?"
"And it feels good."
"She's passed out."
"He's coming straight towards us."
"Where it all began."
"Don't trust them."
"So why did you come?"
"You're a big boy."
"You just have to try."
"She is in the shower."
"Did it give anything?"
"She's a great girl."
"What if it was him?"
"I have to live with this."
"I'm late again."
"I'll get a taxi."
"So where is the money?"
"She is a little shy."
"You're putting on a show."
"Oh yes, I remember."
"Just what I wanted."
"This is the correct answer."
"And you said yes."
"It's already a start."
"It looks like it does."
"Six weeks ago."
"Tell me about your wife."
"I don't speak Italian."
"It's time to choose."
"It might as well be you."
"You didn't ask for anything."
"I'm going to make sandwiches."
"For whatever."
"It's just a hunch."
"This is a secure area."
"Everyone was there."
"It's kindness."
"Did you tell him everything?"
"So I'm coming with you."
"I worked with him."
"I heard a voice."
"You don't know each other?"
"What do you know about them?"
"I'll be inside."
"He is from the police."
"It's just the wind."
"Yes, that's his name."
"How do you know his name?"
"It's the human condition."
"I'm saying this for you."
"It's a bit fast."
"What's it like there?"
"Can I go see him?"
"Thank you for being there."
"He's in the garage."
"You've said enough."
"We got a call."
"Nobody heard anything."
"Focus on your breathing."
"Welcome to our humble abode."
"Are we doing business or not?"
"I will take care of it personally."
"Need I say more?"
"She wrote a book."
"Something to tell me?"
"She needs care."
"I'll tell him everything."
"What did you do then?"
"Let's make ourselves comfortable."
"How is he, doctor?"
"Are you seeing another woman?"
"You're hiding things from me."
"It is a university hospital."
"She always did."
"I had a flash."
"Yes, I went there."
"He has experience."
"It's a magical place."
"I'm in the middle of a meeting."
"Are you taking me home?"
"This is a fantastic idea."
"That's good, my little one."
"As soon as I'm finished."
"I have it in mind."
"Only one thing interests me."
"You will never find it."
"But there is better."
"The two girls can leave."
"Don't say that word."
"She's in the phone book."
"Am I not?"
"Do you want to play the hero?"
"I wish I had known."
"You are in a hospital."
"An hour, maybe two."
"That's how it is here."
"Route change in progress."
"I am an FBI agent."
"They did not survive."
"We didn't touch anything."
"I know, I saw."
"Shall I tell you a secret?"
"I count to five."
"Is she breathing?"
"Go in and close the door."
"What should I do then?"
"I saw this movie."
"How could I have known?"
"I'll keep that in mind."
"I know, it's good."
"Here we are safe."
"It seemed important."
"The lights went out."
"I thought you were in bed."
"I looked on the internet."
"I'm coming back from the hospital."
"You'll love this place."
"No, I'll talk to him."
"I had never seen him."
"It's a bit light."
"She doesn't talk to me."
"It's my favorite color."
"If only it were that simple."
"Has she seen a doctor?"
"No, I won't."
"Bring me some water."
"We'll go through there."
"I'll take care of it personally."
"I left home."
"How is she, doctor?"
"You have to accept their conditions."
"No, it's a gift."
"You made a promise."
"Everyone loved me."
"I saw my father."
"Yes, I heard it."
"I'm leaving in two days."
"I spoke to the prosecutor."
"She is always late."
"He's in my head."
"I received your letter."
"I know you very well."
"I had a few drinks."
"Do you know where I live?"
"I have a big mouth."
"You have little time."
"This kind of thing happens."
"Thank God it's over."
"Would that have changed anything?"
"I suspected it."
"You already have one."
"She didn't call."
"Maybe that's good."
"It is a scientific fact."
"Please pick up."
"I saw his body."
"It's not very far."
"It happens to all of us."
"And I said yes."
"And your last name?"
"You don't."
"I really feel better."
"Two nights ago."
"Is there anything new?"
"Better to leave it at that."
"She doesn't live here anymore."
"Guys, let's go."
"Focus on my voice."
"Is it time?"
"Did you swallow your tongue?"
"Are you coming for a drink?"
"A real fairy tale."
"No, you're not coming."
"Let's stay out of this."
"He lives with his mother."
"It was my last chance."
"It's right across the street."
"Look how beautiful you are."
"Take him inside."
"You would do the same for me."
"I play the guitar."
"She is a young girl."
"It's just a dog."
"Have you known her for a long time?"
"It's better for us."
"There is a code."
"I have to go change."
"She has a big mouth."
"I worked for him."
"I'm going to the infirmary."
"No, I've already tried."
"I'll be back in a few days."
"I agree with him."
"Don't you have anything else?"
"All systems are ready."
"I'm in the lobby."
"We still have one chance."
"He is a real gentleman."
"Tell me where and when."
"It was for fun."
"You barely know her."
"I didn't have any."
"I won't allow that."
"That is, me."
"I love you very much too."
"Do you want some popcorn?"
"I have a little gift."
"I'll take one too."
"She takes after her mother."
"You are responsible for him."
"So what is it for?"
"But this is the last one."
"But what is it for?"
"They know who you are."
"A dog bit me."
"I'm spending the night here."
"An investigation is underway."
"I'm going to the beach."
"You're going to tell me."
"Because it's over."
"That would be a good thing."
"It had to end like this."
"I don't remember anymore."
"Actually, you're right."
"She is a smart girl."
"It's a beautiful thing."
"I have a few."
"There is a party."
"We're going to do it."
"Everything looks good."
"I need company."
"She made her decision."
"Like before."
"What is the real reason?"
"I'll look downstairs."
"Did they tell you?"
"It's a simple formality."
"Take her in your arms."
"He had us good."
"I want to see your face."
"Late, as usual."
"Who needs this?"
"I'm going to call my wife."
"We are at your service."
"Go ahead, spill the beans."
"Do you have another solution?"
"He may have left."
"It's in our interest."
"Whatever that means."
"I filled up."
"I'm expected in court."
"I can let you in."
"I'll get the truck."
"Because you deserve it."
"It looks deserted."
"Is it for the money?"
"She's not sure."
"We have one hour left."
"No, that wasn't it."
"There is food."
"And I will always be here."
"Can you pass me a towel?"
"Listen to me, both of you."
"Where should I put this?"
"But what's wrong?"
"He owes me one."
"Come let me introduce you."
"How can I do this?"
"You need reinforcements."
"Do you want a hot dog?"
"This is a crucial moment."
"Yes, it's time."
"Are they all yours?"
"How many do you need?"
"I need to check."
"You never asked."
"This is my favorite movie."
"The voice of his master."
"You have all the time in the world."
"Why are you telling me?"
"When did you see it?"
"What do we have on him?"
"There will be one."
"I was just joking."
"You have two new messages."
"I just walk."
"Okay, that's good."
"I know a good place."
"We're going to call the police."
"This is for you, Dad."
"Have you ever been married?"
"You are my whole life."
"You're mine now."
"That's everyone."
"I've been around."
"Give me half an hour."
"I did that too."
"They changed their minds."
"Did he tell you why?"
"No, I'm not finished."
"But not all the time."
"I had to come back."
"But that's where it ends."
"He has many friends."
"Who discovered the body?"
"I'll write you a check."
"Take time to think."
"I will answer your questions."
"What did you want to ask me?"
"It's often like that."
"Have you set a date?"
"I like to think so."
"It's for life."
"It must mean something."
"I will never see you again."
"And I'm still here."
"To the bathroom."
"Do you have other children?"
"See you at the game."
"I need some equipment."
"I hope you do too."
"Give me a second chance."
"A life for a life."
"Everyone is fighting."
"You don't talk to me anymore?"
"You get that from me."
"I want to trust you."
"Do you want action?"
"With great power comes great responsibility."
"Yes, of course, of course."
"Is this your home?"
"We all know."
"I don't have a brother."
"Do you have enough money?"
"Everything you wanted."
"Did you find the body?"
"I just wanted to protect you."
"It's a closed case."
"I don't recognize him anymore."
"You are my little brother."
"It's just a movie."
"What works?"
"No, it's a surprise."
"Previously on The O.C."
"You shouldn't drink."
"It was him or us."
"It's just a name."
"I came to warn you."
"Only if you want to."
"You're going to pay for this."
"I want to tell you everything."
"I live with my mother."
"We don't know anything yet."
"We still have work to do."
"Why did he come here?"
"And they did."
"Good job, everyone."
"This time it's true."
"You have no way out."
"I notified the police."
"And I have to believe you?"
"We are human beings."
"Where is the safe?"
"My wife and my son."
"Countdown begins."
"Did you have someone?"
"She can't breathe."
"It's okay for now."
"How small the world is."
"I can fix that for you."
"I'll be back right away."
"What are you made of?"
"But you said it."
"Yes, I can see that."
"What year was that?"
"You betrayed my trust."
"Yeah, I heard that."
"She is in love with him."
"There you go, that's much better."
"This is the right attitude."
"Are you going to the hospital?"
"I read the letter."
"I am here with you."
"I'm going to the doctor."
"You're a nice guy."
"Is everything okay between you?"
"What if we sat down?"
"You are a brave man."
"It's in two days."
"No, I didn't see anything."
"We're going to take a picture."
"Don't start without me."
"I have a wonderful idea."
"I will be in my quarters."
"In the top drawer."
"I want to get out of this."
"Is this what it's about?"
"This man is a genius."
"Do you think I can?"
"I'm good for nothing."
"This will be the last time."
"I welcome you."
"We will continue to search."
"For now, at least."
"She didn't do it."
"Mom, can I talk to you?"
"We have to trust each other."
"You liked it, huh?"
"What you have to do."
"Tell me about your family."
"I just wanted to introduce myself."
"The jury is back."
"There's that too."
"No, it's too far."
"Anyway, I have to go."
"You owe me a favor."
"How did they find it?"
"I'm getting you out of here."
"Nobody warned me."
"You're not a man."
"You got it."
"Oh, I did it."
"There are cameras."
"Do you think you're God?"
"I have to tell the truth."
"I'll wait for him here."
"No, we're just friends."
"So, where do we start?"
"You would do the same thing."
"I have some change."
"I took one."
"I saw her too."
"Maybe a little bit."
"Yes, he is my son."
"No, it's already done."
"Why did you go there?"
"I was born for this."
"What did you want to talk about?"
"I have to look."
"Who else is involved?"
"I'll be right next door."
"You are good people."
"What more does he want?"
"I checked it myself."
"We'll talk about it tomorrow morning."
"Are you going to use it?"
"You see, I was right."
"Thank you for breakfast."
"I'm good at this."
"Are you planning to do this for a long time?"
"It's in the phone book."
"But you have to do it."
"Not as good as you."
"And I am happy about it."
"I'll tell Mom."
"What exactly do you mean?"
"I'm going to leave for a while."
"Give me one more chance."
"Don't talk about him."
"How long has she been here?"
"He is like my brother."
"What's wrong with your arm?"
"I want to be with him."
"He'll be right back."
"No one will ever know."
"Should I put on some music?"
"Someone has to tell him."
"He works for the government."
"No, they can't."
"We have to go to the hospital."
"It's my middle name."
"Yes, I'm staying online."
"I have to meet someone."
"Have you been married for a long time?"
"There was a boy."
"Can I take notes?"
"Take someone else."
"You know, for the kids."
"No, I did it."
"I felt it too."
"She is on our side."
"I'll take my jacket."
"This way it's better."
"Up and down."
"I forgot my jacket."
"Why are you telling him that?"
"And what do we do now?"
"It's nice to see."
"You don't get along?"
"I'm trying to improve myself."
"I am with a patient."
"That's what I was talking about."
"See you up top."
"Shall we go to my office?"
"He came to my house."
"This is quite a surprise."
"What did they ask you?"
"No, I can't do it."
"The best for last."
"What does all this have to do with it?"
"No, but it's true."
"I need a lawyer."
"It's his age."
"I've always done that."
"Would you mind doing it?"
"We don't have anything better."
"For over a year."
"One for one."
"And you know it well."
"I'm past that stage."
"Can I clean the room?"
"He was my father's."
"No, don't get up."
"They weren't there."
"He's my half-brother."
"What is what?"
"I won't say more."
"Here we are, guys."
"Nobody tells me anything."
"It's for the principle."
"I'm going to get a soda."
"Is this a good move?"
"I'm going to bed early."
"What am I supposed to say?"
"You seem nice."
"By any means necessary."
"Have you kept in touch?"
"I take care of you."
"Do you take it like that?"
"I am with a client."
"I live just across the street."
"Are you offering it to me freely?"
"I've never seen them."
"He was right behind me."
"Give him money."
"I still have questions."
"Am I in the right place?"
"He did his duty."
"Do you have space?"
"Not what you think."
"I just received them."
"Few people can."
"I'm interested in you."
"Everything is fine, my boy."
"Yes, I said that."
"I want to give this to you."
"Go to the other side."
"No, but it's good."
"I'll be in the kitchen."
"You have to trust us."
"I still have a few questions."
"They look delicious."
"I have to see my son."
"It's to our advantage."
"He might be there."
"It's all going to be okay."
"No one can do that."
"He arrived this morning."
"That's the question."
"I am leaving next week."
"As far as you know."
"And you believed it?"
"He is the one responsible."
"Where do you know each other from?"
"I rented a car."
"But everything is fine now."
"You are a good horse."
"But what was I thinking?"
"I have fulfilled my contract."
"I had a baby."
"I will pass the message on to him."
"I'm coming to see a friend."
"It comes at just the right time."
"So we all say."
"Yes, that's my name."
"She won't listen to me."
"He is an important man."
"You can take mine."
"I'll take my bag."
"Family is sacred."
"Have you been working here for a long time?"
"It's such an honor."
"There are worse things."
"Who is this handsome man?"
"You kept your promise."
"Later in the week."
"It's contraband."
"It's important to her."
"And what did you answer?"
"Oh, that's very good."
"It's for my work."
"Come inside, please."
"Put this in your mouth."
"Don't react like that."
"I prefer not to think about it."
"I can still do it."
"You should take a vacation."
"Someone you know?"
"Who doesn't?"
"Everyone to work."
"Now I don't know anymore."
"What are you doing in town?"
"Did I make myself clear?"
"Alert to all units."
"Yes, that would make me happy."
"It's much more important."
"Do you remember everything?"
"And you didn't say anything?"
"Are you going to get back together?"
"I didn't speak."
"Take care of yourself, okay?"
"You still have a choice."
"Oh, I agree."
"The wind has risen."
"I was waiting for that one."
"I'm happy too."
"What did you dream about?"
"This is for your protection."
"It must be done now."
"I hope this helps."
"You were so kind."
"They passed by here."
"It's luck."
"Who wants some pie?"
"I have it on me."
"There's no one else."
"Yes, it is quite possible."
"We will see that later."
"There is noise."
"Nice to see you again, sir."
"It has always been like this."
"Call me as soon as possible."
"I had him come."
"She is at her mother's house."
"How are you doing, girls?"
"I'm being taken care of."
"You say it like that."
"I got you good."
"Did you really do that?"
"I should have told him."
"What do you think of them?"
"I want to make peace."
"It's an election year."
"Don't you miss it?"
"I saw his picture."
"Thank you for believing in me."
"It was a good match."
"I want a normal life."
"Tell me who it was."
"No, I promise you."
"I might need it."
"You're a good girl."
"Money is needed."
"Man of little faith."
"I take care of him."
"Who spilled the beans?"
"I'm going to get something."
"Are you giving me a hug?"
"I'm having a little fun."
"Do I really have a choice?"
"Will you give me one?"
"With the greatest pleasure."
"It's quiet tonight."
"It is better to be careful."
"There is a car."
"No, I'm still here."
"How did she do that?"
"I think about that."
"I came by your place."
"It was just a game."
"I never knew him."
"Yes, I will remember it."
"And she's a woman."
"I ordered coffee."
"Inspired by a true story."
"You don't like me anymore?"
"He's like my brother."
"There is hope."
"Who is the king?"
"Oh, that feels good."
"I need love."
"He has a lot of talent."
"I'm coming to pick up my wife."
"She can't come."
"You will never have it."
"It's in the closet."
"Together we catch killers."
"Can I take your coats?"
"I met a guy."
"You're pissing me off."
"What was on it?"
"I'll tell you what, man."
"You have piqued my curiosity."
"It happened last night."
"I want her to leave."
"I have a good reason."
"You better get out."
"I was abroad."
"A little more coffee?"
"She means a lot to me."
"Is there a connection?"
"We've heard this before."
"And where are they now?"
"No, it's this way."
"They were very clear."
"I thought it was good."
"And I have to go."
"Do you have anything to write down?"
"I know where to start."
"You are part of the People."
"Do you need this?"
"Are they always like this?"
"I have enough friends."
"You're starting to piss me off."
"I have a busy day."
"My nephew and niece."
"It was like a dream."
"You mean like that?"
"Tell him to hurry up."
"I'm in the shower."
"They took my son."
"We'll meet there."
"Of course not, darling."
"I've never experienced that."
"Eat whatever you want."
"Have fun tonight."
"I got the role."
"Do you know who they are?"
"I'll get the coffee."
"Good luck to you too."
"You don't talk much."
"You were going to tell me?"
"She made a choice."
"I want to work with you."
"I can promise you that."
"And what did you see?"
"As I planned."
"They're a good team."
"No, I found it."
"You are retired."
"A bullet in the back of the head."
"She's using you."
"When did you get married?"
"Do you want to take a look?"
"It's a new era."
"Do you think we can?"
"This is how I know."
"Don't play this game."
"You know what, buddy?"
"I should have stopped him."
"They will take care of you."
"We made a bet."
"Until proven otherwise."
"It's just a loan."
"Within reason."
"Go there right away."
"Can anyone attest to this?"
"Who wants some ice cream?"
"I work for the police."
"I've never felt like this."
"I make you a promise."
"If you can hear me, answer."
"This is good coffee."
"I'll get the rest."
"You really love him, huh?"
"I already explained to you."
"Where is the corkscrew?"
"There is a boat."
"Is this the right direction?"
"No, I want to."
"I have to get rid of it."
"No, no, it's true."
"How long have you had it?"
"And I've had enough."
"You are the writer."
"What are you going to do, Lamar?"
"Luckily he was there."
"I'm going to get the votes."
"But I agree."
"There is an exit."
"I thought so with you."
"It's the same for you."
"They must have spotted us."
"You've got something there."
"That's it, of course."
"Do you want to go see him?"
"I did a test."
"His wife left him."
"It's ice."
"This is the best place."
"What is he accused of?"
"That's saying something."
"You look stressed."
"Because I'm hungry."
"What if it was her?"
"Are you interested or not?"
"I almost died there."
"I want ice cream."
"I feel lighter."
"Here we go, buddy."
"You should have seen her."
"It does something to me."
"Because of your mother?"
"I received the message."
"We'll do as you wish."
"How did all this happen?"
"Someone should do it."
"Come on, this is going to be fun."
"Have you reached your verdict?"
"Try to remember that."
"Who is he talking about?"
"Good night, and good luck."
"Tell him we're coming."
"How could it be otherwise?"
"Everything is upside down."
"Will you excuse me for a moment?"
"What did you do there?"
"Do you play an instrument?"
"You'll have to follow me."
"I advise you to leave."
"Have you spoken to him recently?"
"Change is good."
"I found the solution."
"This is the big moment."
"We have to try."
"I was beside myself."
"Don't let her down."
"I'll show them to you."
"It's all over the news."
"We must make an example."
"She is no longer here."
"Do you know where he's going?"
"Call me when you can."
"This is my little boy."
"I have just one question."
"I did the job."
"I'm in the dark."
"Come down, please."
"Not a penny more."
"Do you want some coke?"
"That's enough for now."
"He changed his name."
"I'm making breakfast."
"What does your heart tell you?"
"I'm so lucky."
"Thank you for telling me that."
"I finally found it."
"One day you will thank me."
"My God, this is amazing."
"Straight ahead and left."
"You don't look like it."
"You played very well."
"I met a man."
"Don't attract attention."
"We're on the right track."
"Will you let me go?"
"He is different from others."
"What's your first name?"
"You haven't paid."
"Did you let him do it?"
"He has a big mouth."
"Not at this hour."
"This is my first mission."
"Thank you for meeting me here."
"We'll be back in an hour."
"I have asthma."
"I'm going to buy something."
"I read the reports."
"But how do you know?"
"And what do I gain from it?"
"I brought some wine."
"He's quite a character."
"Don't say that, Mom."
"You'll get along well."
"Don't miss your train."
"I'm going to go see them."
"Do you want to make a fuss?"
"No, it's fine like that."
"An idea comes to me."
"Where did you take her?"
"He is also my son."
"Can I take the car?"
"Everything is fine, my love."
"You are my last hope."
"You should be more careful."
"I brought him here."
"The rest is up to you."
"It looks real."
"Where are you going with that?"
"It's a hot dog."
"No, I want to go."
"Your appointment is here."
"I needed the money."
"Don't you want to sit down?"
"It's in the Constitution."
"It's safer here."
"I'm taking her home."
"She is a good friend."
"You have to say something."
"You haven't eaten?"
"This night is yours."
"Please move along."
"He came to get me."
"She may have left."
"No, I shouldn't."
"You weren't ready."
"If you change your mind."
"Maybe I should go home."
"I did all that."
"Can you go get it?"
"I was just asking that."
"She is different from others."
"He is the strongest."
"It's for fun."
"I find it very interesting."
"He is in the room."
"I'm just the messenger."
"This one is for me."
"Fifteen years ago."
"I'm in the elevator."
"It's painting."
"Are you sure you want to?"
"I always think of you."
"What are you referring to?"
"I'll take a look over there."
"I have a good job."
"Where's your head?"
"I apologize for him."
"It's going to be your party."
"No, I'll take it."
"I'll be back in two days."
"Is there a doctor?"
"What's that smile?"
"I don't count them anymore."
"That gives us time."
"Does it ring a bell?"
"It had never happened."
"That's the whole difference."
"She was a little girl."
"A road accident."
"The house was searched."
"I signed a contract."
"What are you still doing standing up?"
"I'll take care of it immediately."
"It's just my business."
"You do it for yourself."
"Everything will work out in the end."
"I'll find another one."
"He looks normal."
"I saw his eyes."
"What grade are you in?"
"Someone we know?"
"Don't call him that."
"You are a beautiful woman."
"Nice to talk to you."
"And the rest of the time?"
"Who does he think I am?"
"I need details."
"I have faith in him."
"I hope I did well."
"You are a good doctor."
"A little gift for you."
"He did his job."
"Are you going to mass?"
"No, I'm his father."
"I didn't know them."
"Do you want to know something?"
"Did you have an affair?"
"I'll come up right away."
"Do you need him?"
"Is this the only reason?"
"Nothing to do with that."
"You'll find something."
"Isn't she lovely?"
"No, I would remember it."
"Is that the reason?"
"Can I take a bath?"
"And I believe in you."
"Are you in or not?"
"Yes, it's very good."
"You can trust them."
"Do you have any ice?"
"I think you can."
"You must already know this."
"I need caffeine."
"What if I did?"
"Let's do what he says."
"Who will take care of it?"
"I found this too."
"Why did you take it?"
"Glad you're doing well."
"Do you still want to take me?"
"No resurrection ship."
"It was the good life."
"Not to everyone."
"Am I on speakerphone?"
"I made an appointment."
"He is on the road."
"That's it, goodbye."
"I'm doing it on my own."
"This is your home too."
"I wanted to make myself useful."
"Stand against the wall."
"You're going to screw everything up."
"You helped us a lot."
"You didn't say that."
"I can smell it from here."
"And more than once."
"What do I get in exchange?"
"I want him to stay."
"Everything is fine for me."
"Have you discovered something?"
"I'm going to call my father."
"You just made it up."
"I want to do it now."
"He is the boss."
"Nobody ever comes here."
"That wasn't the question."
"Have you seen my mother?"
"Thanks for letting us know."
"It may be related."
"He is in the garden."
"I can't talk to him."
"If you ask me."
"Don't tell Mom anything."
"Do you want to watch the match?"
"Nobody's going to hang you."
"I kiss you too."
"We must make sure of that."
"I want to live my life."
"Ah, so that's it."
"How can you be here?"
"But I'll find out."
"Aren't you introducing us?"
"He threatened my family."
"Are you back already?"
"I was just making conversation."
"For the good of all of us."
"I had two."
"I hired a detective."
"I called your house."
"Peace in the world?"
"I am a good man."
"I let her down."
"I take this seriously."
"Thy will be done."
"I was with someone."
"There are inscriptions."
"I almost believed it."
"I wanted to say thank you."
"So what's your plan?"
"I'm happy for them."
"I have my own business."
"Isn't it almost over?"
"Do you like Italian cuisine?"
"He wanted money."
"He's your little brother."
"I'll talk to him later."
"We should go now."
"Yes, he is with me."
"Everyone relaxes."
"It's everyone's turn."
"You're in my head."
"How many people on board?"
"But in a good way."
"There is a step."
"Look how handsome he is."
"If only it were possible."
"I have to make a call."
"I'll take you to my place."
"That was the good news."
"You, what's your name?"
"I finished my work."
"It's true love."
"I will tell him the truth."
"You're welcome, darling."
"I just wanted to be sure."
"You received orders."
"You'll get another one."
"What do we do in the meantime?"
"I found a solution."
"And when is it?"
"You should see Mr. Leland."
"Are you asking me to marry you?"
"Can I have some bacon?"
"He's good at it."
"I have a new idea."
"They already know."
"Sorry to arrive so late."
"He stopped breathing."
"You're going to want to see this."
"She's in the truck."
"I'm going back to base."
"She opened her eyes."
"Do you have enough to pay?"
"I met a boy."
"Sounds like a plan."
"I want one too."
"I'm taking him home."
"Maybe you too."
"Can we have a minute?"
"Our prayers have been heard."
"It was supposed to be a surprise."
"Would you please shut up?"
"He is at the bank."
"We'll make sure of that."
"They will take care of it."
"Thanks for covering for me."
"This is for my brother."
"I'll pay you later."
"We're going to church."
"Can you give us a second?"
"The Ring is mine."
"We do as usual."
"I've got you, little one."
"I will make a report."
"You need him."
"I give you the choice."
"It looks like a little finger."
"I saw a light."
"She saw something."
"You must obey the rules."
"They never existed."
"Do you want to live with me?"
"No, it's for you."
"Don't think about me."
"Oh, it is."
"Have you changed your hairstyle?"
"I can hear you very well."
"There are priorities."
"I am proud of us."
"I want to do something else."
"In less than an hour."
"Yes, I know that well."
"I've already found it."
"She says hello to you."
"The people love their king."
"No one can see us."
"And I'm grateful for that."
"You have a big heart."
"When did you discover it?"
"It's open to everyone."
"You hadn't stopped?"
"I have something else planned."
"It's been a tough day."
"It's a beautiful gift."
"She was everything to him."
"I went out with him."
"I like them like that."
"Mom told me."
"I've had it up to here."
"What will it be used for?"
"I can guarantee it."
"Will you give me a kiss?"
"She's just a kid."
"No, don't."
"That's another one."
"But who is this guy?"
"He wants it for himself."
"I am a good father."
"He's behind all this."
"You are very late."
"Yes, it was one."
"That's what intimacy is."
"It's all about you."
"All I know."
"She left a message."
"Of course, it's obvious."
"May I say a word?"
"There is a choice."
"Yes, she's right there."
"Thanks, I'll take care of it."
"Doctor, please."
"Would you like to have dinner with me?"
"I don't have them anymore."
"But I feel better."
"Do you think you can do this?"
"You are my best friends."
"Let's see if it suits you."
"I remember that too."
"But yes, it's true."
"You have made a choice."
"You should have known."
"I need protection."
"You are a true genius."
"Because we are friends."
"That's why you're here?"
"A real chatterbox."
"Is everything going as you want?"
"I know, it's incredible."
"I followed orders."
"Can you come for a minute?"
"Not like last time."
"I call it that."
"Isn't that cute?"
"Where do we go from here?"
"Can we have an autograph?"
"It's your last day."
"You're late again."
"I'm in your camp."
"I am open to suggestions."
"Everything you know."
"No, I'm going home."
"Can we talk for a second?"
"He was a wonderful man."
"Do you have anything better to offer?"
"Have you seen enough?"
"It could happen differently."
"It's been a long week."
"Calling all cars."
"That's all they ask for."
"There are cops everywhere."
"I have a new friend."
"You don't want to answer?"
"That's a hell of a lot of money."
"How is your love life going?"
"He has company."
"Issue a wanted poster."
"I still have things to do."
"It was a great evening."
"So I'm going to do it."
"I have known you for a long time."
"I've seen them all."
"You did me a favor."
"I've never done any."
"So why did you do it?"
"He is a good student."
"Because you are you."
"God bless us all."
"Your attention, ladies and gentlemen."
"To be or not to be."
"I'm going to prepare something."
"Don't start with that."
"I'll take you to him."
"That would explain a lot."
"Don't you want to eat?"
"It looks easy."
"Not about that."
"Do you love me a little?"
"Where can we find some?"
"Do I have to do this now?"
"I was just asking a question."
"What am I attracted to?"
"The only thing to do."
"But that's the past."
"It's a big thing."
"It's going to be something."
"I have to find my father."
"I promise you it won't."
"What more is needed?"
"Do you want to get shot?"
"Thank you for being so understanding."
"I have traveled the world."
"Take me to the hospital."
"Take me to a hospital."
"You can stay with us."
"We'll see each other again one day."
"It's for both of us."
"And he found it."
"We'll be right behind you."
"It is a sacred place."
"So where are we?"
"They're coming for me."
"I prayed for you."
"Thank you, I will remember that."
"Well, what are we talking about?"
"It must be for you."
"Who wants pizza?"
"I'm in the bedroom."
"We all have been."
"Pie in the morning?"
"I'm going to make a speech."
"Your mother who loves you."
"You have one."
"Someone needs to be warned."
"Down the street."
"But what are you going to do?"
"I had a wife."
"Yes, it's much better."
"It's her or me."
"Make room for him."
"That's a lot of people."
"Who is this woman?"
"I'm happy for him."
"They went that way."
"It was the right time."
"Can I open my eyes?"
"I'm starting to like it."
"Do you know TV series?"
"You, what are you doing here?"
"It was just to know."
"The city is ours."
"Are you going to do something?"
"I found an apartment."
"Sheltered from what?"
"Does this bring back memories?"
"Several months ago."
"You don't know why?"
"Can I see your license plate?"
"Can I have some ice cream?"
"We must stop them."
"Who is this jerk?"
"I was at the library."
"Yes, I will do that."
"You're driving me crazy."
"I want another opinion."
"Its forests and fields."
"Do you have a better plan?"
"You are a true gentleman."
"The door was wide open."
"Outside the city."
"He is an intelligent man."
"Don't think like that."
"It's just a glass."
"I'm going to go get dressed."
"Does it have to be specific?"
"You're always late."
"Would you like to have dinner with us?"
"Yes, I want to marry you."
"I'll leave you for a moment."
"I got fed up."
"I do it anyway."
"You're a good friend."
"Is that a life?"
"I was your only friend."
"This is a normal reaction."
"I'll take two chickens."
"Yeah, I have to go."
"The calm before the storm."
"Is this a cell phone?"
"What matters?"
"I'm going to get out of here."
"I'll give you the address."
"Is that what you call it?"
"Have you seen my keys?"
"It's better for her."
"That's the big question."
"Take the next right."
"What is your son's name?"
"She's perfect for you."
"And you, do you love him?"
"Tell me about your mother."
"For me or for you?"
"Do you want me to sing?"
"He'll take care of it."
"You never understood."
"It's a beautiful boat."
"This is the last day."
"The car papers."
"I have it somewhere."
"And what are you planning to do?"
"I thought you were joking."
"It really happened."
"I'm going back to school."
"Everyone poops."
"Want to know something else?"
"It's better than before."
"Can you repeat the question?"
"You're a real tough guy."
"Take what you can."
"We can come back later."
"So, a little or a lot?"
"I said my goodbyes."
"Since when is it negotiable?"
"It's a beautiful watch."
"Do you have a copy?"
"I must do my duty."
"This had never happened to me."
"When can I see it?"
"She didn't say."
"I had a stroke."
"We took a detour."
"It is in good condition."
"Watch what you are doing."
"My name is Shawn Spencer."
"I think about it all the time."
"How did you get them?"
"Allow me to withdraw."
"Just a moment, I'll see."
"There is justice."
"It's not practical."
"A big one, is that it?"
"Glad you were there."
"You have a beautiful family."
"More than you can imagine."
"On my father's side."
"Thank you for doing it."
"I know where we're going."
"Who let him in?"
"I never wanted any."
"It's nice of you to call."
"This is my mother-in-law."
"I never could."
"I need an address."
"I'll give you some advice."
"Yes, that's the goal."
"Have you seen them before?"
"Can I go too?"
"My father was like that."
"It's a Spanish name."
"I brought you this."
"And did you like it?"
"You have to remember that."
"How did he get in here?"
"Butch, how do we look for him?"
"I will send you a check."
"He looks charming."
"Look what's happening."
"Can we go somewhere?"
"You heard the chief."
"It looks heavy."
"So far so good."
"I brought you here."
"Are you taking care of that?"
"Yes, it's himself."
"I made an oath."
"Is he nice to you?"
"My feet are cold."
"There was a witness."
"She never existed."
"Not enough for my taste."
"I'll get my device."
"What about blueberry pancakes?"
"It was really something."
"He's a private detective."
"He is a busy man."
"Have a drink with me."
"Well, that's how it is."
"We got along very well."
"I'm new in town."
"Please get out of the car."
"Everyone came."
"I have to eat something."
"And you, where are you?"
"I expected more."
"Give her my regards."
"Want to see the menu?"
"You don't speak English?"
"You came for nothing."
"All that work for nothing."
"No, it can't."
"Will you have everything tomorrow night?"
"Who took this photo?"
"Yes, I feel better."
"I'll bring you a towel."
"You have done your job."
"Don't call the police."
"Not a word to anyone."
"I heard it too."
"Take it as you wish."
"I shit myself."
"I was at university."
"I'm going to the hairdresser."
"But I'm fine now."
"I called my mother."
"You always get away with it."
"What is a pilot?"
"I saw you there."
"Can I call you James?"
"Yes, what is it for?"
"There are two possibilities."
"Isn't it yours?"
"We have half an hour."
"If we have the means."
"Don't close the door."
"Who are our first competitors?"
"Isn't that something?"
"And you, do you love me?"
"Remember to breathe."
"What if I do this?"
"I have made a reservation."
"It was just a shortcut."
"I will cut across the fields."
"And I'll tell you."
"Just tell me the truth."
"Can I ride with you?"
"Thanks for bringing her back."
"Can I see your passport?"
"Please excuse us for a moment."
"Did you hear the news?"
"I am a patient man."
"You have to see something."
"Can you open your eyes?"
"They are our best friends."
"All lines are busy."
"He was a courageous man."
"He is a good son."
"I don't speak German."
"They took everything from us."
"I have to catch my breath."
"It was good work."
"Can you lend us your garage?"
"I saw a girl."
"Do you still have your Malibu?"
"Thank you for this wonderful dinner."
"Nice to see you here."
"But promise me one thing."
"What did you answer him?"
"And we did it."
"It's never good."
"I'm in a band."
"Did you find a topic?"
"There is only one solution."
"Is that his name?"
"You can do that, right?"
"I'm here to work."
"Always the word to make you laugh."
"Why are you so interested in her?"
"I am in perfect health."
"He is in the basement."
"I'm trying to relax."
"Do you want to get rid of it?"
"You are right, of course."
"You scare me."
"You drink more than before."
"Can I see your license?"
"Since when have you been doing this?"
"You don't want to come?"
"He does whatever he wants."
"I'll be there tomorrow morning."
"Please, yes."
"It's fake."
"You are not her."
"I underestimated him."
"So there could be five of them?"
"I wondered why."
"You heard the captain."
"He shot him."
"Do you think the same thing?"
"Catch me if you can."
"Isn't that good?"
"How can she do that?"
"He's a good little guy."
"This is a first draft."
"I'll explain it to you on the way."
"And how are we going to do it?"
"I don't have a father."
"No one can hear you."
"It's the jet lag."
"You shot him."
"He's a cool guy."
"We'll talk again later."
"This time it will be different."
"Did you stay there long?"
"It's an old house."
"I have tons of them."
"Yeah, I did it."
"I'm on the street."
"Go get me a beer."
"You only think about that."
"You keep me informed."
"You didn't like him?"
"Who are you, anyway?"
"We take care of them."
"Let's talk in my office."
"Dad needs us."
"Yeah, you said it."
"Welcome to base camp."
"I'm going to turn off the light."
"I will never see her again."
"But I need it."
"Did you see his eyes?"
"Let me take your bag."
"It is in a safe place."
"Why are you so calm?"
"That's enough, both of you."
"Yes, it is very important."
"Yes, it's over there."
"How was the work?"
"I got this for you."
"Do you know who it was?"
"He came out from behind."
"Why are you sulking?"
"I made two."
"You must leave and quickly."
"You won't get far."
"Do I owe you something?"
"We have to go get her."
"I wrote something."
"I swear I do."
"So what are you talking about?"
"Yes, he is there."
"I'm staying here with you."
"Can't it wait until tomorrow?"
"This is our new home."
"Did you get to see it?"
"What is its origin?"
"We should go together."
"He's still a baby."
"We're doing well, and you?"
"Great kings of Men."
"Yes, most of the time."
"I've never been here."
"You're leaving in an hour."
"Who wants to live forever?"
"He was my grandfather."
"He's in the infirmary."
"He was beside himself."
"And what about that?"
"When did you decide that?"
"Bring him home."
"I know a lot of people."
"I changed the locks."
"We would need a miracle."
"What are you doing with her?"
"Many people do this."
"We should be able to work it out."
"I'm leaving for good."
"I know where she lives."
"One bag, is that okay with you?"
"She was a wonderful woman."
"I'm going to take pictures."
"The road is going to be long."
"As I expected."
"I'm shaking like a leaf."
"I'm going to see the others."
"It's a good lesson."
"Is this a new dress?"
"Have you read my diary?"
"He is abroad."
"It's over, guys."
"I must have lost consciousness."
"It's a side effect."
"They were men once."
"It's all in the mind."
"A wonderful thing has happened."
"He taught me a lot."
"I only see you."
"He is talking to someone."
"I know who it was."
"I'm holding your hand."
"You'll never find her."
"Are you always like this?"
"You come home."
"Things have changed a lot."
"You have gained weight."
"She is capable of anything."
"You're going to wake the baby."
"Have you tried his cell phone?"
"Survival of the fittest."
"It was better than that."
"Of course he can."
"I was trying to protect her."
"What did you give me?"
"No, I'll stay with you."
"We must keep moving forward."
"Where should I start?"
"She's in my bag."
"You have a short memory."
"They won't know anything about it."
"I am his only family."
"Are you going out with Mia tomorrow?"
"Now I don't know."
"Did he have family?"
"No one can hear us."
"Did he come to your house?"
"Do they speak English there?"
"I'm taking the princess to lunch."
"You have to hold on."
"This is my secret garden."
"What is this book about?"
"Have you ever met him?"
"Yes, I have been."
"I think about you a lot."
"The miracle of life."
"It was last month."
"I am your grandmother."
"He was very brave."
"Haven't seen me for six months."
"You have to stop him."
"Do you put whiskey in it?"
"No, where do they come from?"
"Call me whatever you want."
"He is in the tree."
"So, you said 'best intentions'?"
"I just received this."
"I'm going to the pharmacy."
"Who called the cops?"
"Get yourself a real job."
"He got caught."
"Of course, this is normal."
"Give us another chance."
"Maybe it's here."
"I want to be with her."
"What is the dog's name?"
"I need to leave."
"I went to his house."
"My husband left me."
"I'm the victim."
"I had my eyes closed."
"What is this air?"
"I prefer not to answer."
"I'm not normal."
"This place is well protected."
"It means something to me."
"Another day, maybe."
"It's starting to show."
"I already know all that."
"Right next to you."
"I'll give you an example."
"Sorry, those are the orders."
"This is a serious question."
"But who are these guys?"
"This is the desired goal."
"I was just watching."
"He's just a boy."
"Here, it's yours."
"She's there, somewhere."
"What else does he say?"
"Say goodbye to mom."
"I'll go find him."
"This is a generous offer."
"No, it's not nothing."
"He knows where she is."
"And you, where were you?"
"You'll have to follow us."
"She is a good mother."
"I know how to talk to him."
"Were you in the army?"
"We're not breaking up."
"And I found it."
"If I want to."
"It's just an exercise."
"No time to play."
"You heard your mother."
"How many chances do you have?"
"It's a good decision."
"She must not be far away."
"I swallowed the wrong way."
"What am I paying you for?"
"I'll come as soon as possible."
"And that's very good."
"Actually, he's right."
"You have to stay."
"We're going to go there."
"I have to make a decision."
"You need to be more careful."
"Have a cup of tea."
"I'll give you a minute."
"I'll get that for you."
"You have my sympathy."
"It wasn't the right time."
"She is in front of the house."
"Nothing can be proven."
"I needed her."
"She's good at it."
"I want to know something."
"All this is mine."
"They are out of reach."
"And who will make them leave?"
"How am I going to explain this?"
"Can I have a word?"
"You have to do everything yourself."
"I left it there."
"As fast as you can."
"I can't find any."
"You look like an angel."
"I told him to get lost."
"He had that on him."
"Look what I'm doing."
"But it's a good sign."
"Put your head back."
"I conducted my investigation."
"Did he say it?"
"Yeah, I'll do it."
"I can see it now."
"Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson."
"No, I don't dance."
"I'll get a blanket."
"It's a good title."
"Are you taking drugs?"
"Is everything ready for tomorrow?"
"Have a good day at school."
"But it's different now."
"I want to know one thing."
"Who else but them?"
"That's the general idea."
"That's what family is all about."
"Take all available men."
"Are you looking for company?"
"I'll make you an offer."
"All this has already happened."
"We've all been there."
"Don't you feel something?"
"It's an old building."
"You stay in the car."
"I'm on the ground."
"Who is on the case?"
"What have you done?"
"He needs him."
"You have a lot of imagination."
"Who does he work for?"
"Pocket money."
"I already have plans."
"He made me promise."
"Do you want to play with us?"
"Let's start by going down the hill."
"She decides."
"My work here is done."
"I never think about it."
"Is that you, my dear?"
"I thought she was with you."
"Everyone sees it."
"You have to make a good impression."
"From your point of view."
"It never will be."
"This is wonderful news."
"You're right, my dear."
"Very generous of you."
"He's just a baby."
"I do it for her."
"Yes, I have to do it."
"See you at the club."
"Oh, it's for me."
"It has already happened."
"Who would you like to speak to?"
"Did you call my wife?"
"I take care of the children."
"But you just arrived."
"On the way back."
"How far have you got?"
"I'm telling you, man."
"I'm going to the back."
"How do you know so much?"
"He is very lucky."
"It never worked."
"It's meat."
"I'll bring you a coffee."
"Who is entering my domain?"
"Now I'm sure of it."
"Your skin is so soft."
"I need medicine."
"I give you my card."
"But I can't anymore."
"I am near you."
"Did you see the shooter?"
"It's just business."
"The world is full of them."
"What time are you coming home?"
"You can use it."
"I'm resting a little."
"It's a beautiful country."
"He will never forgive me."
"A real bloodbath."
"Do you want to work with me?"
"You are true friends."
"Your oath has been honored."
"It's a big event."
"I'll take care of them."
"As long as we're together."
"There is a body."
"Am I on air?"
"You are a fine blade."
"It's really hot in here."
"She was a strong woman."
"We found his car."
"What's your idea?"
"I don't know, Sergeant."
"Where are we going like this?"
"And you're coming with me."
"Hide under the bed."
"Face the truth."
"We have a new client."
"He's right behind us."
"What is it for you?"
"I went out with her."
"I'm asking you a favor."
"It's thanks to him."
"Let's draw straws."
"It's a bit similar."
"How is it good?"
"I was just asking the question."
"The Community will dissolve."
"You don't look alike."
"Are we going to see a movie?"
"I speak to you as a friend."
"I need the answers."
"Tell me about your life."
"Thank you for talking to us."
"Is this the right road?"
"Of course I knew."
"Nobody wants you."
"And you trust him?"
"There is still hope."
"We have to make a decision."
"I betrayed you all."
"Merry Christmas, everyone."
"No one can know."
"What's your name, kid?"
"I need an assistant."
"It will be worth it."
"See you later, girls."
"Thanks for keeping it."
"I know them by heart."
"He gets paid for it."
"I have a new band."
"Maybe he's sleeping."
"You don't follow them."
"Clothes make the man."
"You have everything going for you."
"But I just arrived."
"The bridge is very close."
"I live in the present."
"That's a challenge."
"I know the whole story."
"I know, it's great."
"I can't find it anymore."
"Stay with me for a while."
"When will he wake up?"
"We're going to have so much fun."
"Let me catch my breath."
"It was important to him."
"You need care."
"I would like to open an account."
"How is your lovely wife?"
"I would be very happy."
"You dare ask me that?"
"I hadn't decided anything."
"If I have time."
"Do what they say."
"I went to the bathroom."
"I went to bed late."
"You better come."
"I was hoping to talk to you."
"It's not a chicken."
"I saw the tape."
"I didn't touch anything."
"Will I see you again one day?"
"She won't wake up."
"We're going to make a deal."
"He came towards me."
"Who is this young girl?"
"You would never do that."
"They're going to have a baby."
"Because I like you."
"Wait for me at the hotel."
"Does this mean anything to you?"
"Thank you for this wonderful evening."
"And that's the end."
"My mind was elsewhere."
"I knew who I was."
"I will give him the message."
"And how do you feel?"
"It's just a picture."
"I'm willing to do it."
"It's a new world."
"Everyone liked him."
"Nothing is ever certain."
"And what about us in all this?"
"Can I get you one?"
"I know where to find some."
"No, that wouldn't work."
"It's always dark here."
"You stay home."
"But hearing is one thing."
"She dreams of tender meat."
"The United States of America."
"It must be for me."
"He's another man."
"This place scares me."
"The force of habit."
"I am the first to be surprised."
"The day has dawned."
"Do you still want me?"
"It's out of control."
"I'll get the newspaper."
"Do me a favor, will you?"
"It's oil."
"He is in his place."
"Would you like to have a drink?"
"I saw them together."
"I have free time."
"I never have any."
"I wanted to go home."
"You're coming to my house."
"Do you still think about her?"
"You have to stay with me."
"I made a cake."
"What did your father say?"
"If that can reassure you."
"I want to be the first."
"It was in my pocket."
"I can read and write."
"It's mine now."
"I took my precautions."
"Do you see it like that?"
"No identity papers."
"Put her in the car."
"He passed by here."
"You are subpoenaed."
"I know how to judge people."
"And they disappear forever."
"Luck is with us."
"I wanted to say goodbye."
"My father and my mother."
"Are you going to eat all that?"
"Do you speak Na'vi?"
"There is an alternative."
"They need rest."
"See you at school."
"Can't we discuss this?"
"Where are you going, buddy?"
"I wanted to get some fresh air."
"I did this to you."
"Is that your advice?"
"Oh, I have an idea."
"You have to let him go."
"Yes, yes, everything is fine."
"Have a nice day to you too."
"You saw a child."
"This is your new home."
"This will all be over soon."
"That's what research is all about."
"And you, in all this?"
"Who did it, then?"
"What should I do about it?"
"I brought the money."
"I want to go there."
"You must tell the truth."
"No one really knows."
"Thanks, but it'll be fine."
"And now you are here."
"I told him yes."
"I would do anything for him."
"Is there a reward?"
"We have good news."
"But who cares?"
"How did he survive?"
"I'd better stay."
"There is a bed."
"I try to be nice."
"Do you think you can get away with it?"
"Have you chosen a name?"
"First thing tomorrow."
"It's on the road."
"You both are."
"Do you have a pass?"
"She went too far."
"That is well said."
"You better speak up."
"How are things between you?"
"Can I have your name?"
"It's the fastest."
"Where is the next bridge?"
"I read your statement."
"No, he doesn't want to."
"It's to defend myself."
"I'm going to dance with her."
"I will never drink again."
"Do we really have to do this?"
"I know everything about him."
"Take me instead."
"I'm taking the next flight."
"This never happened."
"He looks different."
"No one saw us."
"The police will be here soon."
"Put it on speakerphone."
"I find you very beautiful."
"No, there aren't any."
"Give them my regards."
"I need a beer."
"Never heard of them."
"I didn't vote."
"It's English."
"I forgot my book."
"Who made this decision?"
"That's a big word."
"You do it so well."
"She's mine now."
"Can I speak to the chief?"
"It's about money."
"You have made progress."
"What do you call this?"
"Have you ever felt this way?"
"I'm close to the goal."
"Coffee, please."
"He had enough."
"It's just a word."
"We have things in common."
"Tell me who I am."
"You ask me the question?"
"He's out of control."
"I didn't choose it."
"I'm going to do this right."
"I think he knows."
"It's part of you."
"You are his spitting image."
"How can you tell?"
"And you, do you know that?"
"Maybe a little less."
"He sleeps soundly."
"Should I call my lawyer?"
"I do the same thing."
"We still have a chance."
"This is for delivery."
"Where did you buy it?"
"I want to make an exchange."
"No, it will be fine like that."
"Where did you learn this?"
"Do you want to hear a story?"
"I would like to come with you."
"My son is with them."
"She has a date."
"I heard the explosion."
"I want to make things right."
"Come back in half an hour."
"As long as you're fine."
"I'm going to get some cigarettes."
"She's out of control."
"There is a chest."
"I am his best friend."
"It was your father's."
"You need her."
"Whatever she wants."
"Yes, we are aware."
"It will give you a souvenir."
"Are you having a good day?"
"You are not serious."
"Let me see your eyes."
"What she did."
"It's a good hiding place."
"I made a few calls."
"But I'll fix that."
"She is in a good mood."
"Have a drink with us."
"I'll get the file."
"I'm going to see the cops."
"Yes, I have a question."
"What do you mean she's gone?"
"It's different for me."
"He needs air."
"You still have a chance."
"I have a good ear."
"He's mine now."
"They will never find it."
"What does this have to do with my father?"
"Is this for me?"
"Did you have a vision?"
"It's just a book."
"I wish I had one."
"Of course, I knew that."
"And one, two, three, four."
"Did I really do that?"
"I've seen a lot of them."
"How long have you known each other?"
"What is the most important?"
"Everyone stays here."
"Do you want me to come back?"
"But where did he go?"
"This is what we are."
"So you have the money?"
"It was part of the plan."
"And you are part of it."
"He's a smooth talker."
"I was trying to protect him."
"I wanted to give you this."
"Everyone is welcome."
"I'm going to the bank."
"I work all the time."
"They're making fun of me."
"I learned about it yesterday."
"She must be around there."
"I have to go, Dad."
"But it's mine."
"This is going to be headline news."
"I was going to call the police."
"I'll take them later."
"When can we see each other?"
"I have to go relieve myself."
"Put it in my car."
"Sorry we're late."
"Where is the score?"
"You tell yourself stories."
"He is an honest man."
"Come give me a hug."
"It's just an experience."
"I am so grateful to you."
"Ten years is a long time."
"It's a heavy load to carry."
"What are you doing here then?"
"She was just a girl."
"What did you do after?"
"It's easy to find."
"They must be somewhere."
"Have you talked to mom?"
"She's bound to be out there somewhere."
"I already answered you."
"One day after another."
"I took a shortcut."
"But it was a long time ago."
"Can I have some milk?"
"Call me back in an hour."
"It feels so good."
"Ask whoever you want."
"Did she tell you why?"
"I already have a family."
"It is loaded with blanks."
"See you at the station."
"I read it too."
"I had never seen one."
"It looks comfortable."
"We're on the road."
"I'm going to see the children."
"I'll play the game."
"I knew he would come."
"I've always had it."
"But where did she go?"
"Is that the law?"
"It's an interesting choice."
"Do what is right."
"Even if I wanted to."
"You're fine like that."
"You didn't know him."
"What is this painting?"
"Yes, my Precious, very kind."
"And take care of yourself."
"Nor the guidance of missiles."
"Are you thinking about your family?"
"I'll give you the seat."
"It's him or us."
"I'm going to get you treated."
"He is in the subway."
"But I can fix that."
"I got the job."
"Tell me you understand."
"That is, us."
"I love you for that."
"Don't ask me any questions."
"We have a past together."
"I'll get some ice cubes."
"It's up to you to say."
"He took it well."
"It's just work."
"I wanted to show you this."
"They say anything."
"Who's the boss?"
"They didn't come back."
"Yes, it's been a while."
"He's a double agent."
"Tell him who I am."
"Sorry for calling so early."
"So, are you going to do it?"
"But where is he going?"
"I should go see her."
"It's all about timing."
"I want her to stay."
"I want him out."
"Not ours, his."
"You make a lovely couple."
"I am proof of that."
"Yes, thank you for coming."
"She didn't ask for anything."
"I'm just asking a question."
"I can't play."
"They take care of everything."
"My wife did it."
"No, you didn't understand."
"Would you mind talking to me?"
"So what is he doing here?"
"I paid your bail."
"This is a great song."
"His heart no longer beats."
"She has class."
"I am a single mother."
"It's time to intervene."
"I'll send you a car."
"Do you think I'm making this up?"
"Yes, yes, I understood."
"You are the strongest."
"Everyone wants that."
"We're on TV."
"Yes, I'm doing very well."
"I still don't see."
"You only think about yourself."
"I had a drink."
"What is he thinking?"
"I have to get used to it."
"It's starting to take shape."
"It's to protect you."
"So take me with you."
"I wish you long life."
"I owed you one."
"This is what he does."
"When will he be here?"
"I need to see a doctor."
"I was never there."
"No, he has nothing."
"I should go to bed."
"Maybe they'll come back."
"What name did you say?"
"It was taken from me."
"Did he come to see you?"
"Can I go to the toilet?"
"It's a family restaurant."
"I have some good news."
"Don't you want to dance?"
"I play the flute."
"At the end of the month."
"I want to give it to you."
"Everything will be fine for her."
"But maybe so."
"It's from my mother."
"It's happened before."
"The rest is mine."
"Are you together again?"
"We can do something else."
"We are the same person."
"Put everything on my tab."
"He's walking towards you."
"You let her go?"
"What if it happens again?"
"I'm going to go buy some."
"I'll warn the others."
"Yeah, I figured as much."
"I let him in."
"I won my bet."
"What if it's true?"
"You are in perfect health."
"Are you coming to the party?"
"I didn't take them."
"Isn't she awesome?"
"You never say anything."
"It was just a party."
"So, we agree."
"Give it to us, my dear."
"May I know your name?"
"I do anything."
"That must feel good."
"She taught me a lot."
"I like simple things."
"And I like you."
"Do you want to play tough?"
"Luckily I'm here."
"I saw his car."
"I have another suggestion."
"The most powerful of the Nine."
"I felt the wind."
"You have to earn a living."
"I want us to talk."
"Who is your new friend?"
"We have to find a solution."
"If you would be so kind as to sign."
"What were you doing up there?"
"It's starting to be a lot."
"They are somewhere."
"It's going to take forever."
"It's going to be war."
"What do we need?"
"I need a phone."
"What is this book?"
"Where do you get them from?"
"It's okay, sweetie."
"I was just going to say that."
"Let me see your face."
"I hadn't seen it."
"No, she's mine."
"I'll go check that out."
"I forgot the lyrics."
"Do you want more coffee?"
"She was nice to me."
"How long to repair?"
"Are you exercising?"
"Please answer the question."
"You are all welcome."
"He must have his reasons."
"This is definitely a good sign."
"I thought not."
"Wearing it for a while."
"Don't argue with me."
"You weren't expecting me?"
"So, I took it."
"You, me, everyone."
"They know where we are."
"So how is she doing?"
"Goodbye, my old friend."
"Please, man."
"Didn't she tell you anything?"
"I thought it was cute."
"Do you have gas?"
"This is our best option."
"It's in his head."
"This is important work."
"It's going to be all black."
"It's probably better this way."
"They all agree."
"I get to work."
"No news is good news."
"I'm fine, very fine."
"If only it could be true."
"It was an accident, right?"
"I am resourceful."
"It's supposed to be fun."
"What was this circus?"
"We should notify the police."
"Did you let him in?"
"She will never forgive me."
"I live with my parents."
"I'll get the champagne."
"I'm just observing."
"Can I have a minute?"
"But then not at all."
"What are we going to talk about?"
"Did you see it too?"
"You're not helping him."
"He means a lot to me."
"They are old friends."
"I'm taking her with me."
"He's a federal agent."
"I am like the others."
"This place is familiar to me."
"I decided to come back."
"Can I be of use to you?"
"We have to find something."
"I want to watch TV."
"You have to trust him."
"What was school like?"
"There are pictures."
"I am part of you."
"You can be proud of it."
"I am not beautiful."
"Take cover."
"I think I can do it."
"You'll listen to me, right?"
"How long this time?"
"I want to hear your voice."
"I could have done more."
"In the best case scenario."
"I arm all the pieces."
"We take care of our own."
"Everyone knew him."
"Come, I'll show you around."
"I have to talk to him now."
"I know where you are."
"Do you think that's enough?"
"He is trustworthy."
"Yes, but at what cost?"
"Let this stay between us."
"She wants me to leave."
"The design is very old."
"Now he's mine."
"It's starting to get hot."
"Just so you know."
"You're a good father."
"I think about it every day."
"She wouldn't want to."
"Who did you have lunch with?"
"He looks great."
"I have a bunch of them."
"And now, what do we do?"
"Have you seen my daughter?"
"I saw your mother."
"This is a direct order."
"This is the control center."
"I need to eat."
"Oh, that's so cute."
"This time I'll let it go."
"We enter the Vortex."
"So that's why."
"How is your grandmother?"
"He's one of them."
"I tried several times."
"That's what it's called."
"It's a big contract."
"I see a lot of things."
"Do you feel me inside you?"
"She was in the car."
"I want to find my family."
"Are you his girlfriend?"
"Isn't that right, Mr."
"Everyone can cook."
"Haven't you seen her?"
"Everyone believes it."
"Thank you for being my friend."
"I'm working on a case."
"That's life, huh?"
"You should be proud of it."
"You will feel better afterward."
"That's all he does."
"We have a mutual friend."
"Are we going inside?"
"You should go see her."
"Not a minute longer."
"We'll come get you."
"Come over here."
"It won't happen to us."
"Nobody touches anything."
"I'll get some champagne."
"Let them be ready."
"I don't want him."
"Thank you for coming here."
"Everyone knows them."
"It's glue."
"It's really well done."
"I'm leaving right now."
"His alibi holds water."
"Can you give this to him?"
"Did God tell you?"
"Thanks, I have to go."
"It's part of the show."
"Put this in the car."
"I played my part."
"Morning or evening?"
"I'm going that way."
"He got me good."
"I want to see my family."
"You better get some sleep."
"There is a plane."
"He knows it very well."
"It's for business."
"We must turn the page."
"Come on, it's this way."
"I'm thinking of something else."
"Let's go back a little."
"Do you like ice cream, Doc?"
"This one's for me."
"Are you at the hotel?"
"It was to protect you."
"We're on time."
"You have done your part."
"Who is everyone?"
"You know the saddest part?"
"You make me so happy."
"I don't do any."
"I need a plan."
"It looks brand new."
"I love baseball."
"I remember them."
"We have more than that."
"I'll let you go."
"That was the point, right?"
"No, no, it's nothing."
"I love another one."
"You should put on your seatbelt."
"I thought you might like it."
"Yes, we have one."
"Did you come to see me?"
"I got your letter."
"He is a beautiful dog."
"You are more than that."
"It's a bit premature."
"I have to call my father."
"Where will he go?"
"Can I have some tea?"
"A good night's sleep."
"I'm going to the shower."
"We changed our minds."
"That sounds like a good idea."
"I don't want them."
"I love you, old man."
"I didn't learn anything."
"I'll take your coat."
"He is in the morgue."
"He's good somewhere."
"You need to regain your strength."
"You're on the list."
"It's so quiet here."
"Because it's awesome."
"I'll get the other one."
"She has value."
"Nothing beats the present."
"Anyone can enter."
"I just want to see her."
"What is this then?"
"She jumped on me."
"He showed it to me."
"Have you known this for a long time?"
"She is in love with me."
"Yeah, that's not going to happen."
"Do you know where I am?"
"I'll do it on my own."
"Good luck to all of us."
"You have to believe so."
"I am with clients."
"Let me take a look."
"There are several possibilities."
"How do you see it?"
"What was going to happen?"
"I just want some information."
"I'm taking this case off your hands."
"They always have been."
"Where did the money come from?"
"We have all day."
"No, it's too long."
"You had no right."
"How can I find it?"
"You will find another one."
"That's very good."
"I don't play anything."
"What is this voice?"
"Nobody ever says anything to me."
"She likes to eat like this."
"I need action."
"They're after me."
"Nine years ago."
"Is this vodka?"
"But he's your father."
"You started without me."
"Did she say why?"
"You won't know."
"And how is he?"
"And that scares me."
"Talk to your father about it."
"What was the idea?"
"I don't work there anymore."
"It's just a song."
"I didn't dare."
"I drink to your health."
"That's so nicely asked."
"They are coming straight towards us."
"Have you talked to Dad?"
"We'll make him pay."
"A minute ago."
"Thank you for being honest."
"Did you see his look?"
"Do you want to go swimming?"
"He is an excellent doctor."
"Are you blocked or what?"
"I live with my father."
"Where have the people gone?"
"He looks cool."
"How is she doing?"
"Can I have something to drink?"
"This happened to you."
"It's a beautiful view."
"The cops are on their way."
"Was I unconscious for a long time?"
"Anything goes."
"We will take care of him."
"You heard perfectly."
"Return to the starting point."
"Listen, I have an idea."
"I'll leave the door open."
"I want to see the mountains again."
"Tell my father."
"Will you be my wife?"
"I'll stay for a while."
"You heard your father."
"It can last a while."
"He brought me here."
"It's the American dream."
"Your life is at stake."
"Did you enjoy the show?"
"The trail ends here."
"I know them very well."
"I strive to be perfect."
"I already know that."
"I'll fix all this."
"We'll be back in a moment."
"Yes, but you know what?"
"I'll go ask him."
"I love musicals."
"I'll go get some."
"Isn't she charming?"
"This is partly true."
"Because I know him."
"You are in my way."
"What are these people doing here?"
"I always felt it."
"You do this very well."
"I'll bring some water."
"They don't talk to each other."
"No, we have to go."
"He's a man now."
"Glad you stopped by."
"I signed for you."
"We already have one."
"I'm coming from the hospital."
"He is in my class."
"Do you like baseball?"
"That would be wise, my friend."
"It must be fate."
"Someone who loves you."
"I'm made for this."
"I would do the same for you."
"Would you like something?"
"I've had my share."
"No, I'm a better rider."
"She is really very beautiful."
"This will not happen."
"I need support."
"Look, I'll show you."
"Yeah, that's how it is."
"It's his livelihood."
"Did they take something?"
"As long as you want."
"We're going to do something else."
"You're no better."
"No, we just arrived."
"Who's the new guy?"
"Do you have music?"
"I will let him know."
"We all agreed."
"How could I do it?"
"We are in space."
"We have to go somewhere."
"You are a good woman."
"Have you seen this boy?"
"I'm talking into the void."
"A gift from my mother."
"You are hiding something from us."
"I'm doing this for her."
"And now, what do I do?"
"Don't you ever think about it?"
"But I have a family."
"Don't you miss me?"
"I saw the car."
"She's around here."
"I'm broke."
"Open the glove compartment."
"I have friends there."
"That's the idea, yes."
"That's true, actually."
"They didn't think."
"Half a million dollars."
"No, I'm not staying."
"You still have friends."
"I'm going to call a doctor."
"I need the money."
"See you at noon."
"I had you followed."
"Yes, he is mine."
"Yes, I like them."
"It's a great pleasure."
"What if it's him?"
"But there are some."
"Thank you for choosing us."
"I'll find you some."
"This is what you do."
"I really believed it."
"Eight months ago."
"Where are you going so fast?"
"I didn't order this."
"And what does it consist of?"
"But not every day."
"What is this light?"
"We should go to class."
"They just talk."
"You owe me something."
"What's up, girls?"
"See what's happening."
"You must not leave."
"Everyone is different."
"You have to give him credit for that."
"I'll give you my address."
"Thank you all very much."
"She is in the living room."
"It's been half an hour."
"You are better than them."
"I wish you a good trip."
"What is this car?"
"This is my favorite book."
"I have to do it now."
"No, I won't say anything."
"She is an extraordinary woman."
"We must continue to search."
"You're coming with us."
"This is what I see."
"Well, that's very good."
"It's just a test."
"I mean, who knows?"
"I've never taken any."
"Are you done playing?"
"I need care."
"It's the same for us."
"I have something to eat."
"I really did it."
"I have just been warned."
"I would like some water."
"It comes from below."
"It's going to be yours."
"What are you looking for, exactly?"
"You are an amazing woman."
"We are very proud of it."
"I'll take it later."
"I searched on Google."
"We had coffee."
"He can afford it."
"Do you want to go to the movies?"
"Because it's right."
"Thank you for asking the question."
"It's in your nature."
"This is an interesting offer."
"What is your daughter's name?"
"I saw his look."
"No, no, it'll be fine."
"You do it very well."
"He always knew it."
"Every day of my life."
"I heard my name."
"That's good, my dog."
"She gets that from me."
"Did you see a little?"
"Wait, what's this?"
"I should have believed you."
"Can I have his number?"
"The seven CEOs of Tobacco."
"Maybe he is."
"A little more than that."
"My whole life is here."
"I go to the gym."
"You are a pufferfish."
"Father, I beg you."
"We need answers."
"Women and children?"
"I visited him."
"You don't answer me."
"Where is my camera?"
"What do you have against me?"
"Do you want to turn around?"
"You are a woman now."
"Now we can go."
"What is this costume?"
"How can you eat that?"
"Is it raining?"
"It's a fixed idea."
"You're not even trying."
"He is in Los Angeles."
"And yes, I want to play."
"Family is important."
"I'm going to the morgue."
"I work at the hospital."
"I can't pay."
"She got you good."
"I'm in the middle of a conversation."
"Isn't he charming?"
"We're having a boy."
"I learned like that."
"Have you seen my brother?"
"You did your part."
"Of course, who else?"
"I'll send you a photo."
"I make them myself."
"He shits his pants."
"I have never played."
"And that's it, it's over."
"Are you going to stay with me?"
"Who else lives here?"
"Is he the Worm?"
"He rolls the ship."
"It's just a fact."
"It's an old map."
"You are cleared for takeoff."
"And what did it give?"
"I know how it's done."
"And I met you."
"That's business."
"I was on the island."
"It's my home too."
"This is an incredible opportunity."
"It's much easier."
"Can I have more?"
"What school do you go to?"
"Only you remain."
"He has a future."
"I'm going to the bedroom."
"Isn't that cool?"
"All men are."
"Where is this dress from?"
"There's also that."
"I don't read them."
"You'll feel better."
"I have to say no."
"I spoke with him."
"I ask you nicely."
"You like him, don't you?"
"You don't see her?"
"Your secret will be well kept."
"Yes, you can go."
"And that doesn't bother you?"
"There is the kitchen."
"Can I speak frankly to you?"
"You have to leave the city."
"We are in front of the entrance."
"Did he say his name?"
"Maybe it was me."
"I saw your face."
"Where did the money go?"
"Do you have any other ideas?"
"I'm in the garage."
"Did you do the job?"
"You could have said so."
"The big moment has arrived."
"It was your mother's."
"And now what do I do?"
"I can't leave her."
"I am a housewife."
"It is a proven fact."
"It's a beautiful costume."
"Where is the other car?"
"We can say that, yes."
"Four months ago."
"I didn't wake up."
"I am a cleaning lady."
"It's so beautiful here."
"Put it in your pocket."
"You call this love?"
"I imagined you to be taller."
"But we did it."
"What if we went there?"
"Did you take any pictures?"
"The door opened."
"It's heroin."
"The trees will come back to live here."
"Aren't you exaggerating a little?"
"Your father wants to talk to you."
"He was in love with me."
"I've already called them."
"Not even by their mother."
"That's kind of true."
"What will people think?"
"It's natural selection."
"You forgot a place."
"Who are you supposed to be?"
"Tell them to hurry up."
"Everyone is there."
"We can do both."
"Where can I find you?"
"Sorry, what did you say?"
"They are all so beautiful."
"What did you want to show me?"
"It's a dressy evening."
"Who wouldn't want that?"
"All right, that's settled."
"You must make an appointment."
"On the contrary, it's perfect."
"What else do you do?"
"Do you have any experience?"
"He is a lucky man."
"Do you believe in reincarnation?"
"Where do you get that from?"
"Are you going to take care of it?"
"I am a good citizen."
"There were plenty of them."
"I just received it."
"I owe him an apology."
"You are not God."
"What is this movie?"
"Do you live near here?"
"We will know more tomorrow."
"Tell us where you are."
"No, I have an appointment."
"I want you to look."
"Is this your first visit?"
"Yeah, I saw that."
"What is it made of?"
"Maybe more than that."
"It will be better tomorrow morning."
"Maybe we're there."
"Are we going up or down?"
"Beyond, another dimension."
"This is the case now."
"The whole town knows it."
"Did you enjoy yourself?"
"The man in the street."
"I understand you very well."
"I signed the papers."
"It is a registered trademark."
"Home to amazing things."
"There is one thing you should know."
"It's true, I know."
"Have you lived here long?"
"What do we owe the honor?"
"This is my favorite dish."
"That's reason enough."
"She never will be."
"I just want to protect you."
"But yes, you know it."
"Give me your news."
"Give me some news."
"I saw the file."
"That's what friendship is."
"On the ground, face down."
"Listen to me for once."
"You passed the test."
"We'll talk about it again tonight."
"Do you remember it now?"
"Who is this pretty girl?"
"You don't do them."
"How much did you drink?"
"I've often thought about it."
"You better back off."
"Can you say the same?"
"Have you never been there?"
"I voted for him."
"Since always and forever."
"But who did this?"
"We are good people."
"I've always been here."
"They are in the car."
"It was his first time."
"We can still do it."
"I have gold."
"I'll bring you some tea."
"What was the honor?"
"I join you."
"What is this language?"
"The man I was looking for."
"Can I use the phone?"
"I'll get a vase."
"That's all, guys."
"I just made some."
"May God be with us."
"The fishing was good."
"I have to put an end to this."
"I haven't even started."
"You look very beautiful."
"I took action."
"There was a word."
"She takes care of me."
"I made a deal."
"Good to see you, man."
"I know how you are."
"I heard your voice."
"We'll have to go."
"This is our greatest asset."
"She was a beautiful woman."
"I want to see you smile again."
"Have you been drinking or something?"
"It's D-day."
"I understood something."
"I need to change."
"Some time ago."
"I have to go shopping."
"I'm going to sell the house."
"I will write it to you."
"Do you want to go to bed?"
"I witnessed it."
"It's just a tip."
"A day like any other."
"I like this guy."
"You know, he's right."
"It comes from within."
"Not if we stay loyal."
"You look busy."
"It's really very pretty."
"I need the keys."
"We have men everywhere."
"The craftsmanship is excellent."
"What are you doing later?"
"It's time to play."
"She is in good health."
"I want to go out with you."
"She's coming to see you."
"Would you like to take a tour?"
"The meal is almost ready."
"I want to stay with him."
"I am a secret agent."
"I was being funny."
"Maybe you should have."
"Do you have any food?"
"And what do we have here?"
"This is my favorite moment."
"Or whatever."
"I have to see the doctor."
"I didn't accept."
"I drank a little."
"He's the spitting image of you."
"Don't answer that."
"She has a lot of talent."
"And at that time?"
"I think they're coming."
"I served my country."
"They had other plans."
"I needed him."
"I thought she was asleep."
"I am the rightful king."
"Have you spoken to him about it?"
"She won't be there."
"Tell your friends."
"The voices of our ancestors."
"When did you arrive here?"
"What could he have done?"
"Look what she's doing."
"I packed my bags."
"But it could be."
"I want to see your eyes."
"I know how he is."
"It was my first mission."
"But it's very good."
"I hope you will come."
"This money is mine."
"It lasted for a while."
"What's new for you?"
"Sorry for waking you up."
"Who can do something?"
"Do your parents know?"
"I'm going to get some candles."
"We have to go that way."
"The Ring has awakened."
"So you have a choice."
"Do you know where I'm going?"
"Where can I reach him?"
"We should all do it."
"Well, where were we?"
"I have it online."
"That must mean no."
"We'll see you tomorrow morning."
"Do you want to stay with me?"
"I saw you taller."
"Everyone is hungry."
"She looked good."
"He's here somewhere."
"We are a good team."
"Just a little further."
"I have been watching you for a long time."
"It will change your life."
"No ID."
"But what is the connection?"
"It just works."
"A work of art, truly."
"Go ahead for me."
"You don't talk to each other?"
"We'll talk about that tomorrow."
"I'll pour us a drink."
"Good luck, everyone."
"Compliments of the chef."
"I don't know anything else."
"But we can fix that."
"She has a sense of humor."
"What's in your eyes?"
"One day and one night."
"I can't choose."
"It costs money."
"It's a good mobile."
"I would do it myself."
"I'm going back to the hotel."
"Where did you take him?"
"This is witchcraft."
"I have to call my wife."
"I found it there."
"What exactly are you doing?"
"It's a beautiful room."
"Take him back to his cell."
"It makes me so happy."
"Both at the same time."
"Pretty much."
"Can I borrow your phone?"
"I would have liked to meet her."
"I am an honest man."
"She is the most beautiful."
"You are always with me."
"You never called."
"There is the account."
"The village gets up early."
"It's politeness."
"Her maiden name?"
"Oh, of course I do."
"Above your head."
"This is what I was waiting for."
"I will take his place."
"They took it from me."
"Who tells you otherwise?"
"I earn a good living."
"Welcome to your new body."
"Someone to talk to."
"The past is behind us."
"The others, come with me."
"How does this affect you?"
"They don't speak English."
"Where is the rebel base?"
"No firearms."
"He looks harmless."
"Can we do this now?"
"I have another surprise."
"Now it's our turn."
"Is she dating someone?"
"As you requested."
"Put this in your ear."
"What if we are seen?"
"You move forward."
"Up the hill."
"Everyone stops."
"I need a bag."
"What happens to them?"
"Not because of you."
"What if they do?"
"What do I do with him?"
"He is really very good."
"It sounds romantic."
"I taught him that."
"Are you coming or are you staying?"
"Was he your boyfriend?"
"I think I do too."
"You should go rest."
"Shall we put on some music?"
"I come from the street."
"I can't go anywhere."
"What are you playing at?"
"Did I say otherwise?"
"I'm ready to talk."
"Tomorrow we get up early."
"Do you want her to come?"
"Here, please."
"I got fucked."
"I've been thinking about it for a long time."
"It makes him feel good."
"You remind me of your father."
"They are in the back."
"Do I have to sign something?"
"So, did you like it?"
"What did the doctors say?"
"She needed money."
"He's just a man."
"No, it's my turn."
"Are you inviting me to dinner?"
"Thank you for replacing me."
"You are in my place."
"He was with a girl."
"He comes from the right."
"Because you love it."
"I opened my eyes."
"Someone has to stay here."
"You look great together."
"Can you get me a drink?"
"Would you excuse us for a minute?"
"They make a beautiful couple."
"She will never know."
"Reason about what?"
"I've had it forever."
"You don't work here anymore."
"Pour me another one."
"How pregnant are you?"
"I called a taxi."
"Do we have to do this now?"
"You're safe now."
"You don't recognize me anymore?"
"Do you think she knows?"
"This is my favorite drink."
"Where were you raised?"
"He was one of us."
"Did she say all that?"
"It is an established fact."
"He looks better."
"Thanks for last night."
"Can you come for a moment?"
"You have a nice garden."
"What color are they?"
"It was a beautiful speech."
"You know."
"I found it here."
"This is a new model."
"You look fantastic."
"How is that fair?"
"Meat on wheels."
"It's in my bag."
"Why did you come then?"
"What is your friend's name?"
"But my decision is made."
"I understood one thing."
"I need a room."
"I went for a walk."
"Is this a real question?"
"I'm going to make a toast."
"He is with us now."
"How did you get out of it?"
"She is in intensive care."
"You need a lawyer."
"Did you find anything else?"
"Bachelor party."
"Do you want to see his picture?"
"Where can I find them?"
"It's in three days."
"I am not homosexual."
"You heard the gentleman."
"This is a huge opportunity."
"There was a reason."
"Because he is."
"Sit on my throne."
"Another one did it."
"As if you knew."
"I was hoping to find you here."
"I don't speak Russian."
"I forgot the number."
"Where did you see her?"
"You have until tomorrow."
"I am sane."
"She was no longer there."
"I will always be your friend."
"I will be grateful to you."
"Who said anything about money?"
"He was a good agent."
"In that case, good night."
"I'm one of the good guys."
"I'm going to take the subway."
"You must be very busy."
"No one saw him again."
"He should be fine."
"I have some on me."
"Don't let him down."
"I have never danced."
"No, I don't have."
"We saw each other yesterday."
"Isn't it good?"
"If you have time."
"Dad, did you see that?"
"I would really like to know."
"Remember who you are."
"Who wants to take his place?"
"It's not a word."
"Can you turn off the light?"
"She's on the plane."
"I'm starting to like him."
"And what do you plan to do?"
"It's for a few days."
"He was a human being."
"I made some changes."
"They will never find us."
"I have a good teacher."
"It's for something else."
"Hide under the stairs."
"But that's something else."
"I almost forgot it."
"You have to meet her, Kara."
"I arrived this morning."
"I am open to everything."
"No, it's my idea."
"His gaze was caught."
"You don't listen to the radio?"
"Can we leave here?"
"I know how to manage on my own."
"Of course not."
"You're just a kid."
"Let's postpone this."
"Have you told me everything?"
"Just like in real life."
"His life is at stake."
"You should have stayed there."
"Believe me, it's true."
"He takes care of me."
"There is trouble."
"So you're going to do it?"
"But you can do it."
"Yes, it feels good."
"Yes, I'll get her."
"You are better than me."
"A family member."
"I saw his mother."
"Everyone wants it."
"It has to lead somewhere."
"What do you plan to do with it?"
"Family comes first."
"She would do anything for you."
"I explained everything to him."
"It could take days."
"I should have said it."
"And it is very powerful."
"I wrote a poem."
"We got rid of it."
"He let me go."
"We got spotted."
"I have it in my sights."
"I am part of the scenery."
"I have friends here."
"I did the calculations."
"No, no, it's good."
"I am the same person."
"How did they get it?"
"But where is the world going?"
"Thank you, it's very beautiful."
"The cops got him."
"It was the right choice."
"Tell him anything."
"What I had to do."
"I'll have to leave you."
"I need sugar."
"It's just words."
"No, we shouldn't."
"That is, you."
"The witness has rights."
"I have to stop him."
"You have to live your life."
"He has personality."
"But you have to believe me."
"Should I draw you a picture?"
"The world is really small."
"We met yesterday."
"So, did you find it?"
"Can I touch your hair?"
"I forgot my text."
"I see light."
"No, you have to listen to me."
"How many did you eat?"
"This is my point of view."
"Can this stay between us?"
"Because he loves you."
"And I have you."
"This is pure genius."
"I hear him coming."
"And there we go."
"Maybe it's time."
"Thank you for following us."
"Did you just find out?"
"Who's the boss here?"
"How did you find out about this?"
"He has special powers."
"The chance of a lifetime."
"It is a peaceful demonstration."
"It was just a joke."
"Do you want to listen to the radio?"
"I was hoping for double that."
"They took the little ones."
"It's sunny."
"Two sugars, right?"
"That's it, very good."
"She runs the Avatar program."
"I'm going to do some shopping."
"Just the way I like it."
"You should call the police."
"I repeat, do you hear me?"
"And they will trust me."
"Yes, you have one."
"No, he just left."
"No one tells me anything."
"It's on your desk."
"You have until midnight."
"Am I free to go?"
"I always tell the truth."
"Welcome to the White House."
"Have you had your fill?"
"I must be getting old."
"But you will recover."
"Why do you want to go there?"
"It's very well done."
"I'm sure of that."
"I let her do it."
"See you on the track."
"I have to find something."
"I saw a picture."
"Yes, that's the word."
"I have a better plan."
"I beg you, Tony."
"Find out who did this."
"That's the dream."
"Tell them they're coming."
"I have other clients."
"I'll take care of the luggage."
"You are beautiful and intelligent."
"Do you remember the Shire?"
"What is this box?"
"So don't tell him anything."
"Put it on my account."
"He has class."
"Ah, you don't know."
"It's true, you know."
"Are you guys hungry?"
"Let's say you're right."
"I'm on time."
"Would you please concentrate?"
"It's going pretty well."
"I waited for hours."
"Okay, I have an idea."
"A decision had to be made."
"You were in my dream."
"Shall I draw you a picture?"
"How was your weekend?"
"I work with my father."
"It went well."
"She never listens to me."
"Thank you, that means a lot to me."
"What kind of car is it?"
"We've seen enough."
"You were never born."
"Can I see the room?"
"We'll talk about it tonight."
"It's a friendly visit."
"I blamed myself."
"It makes your eyes pop."
"The Ring is yours."
"Everyone except you."
"Same as here."
"You must go."
"She didn't know anything about it."
"Your place is with Victor."
"Oh, how sweet."
"This is serious business."
"Let's talk about the black bird."
"I know and I appreciate it."
"As you will see."
"Do you want to take a bath?"
"Did you see him leave?"
"It's between the two of you."
"You should take care of it."
"I'm not leaving without him."
"Let's go take a look."
"I know, that's a lot."
"This is a good catch."
"It was in an airport."
"Because, that's all."
"But what are you thinking?"
"And you, what would you do?"
"Fine, I'll take care of it."
"I've been waiting for an hour."
"Do you think he knows?"
"I saw the Earth."
"I want you to go out."
"I grew up in Texas."
"I need guarantees."
"Have you seen her recently?"
"No, they're coming to get me."
"Yes, it can be done."
"I have another theory."
"I thought I had seen it all."
"You won't tell me anything?"
"I have to go, sorry."
"Do you want me to come down?"
"You have an idea."
"We are far from everything."
"I risked my life."
"My car is over there."
"Do you want to hear the monkey?"
"Do you want to see a movie?"
"Not a breath of wind."
"Go take care of that."
"I'm not a kid anymore."
"You're in a good mood."
"No secrets between us."
"I heard that too."
"I'm not a victim."
"I have to prepare dinner."
"What do you think, darling?"
"I came to talk business."
"I'm leaving in a week."
"It's been a year already."
"Norm changed his attitude."
"Does the police know?"
"I don't know, Master."
"It's in his file."
"Do you want to do this now?"
"I need a reason."
"Shall we have a game?"
"I haven't planned anything."
"Okay, you got me."
"Can I see his room?"
"I am not Japanese."
"You better make sure."
"Thanks for bringing it."
"I'm just going to talk to him."
"It has sentimental value."
"To teach him a lesson."
"He helped me a lot."
"Get to work, everyone."
"So I'll go."
"As if it was going to happen."
"How can you talk like that?"
"He wants to see you now."
"I have hope."
"Let me open the door."
"Who could you be?"
"I knew this would happen."
"It's on time."
"Did I win something?"
"She will never love you."
"She was my little girl."
"Rider of the Last Shadow."
"But now it's over."
"He is in the hall."
"We were supposed to go together."
"What's the topic?"
"When can I see her?"
"I just left him."
"I didn't get it."
"I like that about you."
"I just added it."
"Well, he's right."
"And we found each other."
"Could I have your attention?"
"He had it with him."
"Actually, it's perfect."
"Captain's log."
"Tap water."
"Do you like making love?"
"This man is an imposter."
"I needed to know."
"What is this one?"
"I'm almost out of it."
"It's his birthday tomorrow."
"Look through my eyes."
"I'm going to bed now."
"Do you want to go to the bathroom?"
"This is our last hope."
"I will be on the bridge."
"Can we have some coffee?"
"I had to tell him."
"I think he's coming."
"Go ahead on my behalf."
"As far as I know, yes."
"I left my wife."
"This is very, very important."
"Do you have a better one?"
"Yes, you are probably right."
"These are organic crops."
"Who is the commanding officer?"
"I'll take care of it tomorrow."
"Can I see your card?"
"No one else but me."
"I would do anything for her."
"People are like that."
"I don't trust anymore."
"What should I have said?"
"I'll explain to you one day."
"I spoke to the doctor."
"You have to go get him."
"She was my whole life."
"So many things can happen."
"No, I bought it."
"Wait, I'll show you."
"Did you take your painkiller?"
"Of course, if you want."
"And that I love you."
"You wanted to see me, boss?"
"You're going to wake the children up."
"Who is the strongest?"
"I took advantage of you."
"But I know the truth."
"I'll put you through to the president."
"But I'm telling you."
"I was in a daze."
"It is important to me."
"I take the first plane."
"Make me a copy."
"He works all the time."
"Take care of the girl."
"I am a just man."
"There is an address."
"Yes, but it's different."
"Just go ahead."
"I come for the monkeys."
"It's a natural reaction."
"Hi, Mom, it's me."
"You live in the past."
"She doesn't talk to anyone."
"The car is over there."
"Not much to see."
"I want you with me."
"It's my hobby."
"Before everything happened."
"I'll give you my card."
"You are a good commander."
"But yes, I love you."
"You think you're at home."
"You didn't dare."
"They are here for you."
"We have to take care of it."
"My life is at stake."
"The address is within reach."
"It's almost your birthday."
"And she chose you."
"You asked me, Colonel?"
"Because I want to know."
"No, he isn't."
"I had an abortion."
"Can't you pay attention?"
"Your word against mine."
"I have an important question."
"It can be useful to us."
"Can I borrow your cell phone?"
"You'll pay me later."
"I'm going to tell the truth."
"You must not wait."
"This is my little secret."
"Go ahead, call the police."
"Are you still looking for stories?"
"But that will never happen."
"Put it on my tab."
"What's changing?"
"I heard an explosion."
"No, everything is fine."
"Is that your secret?"
"Are you in the area?"
"He's a good agent."
"Were you going to say something?"
"The Lord is this mountain."
"He's a good horse."
"There are complications."
"I wrote a book."
"You never talked about it."
"What if I said no?"
"Everything is fine, it's fine."
"Aren't you changing?"
"But he's my friend."
"I'll give you the money."
"I read an article."
"At my place or yours?"
"They did their reconstruction."
"We are in the street."
"This applies to everyone."
"I got a tip."
"I just wanted to say it."
"Everything else depends on it."
"I chose to stay."
"I want to tell the truth."
"I'll take both."
"Do you do gymnastics?"
"I promise you one thing."
"This is no longer true."
"She's a little shaken."
"Things and others."
"Do you think I'm bluffing?"
"Even if it's true."
"This is the main focus."
"You better succeed."
"Who raised the alarm?"
"Light, please."
"Do you want to get caught?"
"It's a coded message."
"Nobody wants to believe me."
"I followed my instinct."
"The captain wants to see you."
"You go first."
"You must go home."
"He thought of everything."
"What is it, anyway?"
"Do you know where they are going?"
"I thought it would work."
"Everyone was happy."
"You have a lot of nerve."
"I will pass the message on."
"I have hundreds of them."
"I want to start from scratch."
"She will be back soon."
"It's a real fortress."
"Thank him for me."
"It's a little gift."
"Glad you're home."
"What is left for us?"
"What's your name, son?"
"She didn't come out."
"You have to do this right."
"I need a pick-me-up."
"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys."
"She left her phone."
"You should see your face."
"The color of his eyes?"
"Come see me tonight."
"You will hear from us."
"I could do without it."
"You need a mandate."
"What are you doing with him?"
"You cut your hair."
"We must tell the truth."
"And he was on sedatives?"
"It seemed so."
"He is in a good mood."
"We were shot at."
"On the top shelf."
"Have you seen James Cole?"
"They hide them up there."
"Do you want to see this one?"
"But not as much as you."
"Haven't you had enough?"
"This is another reason."
"And the pay is good."
"Time stood still."
"He got you good."
"Got you, huh?"
"My father did it."
"I'm doing very well, thank you."
"I forgot my gloves."
"When will you introduce her to me?"
"I cooked dinner."
"Others will come from Heaven."
"I will rise to the occasion."
"You don't take any?"
"Tell him to hurry."
"It's up to you to cross it."
"Have you never done it?"
"I bought a house."
"Are you taking care of yourself?"
"No, it's just me."
"He is with a patient."
"I heard some stuff."
"It's just a cut."
"I will find money."
"You're going to take that plane."
"Do you want honesty?"
"Do you know who's in charge here?"
"Are you coming from the city?"
"Smile, please."
"No, you don't know anything."
"Have you seen this sign?"
"There is a baby."
"The woman of your life?"
"I made love."
"How can this be possible?"
"You should have told him."
"That's good for that."
"I will do it as soon as possible."
"I almost got it."
"You didn't leave?"
"Tell me more about Jeffrey."
"I'm here if needed."
"I am a security guard."
"You are a wise man."
"He has resources."
"Did he ask you?"
"It's a video game."
"Do you have any on you?"
"There is a price."
"They threatened my family."
"I heard the call."
"Do you have it with you?"
"Yes, it is a possibility."
"Everything seems to be in order."
"They are at school."
"I'm going to turn around."
"We must keep the faith."
"Your father is waiting for you there."
"And for how long?"
"Tell me about your husband."
"The law of the jungle."
"I should go see him."
"Nothing but water."
"I want half of it."
"No, I can't take it anymore."
"I thought I knew you."
"No one should see it."
"Identification, please."
"Give mom a kiss."
"She was full of life."
"No, he's my brother."
"I will do anything for you."
"It's hot in there."
"I just want to thank you."
"He is as he is."
"Dad, what is this?"
"Do you want to get some fresh air?"
"You must understand one thing."
"She is retired."
"You never talk about it."
"She is in the house."
"I'm going to load the car."
"It has always belonged to you."
"What was it like there?"
"This is his modus operandi."
"What was it this time?"
"You were very clear."
"Was the hunt good?"
"It was all cooked."
"I don't touch you."
"Maybe it was him."
"He's a good teacher."
"No one says otherwise."
"This is a talking movie."
"No, he won't come."
"Well, that's a start."
"He is on the beach."
"I'll make you a list."
"Maybe it will work."
"I'm going to speak to you frankly."
"It's full of vitamins."
"Do you know how we do it?"
"You are a good soldier."
"Let's follow these traces of paint."
"And I took it."
"This is your avatar now."
"Your father would have been proud."
"You have always been strong."
"It wasn't mean."
"No, I'll be fine, thanks."
"He knows where you are."
"You must know that well."
"I like to see the sun."
"I won the bet."
"I didn't ask him anything."
"How can you believe it?"
"He always gets away with it."
"Since when have they been doing this?"
"I brought mine."
"I'll give it back to you tomorrow."
"He has a long arm."
"You are a good police officer."
"I came back for this."
"I thank God for that."
"We do our best."
"And what do I tell them?"
"I played the game."
"No, I'll stay here."
"Were you in love with her?"
"I would like to have your opinion."
"Guess what I have."
"He is a powerful foreigner."
"Everyone said it."
"Glad you called."
"The boss wants to talk to you."
"Are we going to the bedroom?"
"I like doing that."
"That's cool for you."
"I want to find my son."
"I have to tell you about it."
"They are from the police."
"I think of my mother."
"He is involved in politics."
"Let's do it your way."
"We are in the right place."
"Yes, everything is in order."
"They got your message."
"Have fun, kids."
"I almost fainted."
"It's a good product."
"Let me prove it to you."
"Did you party?"
"She might have gone out."
"He is the most qualified."
"Everyone takes it."
"Will it take much longer?"
"She won't do that."
"I brought her to you."
"Your place is with us."
"Why are you so interested in this?"
"I already know the answer."
"But where do you come from?"
"What I always do."
"He may be telling the truth."
"Go get another one."
"This is a good lead."
"Now's his chance."
"No one is stopping you."
"And there, what do you see?"
"I want this to end."
"Any news about my daughter?"
"This is my new friend."
"He is a good lawyer."
"Think carefully before you answer."
"What was your head at?"
"He was born like that."
"Did you hear that, guys?"
"Analysis is in progress."
"Are you in the cinema?"
"I think she's asleep."
"You are my big brother."
"I will bring you something to eat."
"This is for your mother."
"That's the reality."
"Can you promise me?"
"Here is my business card."
"This is the last step."
"I want the same thing."
"I can tell you everything."
"He comes every day."
"It always starts like this."
"It's just a costume."
"He asked for a lawyer."
"Who are the other candidates?"
"You already know the answer."
"You should have seen me."
"Have you seen my husband?"
"Do you want to tell me about it?"
"I'll try the number."
"I'm getting married soon."
"I'll take the first quarter."
"In a retirement home."
"That's good news."
"Why are you making a face?"
"Let me introduce you to my mother."
"No, I don't hear anything."
"Ahead of his time."
"She told us."
"I know him a little."
"He's that big."
"This is an important topic."
"You are here with me."
"Don't sleep with him."
"Can you tell me about it?"
"It took years."
"I need to speak to the commander."
"I didn't take any."
"It's in a month."
"Do you want to go out with her?"
"Yes, I believe in God."
"What will they say about him?"
"I love you, my angel."
"Not so small."
"They are attracted to him."
"I called your office."
"I taught myself."
"And what is the answer?"
"But we can talk, right?"
"She is part of me."
"We have a good team."
"Now I have to go."
"I should never have."
"It was a great match."
"You're talking about a brother."
"What was her name again?"
"But I want to do it."
"I must say goodbye now."
"It's a new life."
"You hadn't noticed?"
"Nobody knows who you are."
"She can't do anything."
"Is everyone served?"
"You have to go that way."
"We have to go to Florida."
"There is glass."
"It's a big family."
"It could take years."
"It changes all the time."
"We received orders."
"I apologize for that."
"We just received it."
"I expect anything."
"How do you want to play it?"
"Otherwise, it will be the stick."
"There is a queue."
"She needs water."
"That was my first impression."
"Can you give it back to them?"
"I want to have children."
"Who did all this?"
"No one will know the difference."
"I really saw it."
"Is this your last word?"
"Is this from?"
"But it's my life."
"Did he let you go?"
"They are not ordinary."
"How many languages do you speak?"
"How much will it cost us?"
"Have you seen this dog?"
"Please do."
"What is it, Captain?"
"Yes, I called him."
"You're one of us."
"I'll take you with me."
"I will wait with you."
"I read your article."
"Have we seen each other before?"
"They are heading towards us."
"I will trust you."
"I mean, look at you."
"And you, what do you think?"
"What I have to do."
"They know we're coming."
"Yes, I read them."
"Yes, I saw you."
"I can't stop anything."
"Maybe I should try."
"Because you are good."
"Have you found the commander?"
"The car is downstairs."
"Do you remember Ross?"
"I have to go talk to him."
"It's a nice hotel."
"Fourteen years ago."
"Glad you're feeling better."
"Thank God you were there."
"I have a feeling about it."
"You need a wife."
"I have the right, right?"
"It's not there."
"Thank you for bringing me."
"Everyone must participate."
"I asked myself that."
"Who wants to eat cereal?"
"Isn't he perfect?"
"Not at the moment, no."
"I should come with you."
"He was a good kid."
"Communication with the outside world?"
"I have two left."
"I have to go, okay?"
"It's for show."
"Take back what belongs to us."
"There was a child."
"When are you going to tell him?"
"Did I say it right?"
"Did you bring her here?"
"I had already seen it."
"This is your new partner."
"It's just a guess."
"I'm going to take the train."
"Where should I send it?"
"We have common interests."
"And many other things."
"She's waiting in the car."
"Baltimore County Hospital."
"Are you closing the door?"
"I'm in the place."
"Oh, I'll take care of it."
"And what are you?"
"I'm here to pick up some things."
"Afterwards, we'll leave."
"This is just an example."
"What are you doing down there?"
"My sister liked it."
"Two bullets in the chest."
"Is it to your liking?"
"Are you here on business?"
"How did they do that?"
"I sold the house."
"Did you call home?"
"I'm doing well and you?"
"His words, not mine."
"Tell me just one thing."
"Wait for me in my office."
"You're not the boss."
"What else can I tell you?"
"I'm a good shot."
"All to battle stations."
"Things are different here."
"You should go now."
"How dare you challenge me?"
"What do I do in the meantime?"
"You dare do this to me?"
"It's on the map."
"But I have to go back."
"I have to find my family."
"It's in my car."
"I went to bed early."
"But I still love him."
"I was on the verge."
"How about we have a drink?"
"She can't hear me."
"I thought you understood."
"There is a bucket."
"You are an excellent observer."
"Oh, yes, that's it."
"What are you apologizing for?"
"Right in the face."
"How would you have known?"
"I'll get a drink."
"It comes from outside."
"Say something nice."
"Come on, we can do it."
"Do you know where I was?"
"He is a young man."
"She didn't love me."
"And what do I have?"
"Are you going to a funeral?"
"Sounds fascinating."
"Don't you recognize me?"
"I was expecting you earlier."
"Did you receive my gift?"
"There is a surprise."
"I need it too."
"No need to scream."
"This is the White House."
"I brought flowers."
"What is the correct answer?"
"You'll tell me later."
"It's perfect for us."
"What was that story?"
"I should be with them."
"Who's in on it?"
"You are a remarkable woman."
"You wanted to see me, Commander?"
"It's for our own good."
"It was a good start."
"You knew I would come."
"I think of you often."
"Someone is taking care of it."
"Can we watch TV?"
"He needs to talk."
"Nick, please."
"No, stay where you are."
"I already have a father."
"I have to take a picture."
"I did the cleaning."
"We will do as you wish."
"You and who else?"
"That's a bit tight."
"Anyone home?"
"Our paths separate here."
"Why don't you come to my house?"
"I was just waiting for that."
"Are you going to just stand there?"
"Don't slam the door."
"I'm going to leave here."
"So, can I go?"
"Look at those two."
"Of course it works."
"He's a good actor."
"No, I'm not giving up."
"Are you following me or what?"
"I need to call someone."
"We do a lot of surfing."
"I'll keep up to date."
"I don't think like that."
"My office is over there."
"But who are these people?"
"It's mud."
"You're going to get caught."
"I try to stay calm."
"Everyone is here."
"It's great art."
"Would you like to walk without shoes?"
"Where are you meeting?"
"Yes, whatever you want."
"Yes, I learned that."
"Have you read them all?"
"And I'm happy about it."
"Thank you for coming, doctor."
"I'll let you settle in."
"Don, can I talk to you?"
"You didn't know anything about it?"
"Yes, if you say so."
"You have to understand something."
"Who am I to you?"
"She's in the pound."
"She's the one in charge."
"Are you going to the party?"
"What do you plan to do now?"
"You should try it sometime."
"What is the police doing here?"
"We see other things."
"What do I need?"
"I have a long arm."
"Please, baby."
"It could take forever."
"Where did you send it?"
"I haven't seen them."
"Actually, it was me."
"No, I don't mind."
"I need to know something."
"Yes, she is my wife."
"I read your novel."
"How could it be?"
"He is with a girl."
"Enough for a new head?"
"I will love you forever."
"She had a boyfriend."
"He deserves better than this."
"You don't have a car?"
"You were a great friend."
"The journey is going to be long."
"He is my right arm."
"I'll make things right."
"Please accept."
"You are living in a dream."
"One minute, please."
"I love being with you."
"We need to move faster."
"I need them tomorrow."
"There are advantages."
"I'll get some plates."
"He's the one calling."
"He looks awesome."
"I went to her house."
"At least for me."
"I'm going to close the window."
"What did she expect?"
"I didn't drink anything."
"What do you think about that?"
"How about we go to my place?"
"No, he's my husband."
"Are you a sissy?"
"I was having a little fun."
"I'm here for the announcement."
"They won this round."
"My name is Allison Dubois."
"And she said yes."
"Would you like to open the door?"
"I'll tell you about it."
"I'm going to get the police."
"Can we call someone?"
"And it still is."
"From time to time, yes."
"I had it removed."
"This is the best, right?"
"As she said."
"Welcome to the real world."
"But it's better now."
"Everything has turned around now."
"Do you have enough space?"
"You're late, man."
"So, what do we do now?"
"That's it, my dear."
"We are on your side."
"When did he disappear?"
"Eagle One, this is Star One."
"I have to protect my son."
"Because of my wife."
"Did you see him do it?"
"I'm in the hallway."
"But he's my son."
"And what does that do to you?"
"We'll be there in a minute."
"You would need antibiotics."
"Did you expect that?"
"Let's try something new."
"It's all in the details."
"Are you from the area?"
"We're all there."
"Stay exactly where you are."
"They are all yours."
"Can I have the keys?"
"Have you seen any of them?"
"Have you seen your face?"
"Tell him to let go of me."
"She's not a girl."
"Can I have a kiss?"
"What is this badge?"
"It's first class."
"He must have had a reason."
"You're like everyone else."
"Put it inside."
"What if this is it?"
"Do you want me to repeat?"
"Is that your theory?"
"How much is it for?"
"I have to do some tests."
"He must know something."
"You investigated me."
"I'm just going to the bathroom."
"There is a 'but'."
"Do I look different?"
"She looks great."
"Oh, that's so sweet."
"You are an intelligent woman."
"Dad, don't say that."
"Let's put on some music."
"Is this the right number?"
"I declare the meeting open."
"Are you asking yourself the question?"
"I was the one driving."
"You come whenever you want."
"I saw them do it."
"He belongs to my father."
"I am proud of myself."
"It won't happen again, I promise."
"I got you again."
"Can I make a comment?"
"It can last for hours."
"I feel all different."
"Let's stick to the facts."
"You are all against me."
"You've gained weight."
"No, I don't feel anything."
"Go ahead, have fun."
"I wanted to see your reaction."
"He came to get her."
"I have ballistic expertise."
"It's a big night."
"That's a bit much."
"Because you are different."
"Is that right, Captain?"
"He is a brilliant man."
"No, he's my friend."
"I have eye contact."
"She needs money."
"That he had plans?"
"She doesn't want to talk."
"I saw his file."
"It was a good speech."
"I thought you were working."
"I'll get a bandage."
"Shall we get to work?"
"You are a rational being."
"Not for money."
"A little more over there."
"He took it from me."
"They're all gone, right?"
"I read his book."
"It makes you feel good."
"How was it last night?"
"Not just about animals."
"Because he's black?"
"Everyone was."
"He betrayed us all."
"What is your wife's name?"
"When did you meet him?"
"It was for his own good."
"Do you like another one?"
"I'm going to tidy up a bit."
"If you have one."
"Has this ever happened to him?"
"Yes, he is very handsome."
"When can I see you again?"
"They know where she is."
"What's your game?"
"They thought of everything."
"I understand you, you know."
"You have a strong heart."
"Wouldn't that be wonderful?"
"A little common sense."
"Thank you for taking my call."
"Give this to your mother."
"I'm not ready yet."
"I will make myself very small."
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
"And how do you plan to do it?"
"Attention to all units."
"I know, it's true."
"We make a great team."
"Did you see your attacker?"
"We will be together forever."
"This is my best offer."
"I'm here to win."
"No, I'm a friend."
"Thank you again for coming."
"I could take care of that."
"Did you get caught?"
"His body was found."
"Can you come back later?"
"Go as far as you can."
"As if I knew."
"What do you want, exactly?"
"She's a wimp."
"You have to swallow something."
"I called your mother."
"What do you take me for?"
"How is my big boy doing?"
"I sent flowers."
"He's right behind you."
"You don't work here."
"I know, I get it."
"I need someone."
"But I can do it."
"What can happen to us?"
"At the top of the stairs."
"I'm no better."
"I recognize her well there."
"We are in the United States."
"I have a lot of experience."
"You should take a shower."
"But I'll get there."
"Do you remember the name?"
"It belonged to my father."
"Were you in love with him?"
"Did you get an offer?"
"What I can do."
"It's over for us."
"Boarding pass and passport."
"Thank you, I feel better."
"I'm not sulking."
"We have different styles."
"She is with me now."
"He is mentally ill."
"I have to do my job."
"I ate with them."
"They didn't understand."
"You are more than welcome."
"Yes, I'm sure."
"You have things in common."
"What we did."
"But you must know this."
"Do you have another card?"
"Yes, we can do that."
"This can't go on."
"I see it like that."
"There is an inscription."
"You have to tell us."
"Not all at once."
"Who are you hiding from?"
"She already has one."
"Yeah, he's right there."
"Not one more day."
"You need to eat."
"A sleight of hand."
"I don't protect him."
"You just have to find it."
"Yeah, I'll do that."
"He's a straight guy."
"And who said that?"
"There is a protocol."
"It's a pleasant surprise."
"I might get a taste for it."
"I want to see the person in charge."
"No, I'm telling the truth."
"You have to keep your strength up."
"But I have one condition."
"Let's go see inside."
"We got your message."
"He thinks he comes from the future."
"That's my name."
"Uh, I have to go."
"That's him, right there."
"It was a lovely evening."
"This is our man."
"This is a restricted area."
"It will only take a second."
"We found someone."
"I was talking nonsense."
"This one says he knows you."
"You're going to make me throw up."
"You have to leave town."
"I need a map."
"Do you have a good lawyer?"
"Is he here or not?"
"The man for the job."
"She doesn't."
"It's a beautiful morning."
"Yes, they did."
"But, are you up for it?"
"Dad didn't come?"
"How many months has it been?"
"The master or the apprentice?"
"Will you open the door for me?"
"Let's go, everyone."
"The King's Dwarf Uncle."
"We'll see when the time comes."
"You have to be very careful."
"You were right about everything."
"Two minutes ago."
"Should I call security?"
"This is a good element."
"Do you like to party?"
"He was a good dog."
"I'm in the living room."
"We are your humble servants."
"This book is mine."
"I ask you one thing."
"Do you have a better explanation?"
"I want to hear his voice."
"You are different from others."
"How does this thing work?"
"I can go get it."
"There is a dam."
"The world ends like this."
"So she played along."
"Nobody talked about it."
"I had a child."
"I have to see my wife."
"I'll find out soon."
"Can you speak less loudly?"
"He is an extraordinary man."
"I'll see her later."
"Everyone will be fine."
"It's for all of us."
"You look cool."
"I'll wait for you up there."
"You see, whenever you want."
"Just saying."
"Are we expected this time?"
"Don't you want to try?"
"This is what I was looking for."
"I was nearby."
"It's just a dance."
"He is beside himself."
"One foot after the other."
"No, it's my mother."
"She knows who I am."
"If that is your wish."
"But I am a man."
"The bridge is yours."
"If you were mine."
"I felt the same way."
"Something or someone?"
"He has the means."
"I'll give you two."
"He will take care of everything."
"Let us take care of it."
"Are we going to the hotel?"
"You should go out more often."
"You have a lot to do."
"I have to go back to the store."
"You remember that, right?"
"This is a good photo."
"Half is mine."
"I do this for myself."
"Again and again and again."
"Do you want me to dance?"
"I'll try to talk to him."
"What should I think about it?"
"We have to do it together."
"There is a colony."
"How do I get home?"
"Can we go back?"
"Do you want to come to my place?"
"They know who feeds them."
"It was the only time."
"It's a perfect plan."
"I can get used to it."
"Tell me where we're going."
"He got had."
"I want to see the movie."
"Have you read the book?"
"I drank two glasses."
"She has green eyes."
"No, you can go."
"She looks smart."
"I'll look into that later."
"But he wasn't there."
"And the year before?"
"Look the other way."
"She doesn't talk much."
"It's business as usual."
"I am a respectable man."
"When did you write this?"
"Are you doing this for me?"
"Now it's mine."
"I can show it to you."
"Of course it matters."
"Go play in your room."
"When did you find out?"
"You are in love with me."
"Do you want to come in and examine it?"
"Keep them safe."
"But you thought it."
"I know others."
"No, it's the Flow."
"I know the people involved."
"At least it's clear."
"I should have come earlier."
"I'm getting out of a relationship."
"Let's get one thing straight."
"You're just a wimp."
"I found the body."
"I like how it sounds."
"We're going to draw lots."
"May His will be done."
"He's making fun of me."
"I need tools."
"Are you listening to me or what?"
"You will feel better tomorrow."
"It has everything in it."
"Actually, it's true."
"It's in the basement."
"We found a donor."
"Don't move from there."
"I woke up here."
"A pleasure to meet you."
"Gone with the Wind?"
"We are inside."
"It tastes like it."
"You are a busy man."
"He's going to do something."
"I'm coming to see my brother."
"I took the call."
"It comes down to this."
"I forgot to ask."
"My opinion doesn't count?"
"That's it, guys."
"I have other ambitions."
"I'm going to the mall."
"Are you coming to do some shopping?"
"I'm from security."
"He knows where to find me."
"She won't know."
"Will you leave us for a moment?"
"Do you know where to find it?"
"How do you feel about me?"
"It's like a miracle."
"The Shadow and the Flame."
"Don't you want to watch?"
"I know how to get there."
"Are you taking this seriously?"
"Slowly, please."
"Are you in your room?"
"They are already on their way."
"I think you're in good shape."
"Hallowed be thy name."
"That's pretty good, right?"
"Don't you see them?"
"I've seen it all."
"What do you mean he's gone?"
"She didn't say that."
"I didn't ask for that."
"Can I take my things?"
"What do you say to this?"
"You should know something."
"It's very quiet here."
"We are on time."
"Sorry for bringing it up."
"He never does that."
"We'll get it later."
"If that's how it is."
"This is also my favorite."
"I had it done."
"I'll take care of it, thank you."
"You should get treatment."
"A dinner would be nice."
"Met the general or me?"
"We certainly have been."
"You have to turn around."
"He is heartbroken."
"I was behind the door."
"You freaked us out."
"Where should I stand?"
"No, it doesn't exist."
"Please find safe shelter."
"Are you on my side?"
"He thinks he's God."
"All this in one week?"
"Did you take the money?"
"She can't take it anymore."
"They shot at us."
"A big fat hot dog."
"Not really a personal message."
"Where are you from, Willard?"
"It must come from here."
"There is a regulation."
"He is nice to me."
"I get in the car."
"This is a first step."
"I opened the window."
"Is this love?"
"I'm going to pack my things."
"Haven't you found anything better?"
"He may have come home."
"But I am his wife."
"He'll be pleased."
"Let's go on another tour."
"It will not be so."
"I'm just telling the truth."
"That's good, sweetie."
"I like watching TV."
"What do you want for Christmas?"
"Now I have one."
"Tell whatever you want."
"They are good kids."
"I come from very far away."
"It has to be done right."
"He's just a guy."
"I was paying you a compliment."
"I'll take it with me."
"Put it in the truck."
"I still love you so much."
"I wanted to do you a favor."
"Do you want to go for a walk?"
"I live in the present moment."
"Ah, I don't know."
"I worked for them."
"I can't have them."
"A gift to celebrate."
"I have to remember that."
"We're going to the police."
"Do you believe in God now?"
"We're on a case."
"You had us good."
"He is sure of himself."
"He was another man."
"I needed company."
"It's a big commitment."
"She must not know anything."
"She'll be here in a minute."
"It will take a few minutes."
"In all fairness."
"It looks lovely."
"What was this guy's name?"
"You'll never find it."
"That's great for you."
"I prefer to stay with you."
"I saw the sign."
"I'm in the middle of a divorce."
"That's a good theory."
"It went by so fast."
"Who doesn't know him?"
"When are you going to do it?"
"Can I touch your face?"
"It's better to go there."
"This is my little sister."
"No speeding."
"In the meeting room."
"You were there for me."
"Are you going to university?"
"Can I see your ticket?"
"Who doesn't know that?"
"Tell me another story."
"Are you going to let him do it?"
"I'll tell you what."
"No, I didn't want to."
"I can show them to you."
"Know that I love you."
"I said goodbye."
"A gift from me."
"Otherwise, I'll call the police."
"Whose is it then?"
"Would you let me teach you?"
"Take this and get out."
"Months ago."
"I obeyed orders."
"Can you read and write?"
"Did we miss something?"
"The press conference begins."
"He left his wife."
"A moment ago."
"It won't happen to you."
"He was my first love."
"I found him outside."
"This is the biggest."
"There are two doors."
"Your brother wants to talk to you."
"That was the easiest."
"This is a classic case."
"I am a rich man."
"I wanted to ask you for forgiveness."
"I just want answers."
"You have a long arm."
"Do you want to see pictures?"
"It's a long road."
"She is a real beauty."
"You don't want to leave?"
"What did you promise him?"
"The judge is God."
"Is she home?"
"No one saw them."
"He was a good father."
"He already has one."
"I saw your look."
"Spider-Man was a hero."
"I want you to win."
"But are you coming with us?"
"How many cameras do you have?"
"Do you still want to go?"
"Yes, you're probably right."
"Money buys happiness."
"You don't have any more?"
"She didn't arrive."
"I really like your hair."
"It was every man for himself."
"We get along very well."
"No, why do you say that?"
"Everything will be fine for him."
"No one ever is."
"I'll tell you outside."
"Do you have a spare change?"
"Yeah, I can do that."
"Both of you shut up."
"Use your intuition."
"You can make your dreams come true."
"Do you want to do this here?"
"I'm waiting to see that."
"You look distracted."
"I thought I was done."
"I'm in business."
"I was going to take a shower."
"They were shot at."
"He gives without expecting anything."
"What's your name, honey?"
"And I liked it."
"This wine is good."
"It's always a good sign."
"I tried twice."
"I'll give you the lowdown."
"A long journey awaits us."
"The two machines before half."
"As if it were easy."
"Do you exercise?"
"He is a former military man."
"But you have to be careful."
"I saw your ship."
"This is really very important."
"She's my only friend."
"You need a drink."
"Go easy on her."
"Who needs money?"
"I like your friends."
"Someone took them."
"Are you coming for a coffee?"
"The case was closed."
"No, that's my name."
"It has become a habit."
"I would do the same thing."
"What's the surprise?"
"It's a simple exchange."
"But you like him."
"You don't ask any."
"We got the shooter."
"Did she ask you?"
"We are looking for a new life."
"You can leave a message."
"Beth is in the hospital."
"I had a lot of fun."
"This is my first choice."
"Do you want to visit the house?"
"I keep calling."
"Do you feel the same way?"
"You have trained us well."
"The third flower is green."
"Have you read my book?"
"You have to get rid of it."
"We'll have you examined."
"But what else to do?"
"Look how pretty it is."
"And that scares them."
"I would recognize him among a thousand."
"I hear the bells ringing."
"They are doing their best."
"Have you seen him lately?"
"It looks beautiful."
"He's yours now."
"What did I do to them?"
"Want to see more?"
"I can answer that."
"You don't believe her?"
"We feel good at home."
"Who do I think I am?"
"Put this in the trunk."
"I like your house."
"The road is still long."
"Can we afford it?"
"We did our duty."
"I keep it on me."
"At your command, Captain."
"I'll go through the back."
"I'm with the group."
"How does it feel to you?"
"I'm just taking a look."
"He was there this morning."
"I made a copy."
"There was a party."
"Focus on the moment."
"Do you want to go talk to him?"
"I made cookies."
"No, don't touch me."
"I can't hear it anymore."
"I gave him some."
"Was this your first time?"
"Oh, that's very pretty."
"I bet you it does."
"No, we'll get there."
"It reminds me of a story."
"I forgot the keys."
"Yours and mine."
"Have I made myself clear?"
"I'll get them for you."
"But I trust you."
"You're acting like a child."
"It's a bit high."
"What was his name again?"
"Do you mind if I call?"
"I return to my office."
"He is ours now."
"I'll get the papers."
"I have to call my daughter."
"You're not making any effort."
"I came to say goodbye to him."
"Yes, it's going well."
"There were traffic jams."
"You are a pretty girl."
"I wanted to get rid of it."
"Weeks ago."
"We were in the area."
"No, don't leave me."
"Because you're right."
"You always liked it."
"He came by this morning."
"I've loved you for a long time."
"It lives up to its name."
"Not that long ago."
"She called the police."
"No more than an hour."
"Did you see the match?"
"You have reached your destination."
"I want to speak to the chief."
"Don't you want to see her?"
"I prefer the great outdoors."
"Would you please follow me?"
"It was for the smell."
"It happened very quickly."
"I feel perfectly fine."
"Will there be girls?"
"Didn't they tell you?"
"I'm going to mass."
"Can you describe it to me?"
"Bubba was my best friend."
"She never left."
"It was just for fun."
"I'll be in the lobby."
"He is in the hallway."
"What is plan B?"
"I did it again."
"They are ready to go."
"If this is your destiny."
"I've barely started."
"Don't you miss him?"
"I came to tell you."
"Do they all have a system?"
"I closed the door."
"What's your type?"
"Where did he go again?"
"You taught me a lot."
"All this hides something else."
"They never came."
"He's an ex-cop."
"How can I make up for it?"
"Who closed the door?"
"It was a great day."
"What are our other options?"
"Three bullets in the chest."
"He's going to pay for this."
"Good things happen."
"I'm surprised by you."
"I am safe and sound."
"I slept with you."
"Please, señor."
"I'll find the money."
"Where is he taking her?"
"Or you don't want to?"
"She was worth it."
"I'll give you my seat."
"Take whichever you want."
"Are there any here?"
"Because it was necessary."
"For you, it's over."
"How long will you last?"
"You're out of it."
"I'm talking to you about now."
"Can we count on you?"
"This is censorship."
"She was my grandmother."
"Everything looks delicious."
"Take microbes, for example."
"I only have her."
"Quick, we're late."
"Did you tell them everything?"
"I was his best friend."
"She didn't listen."
"To you and to me."
"I'll find his number."
"And keep me posted."
"I can't even imagine."
"I did him a favor."
"Where is she hiding?"
"I have to see my father."
"But something has changed."
"He went through."
"Blend in."
"He came this morning."
"He's on the plane."
"You never came back."
"And what do I do now?"
"Can I turn on the radio?"
"Do you live with someone?"
"What do you mean by 'naked'?"
"Yes, you need it."
"Have you seen the newspapers?"
"We must continue to negotiate."
"Thank you very much for dinner."
"Of course, that's true."
"He does have a name."
"Let me take a picture."
"Does my father know?"
"I read this book."
"He made a choice."
"Let's see where we are."
"I live just around the corner."
"Is there any beer left?"
"You're supposed to be resting."
"What did I see?"
"They know who we are."
"They went home."
"Whatever he wants."
"Only you can do it."
"Why are you interested in it?"
"I'll give you one."
"He has the right to do so."
"You'd better back off."
"So join us."
"I've read them all."
"Did she take drugs?"
"That's a fact."
"No, don't tell him anything."
"Just a day or two."
"He looks adorable."
"You don't really think so."
"Everyone, gather around."
"Do you want a cold one?"
"We've come this far."
"We'll be there in a few minutes."
"I have to find a solution."
"Give me a reasonable time frame."
"He has a history, doctor."
"Who do you want to talk to?"
"You're on my team."
"Because they can."
"I want to go see him."
"All the signs are there."
"It's part of the contract."
"Do you already have someone?"
"Well, it is."
"They changed cars."
"Yours or mine?"
"Answer if you're there."
"I'm going to win this time."
"You're not following me?"
"We can read you."
"This is a preliminary hearing."
"Anakin was a good friend."
"Was your day good?"
"Do you want more of me?"
"I would really like to talk to you."
"It's made for you."
"You don't love him anymore?"
"There is a void."
"I received my orders."
"Who's in the closet?"
"But you don't want to."
"This forest is mine."
"One behind the other."
"But you know it now?"
"Maybe they are right."
"This is the real truth."
"I can't swallow anything."
"Dad told me."
"That's what we call it."
"You don't want to say anything?"
"Did you win the lottery?"
"This is the best idea."
"We're fine like this."
"He's around."
"I put an end to it."
"I really like your work."
"He's a real tough guy."
"I am the Chancellor's Ambassador."
"Do you think you can do better?"
"Did he contact you?"
"I am trustworthy."
"I take it all on myself."
"Give him space."
"He is a great artist."
"How much did you give him?"
"You have to choose your side."
"Shall I make you a coffee?"
"That's all for him."
"Don't forget my secret."
"Are you old friends?"
"Give me some good news."
"She is on the roof."
"He overdosed."
"It all started from there."
"She is in a safe place."
"When is the audition?"
"But how can we be sure?"
"They are in the kitchen."
"I almost was."
"I should have prevented this."
"I can do it, Dad."
"I did it yesterday."
"You are a wonderful man."
"Well, can we go?"
"It's in my room."
"I just got them."
"I went to your house."
"Maybe we'll see each other."
"I have influence."
"You look very good."
"I have sensitive skin."
"He took my son."
"We made our decision."
"I am a good doctor."
"I must see the king."
"You'll see, you'll like it."
"The other side of what?"
"It's just noise."
"I just wanted to say thank you."
"I want to see the world."
"It suits everyone."
"Are you going to stay a while?"
"You can stay at my place."
"This is my toy."
"I need a tuxedo."
"We are very grateful to you."
"You are an educated man."
"It comes from my father."
"They came in through there."
"Why did you bring her?"
"No one should ever learn this."
"I want to see the director."
"You're going to get out of here."
"It's a nice word."
"Have you always lived here?"
"And I want the truth."
"My papers are in order."
"My place is with you."
"But we must act quickly."
"You're not together?"
"It is a hidden city."
"It's against my religion."
"It's a special evening."
"He looks strong."
"It must be like this."
"Is that your boss?"
"Not at the expense of the present."
"It happened so fast."
"It's in a day."
"Everything looks perfect."
"I swear to my God."
"I will count the votes."
"We heard shots."
"You're the crazy one."
"Did they come to see you?"
"He is on the way."
"He has an appointment."
"But what time is it?"
"You were a good apprentice."
"How are you doing since then?"
"You already have an apprentice."
"Is everyone whole?"
"A connection with the planet."
"I'm going to find a job."
"I did both."
"I'm going to make more coffee."
"She was my girlfriend."
"That's the first thing."
"I admire your work very much."
"You are a good agent."
"Everything is fine, my angel."
"Come to my office tomorrow."
"And where is your mother?"
"It's their livelihood."
"Something happened to me."
"Can we talk a little?"
"It was a great moment."
"I do it myself."
"The throne ship is approaching."
"Maybe not."
"I just stopped by to say hello."
"I would like to go with you."
"The principle is the same."
"What do you want to show me?"
"Dad, I can do it."
"You should talk to him about it."
"He knows where I live."
"I knew she would come back."
"But why are you doing this?"
"I saw you too."
"Susie told me."
"What are you going to call it?"
"The girl is coming with me."
"This is my little cousin."
"Welcome home, son."
"I've already planned everything."
"I'm not shaved."
"Did he take something?"
"It's a long list."
"Get on all fours."
"I couldn't say."
"It's steel."
"What is he getting involved in?"
"You need a doctor."
"I didn't hide anything."
"You're going to tell me everything."
"The target is moving."
"She is a remarkable woman."
"Do you want to go that way?"
"So, who are you betting on?"
"I'm going to see my son."
"I've done enough."
"Do we have everyone?"
"I'll owe you one."
"Is it the same helicopter?"
"I'll text you."
"Your attention determines your reality."
"Is it alcohol?"
"We don't touch anything."
"He shits on people."
"Here's how we're going to do it."
"But I'm coming with you."
"Do you know all these people?"
"You are as you are."
"Sixth, at the end of the corridor."
"Who is she talking to?"
"We must be very close."
"Yes, it was very good."
"Think of yourself first."
"Where is he anyway?"
"I'll drop you a line."
"What is this room?"
"You're tough, aren't you?"
"You'd better come inside."
"Where is the other half?"
"Answer yes or no."
"How do you remember it?"
"This path is hidden from me."
"I do everything myself."
"How can you not love them?"
"Have fun, girls."
"Was there anything else?"
"I will swallow your soul."
"I'll be back, I promise."
"This is my strong point."
"He was there last night."
"I already have someone."
"Do you want to watch a movie?"
"You owe me a dollar."
"It's a long walk."
"We are on the way."
"I owe you a drink."
"Everyone was talking about it."
"Give us our daily bread."
"I don't drink coffee."
"I am perfectly aware."
"It's just a rehearsal."
"You should get started."
"I finished my homework."
"I don't like school."
"They cut the power."
"I came by train."
"You don't feel like it?"
"Don't do this to him."
"She calls all the time."
"I just want an answer."
"I ask you a favor."
"It was in his pocket."
"Just before coming here."
"Go ahead, I'll follow you."
"How far is it?"
"We need more men."
"I am a businessman."
"What's blocking it?"
"Get ready for school."
"You are a free woman."
"What if you were right?"
"I'll come back down right away."
"I was on time."
"Take a day off."
"Of course you know."
"You must contact the Republic."
"Does she mean anything to you?"
"I want to be someone."
"He seems friendly."
"I need men."
"It would have been with her."
"The bill, please."
"Remember your promise."
"Can I have a candy?"
"But the situation has changed."
"I know, I'll take you."
"Not at all, my dear."
"You've done your time."
"Do you want some music?"
"We wonder why."
"It's easy to check."
"At the house's expense."
"Yes, she is very pretty."
"It will be good for you."
"You must be very excited."
"Why should I be?"
"They are going south."
"Watch over her, O Lord."
"You look ready."
"The gods willed it."
"I tell you it is."
"There is a swimming pool."
"Because I wanted to."
"Did you go to war?"
"This is an energy cell."
"She is with someone."
"I need gas."
"He's in your room."
"It was her or me."
"Oh, that's very kind."
"Dinner is on me."
"You didn't have any."
"He is at the church."
"It's in my file."
"You can ask me anything."
"We saw the result."
"Your intuition was right."
"We are approaching the house."
"Did you pay for this?"
"He explained everything to me."
"Are you Miss December?"
"It's just a suggestion."
"Can I have the definition?"
"I was talking about my career."
"I'm going to make dinner."
"Who is he to you?"
"It has to be real."
"You heard the doctor."
"Do you read lips?"
"The Federation is absent."
"It's a good cause."
"I heard very well."
"I just want to rest."
"But where do they come from?"
"A commission must be created."
"They are in the hospital."
"Wait, I'll explain."
"This promises to be interesting."
"To end up like the others?"
"I was blindfolded."
"There are eight of them."
"It's a great party."
"Anything else."
"The kid, in the well."
"No one can enter it."
"We have a big day."
"They are all my friends."
"I have to get to mine."
"Let's not talk about me."
"I will be on time."
"Look, it's for you."
"How does it work for you?"
"Just things."
"Downstairs, in the basement."
"Show me how it works."
"How much did he say?"
"I never see them."
"He's a little genius."
"He became a man."
"We are on the scene."
"Just a little water."
"Close the exit signs."
"He was in the car."
"Something bit me."
"You are tough in business."
"I don't think so anymore."
"Is this the right way?"
"You are her best friend."
"We captured the queen."
"I don't argue."
"How about a beer?"
"Can he do something?"
"Keep your eyes wide open."
"Is he coming?"
"What's with that accent?"
"I'll find one."
"Not as good as me."
"And the handbag."
"Do you think he'll come back?"
"Does he make you wash it?"
"He is in the living room."
"No one helped me."
"You must have a reason."
"I have an excellent memory."
"You are a good guy."
"Is he talking?"
"That's a lot, I imagine."
"It's a real job."
"It all started like this."
"You can, if you want."
"What was that voice?"
"Prepare the ship to jump."
"Let me be clearer."
"I press the button."
"But you will do it."
"I saw you talking."
"I have always been independent."
"If you are there, answer."
"These are his own words."
"I taste, daughter of Isis."
"I wanted to do something."
"She's my daughter too."
"I'm one too."
"It was before the war."
"That must have been hard."
"Tell them who you are."
"What is this construction site?"
"Did I do that?"
"I just wanted to have fun."
"He is on parole."
"She looks like it."
"It was his last wish."
"He's still a kid."
"Thank you very much for being here."
"What did you put in it?"
"What happened to my angel?"
"I heard someone."
"It's psychology."
"Are you taking care of him?"
"You seem like a good fit for me."
"This is the classic move."
"He still knows, right?"
"How do you know how to do that?"
"Where did you learn it?"
"It was just an argument."
"I like it that way."
"Would you mind relaxing?"
"She is an intelligent woman."
"Now go to your room."
"It's a civil war."
"Several years ago."
"I'll make you dinner."
"His car is parked in front."
"Can I have an advance?"
"Can't you hear them?"
"He has a new family."
"You three, come with me."
"Can we go around?"
"Ah, it's nothing."
"An order is an order."
"That's exactly how it is."
"Why is he telling you this?"
"Put this against the wall."
"Smoke and mirrors."
"You come home early."
"Even I know that."
"I'm a pilot too."
"She has a lot of imagination."
"What does he work in?"
"What is the theme?"
"Did you call the doctor?"
"And a bottle of water."
"I see it in you."
"They're all the same."
"Are there any messages?"
"For You are with me."
"It's a bit big."
"You just talk."
"The floor is yours."
"Put whatever you want."
"He took my car."
"Do you want to stay like this?"
"Is this story true?"
"You have to think of everything."
"You will be proud of me."
"To your diving stations."
"And once there?"
"The voice of reason."
"She's still in the operating room."
"It's a pretty ring."
"What is this money?"
"The answer is over there."
"Who wants to be first?"
"Don't talk about her."
"And I do mine."
"But for good reasons."
"I should come more often."
"I remember it very well."
"You don't remember anything?"
"How did you get this number?"
"Where did you get this number?"
"I will always be there for you."
"I'll be there in an hour."
"Can I have a word with you?"
"What's the password?"
"I think I'm going home."
"I thought it was over."
"I am glad to see you."
"I want you to be happy."
"Do you think it's easy?"
"The pleasure was all mine."
"No, he won't."
"I knew it was going to happen."
"Did he say where he was going?"
"Did she say where she was going?"
"Can I ask you a favor?"
"They can be anywhere."
"No, I haven't forgotten."
"I knew you'd be there."
"I'll be back as soon as I can."
"Do you know who you're talking to?"
"I know what you're talking about."
"I would like to show you something."
"When were you going to tell me?"
"That's nice of you to say."
"There is another way."
"There is always a way."
"He started it."
"She started it."
"I guess you're right."
"I guess that's true."
"That's what it says."
"A coffee, please."
"Your name, please?"
"It went very well."
"It happened like this."
"Please listen to me."
"I know you can hear me."
"We should do this more often."
"It's a dead end."
"I'm glad to see you again."
"I'll tell you a secret."
"Can I tell you a secret?"
"Let me take care of this."
"This is the price to pay."
"I want to speak to my lawyer."
"Let me ask you something."
"I gave you an order."
"Please call me back."
"So what is it all about?"
"They are just words."
"I have to do it."
"That's what you believe."
"He knew what he was doing."
"Do you want me to show you?"
"I don't have an answer."
"It's all the same."
"It's a very pretty name."
"The ball is in your court."
"We are in the same camp."
"Is there another exit?"
"Can I have some water?"
"Oh, for God's sake."
"It's time to eat."
"I have to go to the hospital."
"Sorry about earlier."
"I've been told that before."
"Of course it is."
"Of course you are."
"Of course he is."
"It's dinner time."
"I think I have it."
"I know you are."
"I'm glad to hear it."
"They didn't."
"You need to go to the hospital."
"All the honor is mine."
"You haven't seen her?"
"Do you want me to call him?"
"I did it for us."
"Nobody told me."
"No, I don't have it."
"I saw him this morning."
"No, it wasn't."
"I saw him last night."
"Yes, he told me."
"I'm going to ask you a question."
"Can I ask you some questions?"
"He looks in good shape."
"It's the house that offers."
"Can I give you some advice?"
"Everyone at their posts."
"This is the final stretch."
"It's good for your health."
"It's lunch time."
"You only live once."
"You made the right decision."
"Let him go to hell."
"That's what I was doing."
"I knew what I was doing."
"This is what I prefer."
"I have to see him."
"We need to see each other."
"I have to see her."
"I think I'm in love."
"I'll wait for you in the car."
"Of course I love you."
"I think I love you."
"How did you do this?"
"I told you to leave."
"What will happen to us?"
"Did he say something to you?"
"Are there any questions?"
"I left you a message."
"She didn't tell you anything?"
"What happens now?"
"Did she say something to you?"
"You have nothing to tell me?"
"A beer, please."
"They know what they are doing."
"They know we're here."
"I hadn't planned that."
"This is what is planned."
"About an hour ago."
"I've got my eye on you."
"I took care of everything."
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"Any minute now."
"Do you agree with that?"
"It's someone else."
"Everyone agrees?"
"What else can be done?"
"Do you want a glass of water?"
"Would you like a glass of water?"
"I just had an idea."
"We had agreed."
"It's child's play."
"It's happening."
"Two for the price of one."
"It was someone else."
"It's a team effort."
"This is one of them."
"What did you do with her?"
"It's time to end this."
"I agree with that."
"I'm sure you understand."
"I thought you loved me."
"In memory of the good old days."
"I am delighted to meet you."
"It's showtime."
"I'm going to be honest with you."
"I won't go any further."
"I'm really proud of you."
"I am a man of my word."
"I only have one word."
"Can I offer you a drink?"
"There must be a solution."
"There is another solution."
"No, it is not necessary."
"I want you to have it."
"I'm taking you to the hospital."
"I brought you a gift."
"I brought you something to eat."
"Is this what you wanted?"
"It's me who thanks you."
"Your papers, please."
"It's the thought that counts."
"The operation went well."
"I'm going to tell you a story."
"Do you have an ID?"
"Can I talk to you in private?"
"Can I speak to you in private?"
"All right, I'm leaving."
"I need some advice."
"I need to see you."
"I have the situation in hand."
"I should have seen it coming."
"I hope everything is going well."
"I know I'm right."
"I hope this is important."
"I have a job for you."
"I forgot to tell you."
"I hope you're well."
"I heard about him."
"I did this for you."
"I would have done the same thing."
"You know what I would like?"
"I hope you're hungry."
"I always wanted to do this."
"I hope she's doing well."
"I would like to ask you a few questions."
"Where do you want me to go?"
"I can't stop thinking about it."
"I fully intend to."
"I hope that's true."
"I'm done with you."
"Of course I'm right."
"I might have something."
"I like your way of thinking."
"I should have told you about it."
"I have other things to do."
"I'll be two minutes."
"I hope you know that."
"I need to see him."
"I thought I heard something."
"I'm done with this."
"I'll arrive as soon as I can."
"I always wanted to go there."
"I had a good evening."
"Yes, I'll be right there."
"I need this job."
"I have that feeling."
"That's what I like."
"I have some business to attend to."
"I've been thinking about you a lot."
"I really need you."
"I would like to introduce you to someone."
"I have news for you."
"I have a hangover."
"I just need time."
"I have a mission for you."
"I wish you were here."
"I might have an idea."
"I hope it's good."
"I'll be five minutes."
"I would like to ask you a question."
"But I need you."
"Do you want me to go?"
"You know what I like?"
"There must be a connection."
"I'll count to three."
"It's up to me to decide."
"You are on the blacklist."
"I have never seen them."
"You want to get rid of me?"
"Want to join us?"
"That's what I hoped for."
"I was hoping you would say that."
"I need a shower."
"Is this what you're looking for?"
"I grew up on a farm."
"There are other ways."
"No, you won't."
"I want you to listen to me."
"I have some shopping to do."
"There was an explosion."
"She doesn't answer the phone."
"Half an hour ago."
"Do you think I enjoy it?"
"You need to know this."
"It crossed my mind."
"We'll talk about that later."
"This is what I propose to you."
"Would you like a cup of tea?"
"Follow me, please."
"There is another possibility."
"Wooden cross, iron cross."
"Where is the bathroom?"
"It was worth a try."
"I have never met her."
"I want you to go."
"It's a matter of principle."
"I don't recommend it."
"I never saw him again."
"I knew you'd like it."
"I hope we see each other again."
"I'll deal with it later."
"I'll take care of it myself."
"We'll deal with that later."
"I take that as a compliment."
"Sign here, please."
"Life is full of surprises."
"What's holding you back?"
"It looks like it's going to rain."
"I knew you would make it."
"I will never forgive myself."
"What are they making?"
"That's where I come in."
"Give me some time."
"Oh, for heaven's sake."
"You know I will."
"I'm at the end of my rope."
"I know she's there."
"She has the right to know."
"I brought you flowers."
"Do you hear what you're saying?"
"There is light."
"Go ahead, please."
"I didn't write that."
"What is true?"
"The pleasure is all ours."
"It's very close from here."
"It's hilarious."
"You shouldn't say that."
"Do you want me to take you back?"
"What would you do in my place?"
"Give him what he wants."
"I am what I am."
"Whose idea was it?"
"I know what you're going through."
"I'll try to remember that."
"We both are."
"Just like the good old days."
"I love you more than anything."
"There it is, I have it."
"But you won't."
"He'll be here in a minute."
"When was the last time?"
"I told him about you."
"I'm tired of waiting."
"I see what you're doing."
"But I didn't."
"I have no choice anymore."
"I'm going to ask you to leave."
"And you know what else?"
"Isn't that the truth?"
"No, that's out of the question."
"There was an incident."
"Have you heard of me?"
"I know who did this."
"I thought it was me."
"Thank you for picking me up."
"Tell him how you feel."
"I want to ask you a question."
"Look what I did."
"She was lucky."
"I saw light."
"Did you spend the night here?"
"She couldn't come."
"Do you want to join me?"
"I only think of you."
"That's what was planned."
"Can we move on?"
"Did the flight go well?"
"Come sit next to me."
"Is it because of that?"
"He does what he wants."
"Let them go to hell."
"One more, please."
"Did you tell him about me?"
"It will only take a few minutes."
"I have no one else."
"I made it myself."
"I don't have a son."
"I'll see you at home."
"I knew it from the beginning."
"I know you know that."
"Tell him I love him."
"Of course I know him."
"We are on the right track."
"I know you will."
"It's a staging."
"No, not everything is fine."
"It's a matter of respect."
"That's what we want."
"I want to see all the plans."
"I don't have a wife."
"No one comes in or goes out."
"I moved on."
"Only one way to find out."
"I want her to be happy."
"I was hoping you'd say that."
"What kind of man are you?"
"I read that somewhere."
"I have a job to do."
"I ask myself the same question."
"No, there is no one."
"I found it like this."
"I bought you a present."
"This name rings a bell."
"Do you think I like it?"
"It's a matter of survival."
"I'm going to ask you some questions."
"Do you know what he does?"
"What did you hope for?"
"See you inside."
"Don't you want to go?"
"What interests you?"
"I never loved you."
"We are from the same family."
"He has the right to know."
"What the hell are we doing?"
"It's on the house."
"They can't be far away."
"Because I said so."
"You want me to do it?"
"I suspected it a little."
"Let me show you something."
"I've always been like this."
"You know who I'm talking about."
"It's a matter of honor."
"I'll join you in a minute."
"I would if I could."
"What's he up to?"
"It's Christmas Eve."
"It's me you want."
"How much time does he have left?"
"See what you can do."
"You have nothing to do?"
"That's what it looks like."
"I live from day to day."
"Of course she is."
"Here's what I'm going to do."
"I told you about him."
"We have a job to do."
"It's far from over."
"There are a lot of people."
"I had things to do."
"I have to ask you a question."
"Who do you want it to be?"
"I want to hear you say it."
"I needed to see you."
"Because I'm a woman?"
"I love what I do."
"That's what he believes."
"You never were."
"I thought it was settled."
"What is love?"
"I'll get us something to drink."
"Everyone saw it."
"I wish you a good day."
"This is where I live."
"We learn something new every day."
"I never wanted it."
"Do you know how to use this?"
"I need your signature."
"I think he likes you."
"How are you so sure?"
"I've seen others."
"Nobody knows where she is."
"This is what we want."
"That's what I hope."
"It depends on your point of view."
"It's my day off."
"I'll be back later."
"I think it's over."
"I agree with her."
"I hope everything goes well."
"Honey, what's wrong?"
"Do you see what I'm talking about?"
"I know you love him."
"Come on guys, let's go."
"I'll take that as a no."
"Calm down, please."
"She is nothing to me."
"I take it as a compliment."
"That's absolutely correct."
"How much time do I have left?"
"He told me about you."
"I know you want it."
"Did you have a good evening?"
"I thought I saw something."
"That's what we wanted."
"Everyone please stay calm."
"What happened yesterday?"
"Of course it's me."
"This is what I expected."
"The countdown has begun."
"There are cameras everywhere."
"What's over?"
"This is a golden opportunity."
"I always wanted one."
"You know how spies are."
"You know what I see?"
"I think that's clear."
"No, we are not."
"I thought of something."
"I'll find someone else."
"I have feelings for you."
"We'll talk about it another time."
"This is what it is about."
"I'll make you some coffee."
"I didn't believe it."
"No, that won't be necessary."
"Come take a ride with me."
"Everything you need."
"I just said it like that."
"Are you seeing someone else?"
"Please go ahead."
"Yes, I told you."
"I need to think about it."
"I did it for myself."
"No, she's not well."
"Maybe it's a sign."
"It's good for business."
"Fill up, please."
"Did she say anything?"
"You don't want to talk to me?"
"It's our honeymoon."
"Like rock water."
"I'm so happy for you."
"I prefer not to say it."
"Did you give him a name?"
"Do you think it's him?"
"I don't have a husband."
"I love what you do."
"A little over a year."
"She's a tough cookie."
"This can't be it."
"What do we hear?"
"I am only a messenger."
"What really happened?"
"No, I don't."
"It will only take a moment."
"It's meal time."
"Tell him you love him."
"Can I drop you off somewhere?"
"There is water."
"What about him?"
"I was thinking the same thing."
"What's all the noise?"
"It's three o'clock in the morning."
"Can you tell me your name?"
"I don't want any excuses."
"Yes, what's going on?"
"I believe what I see."
"How much time do we have left?"
"Are you okay with that?"
"I have bills to pay."
"It's a point of view."
"Listen to me, please."
"I may have a solution."
"I'll tell him the truth."
"You would have done the same thing."
"I knew this day would come."
"What are you holding?"
"Is that how you feel?"
"It's me they want."
"I love you just the way you are."
"What exactly did he say?"
"It's a defense mechanism."
"I have another appointment."
"I think he likes me."
"You're going to need this."
"Stand up, please."
"It's time for me to go."
"No, he wasn't."
"You don't have family?"
"I know you like it."
"I must leave you."
"You're just a child."
"He has to go to the hospital."
"He knows I'm here."
"Until the end of time."
"I believe that's true."
"I just wanted to tell you."
"No, I don't believe you."
"Do you want me to walk you home?"
"Do you think it's me?"
"You think it's me?"
"They are not mine."
"It's our lucky day."
"It's a nice leg for me."
"It looks pretty good."
"Let this be a lesson to you."
"I don't see anything else."
"You know as much as I do."
"Glad you could come."
"The deal is in the bag."
"I want to speak to a lawyer."
"I did not order this."
"Did you want to tell me something?"
"I'll leave you both."
"Can I show you something?"
"I said it was fine."
"There is always one."
"You'll do just fine."
"You're doing the right thing."
"I know he's here."
"Maybe that's why."
"I had a long day."
"This is what I think about it."
"But this is the last time."
"Tell us what you know."
"I called everyone."
"Yes, I remember you."
"I'll go see who it is."
"I want to know who it is."
"What exactly happened?"
"I'll tell you something else."
"I'll be here for a while."
"He knows we're here."
"I say what I want."
"That's all in the past."
"I would like to ask you something."
"You know how I feel."
"Leave me alone, please."
"This is a piece of evidence."
"Maybe it was an accident."
"You don't want to talk about it?"
"That's what she wanted."
"I know how he feels."
"We need you here."
"Let's see what you can do."
"I'm glad to be here."
"I think you should leave."
"That's it, I get it."
"We had some good times."
"Do you have someone else?"
"I've seen all your movies."
"Have you ever seen this man?"
"I have an important meeting."
"I tried to talk to him."
"I have a train to catch."
"Can I see you for a minute?"
"Leave her out of it."
"There is another option."
"Did you cut your hair?"
"Who else could it be?"
"You're a good person."
"We're not talking about me."
"I thought I heard a noise."
"You can't always win."
"It doesn't matter anymore."
"There is always a solution."
"Can I see you for a second?"
"I might have a lead."
"He knows what he's talking about."
"Maybe that's true."
"That's a good idea, right?"
"I told you the truth."
"Did you say something to him?"
"I'm going to tell you a secret."
"I wish you a good night."
"I did it once."
"I'll tell you about it later."
"I realized it."
"She does what she wants."
"We have a plane to catch."
"Is it me you're looking for?"
"It's in all the newspapers."
"Do you know what it was?"
"Maybe it's a coincidence."
"As if I had a choice."
"Do you know why you are here?"
"No, it's not there."
"No, it's not."
"Is this her?"
"I have some things to take care of."
"How could I have forgotten?"
"We'll meet at the car."
"I am one of your fans."
"She can't be far away."
"You are not a man."
"No, he didn't say anything."
"This is what I did."
"That's what we think."
"I am only the messenger."
"It's the house that treats."
"You'll find out soon enough."
"There is a big difference."
"I should have trusted you."
"I'm going to go for a walk."
"I told you so, didn't I?"
"I told you, didn't I?"
"I need your car."
"I think I'm pregnant."
"I'm just saying, I'm not saying anything."
"I tried to tell him."
"I'll meet you at home."
"Tomorrow is the big day."
"We need to talk to him."
"You're going to have to trust me."
"I had a great evening."
"What is his last name?"
"I can take care of him."
"We can do better than that."
"I had a little accident."
"She has no choice."
"She had no choice."
"I swear on my life."
"Did you have a good day?"
"This is one of my favorites."
"I have things in hand."
"Is this what you are looking for?"
"There is so much to do."
"There is another reason."
"I see it in his eyes."
"I have to go to school."
"Do you have what it takes?"
"It's great to see you."
"This is where I work."
"I said it first."
"Where did you get this idea?"
"I'm going to get myself something to drink."
"I have a statement to make."
"Let's see what we have here."
"Do you have any brothers or sisters?"
"Give him some time."
"It works both ways."
"I have it in front of me."
"How did you find this place?"
"The sun will rise soon."
"It's time for dinner."
"I see through your game."
"Everyone did it."
"I need your opinion."
"It will be for next time."
"No, I told you."
"You know you want it."
"I swore to protect you."
"I just wanted to hear your voice."
"I've had more than enough."
"Smoking is prohibited here."
"I'd better go back."
"I could never do that."
"You're no match for me."
"You're not up to it."
"Anyone can do it."
"I met him once."
"Here's what's going to happen."
"I'm going to need you."
"May the Force be with you."
"I tried to call him."
"Who told you about this?"
"Do you want to go?"
"Not while I'm here."
"I think I love him."
"I want you to do it."
"Let's see what we can do."
"Looking for something specific?"
"When are you coming home?"
"I know who did it."
"You didn't see her."
"Of course they are."
"But you have to trust me."
"Do you know where he went?"
"I'm old school."
"What are the risks?"
"I have to take care of this."
"It's been over an hour."
"Did it work?"
"How did you get my number?"
"Do you think you're tough?"
"Did he tell you about me?"
"He never did."
"What happens next?"
"You know, don't you?"
"Do you have anything to add?"
"Let it not happen again."
"I mind my own business."
"It's because of him."
"Tell me what you have."
"I'm seasick."
"Can I offer you a coffee?"
"Why does everyone say that?"
"You are sure of yourself."
"Don't kid yourself."
"He didn't tell you?"
"I'm glad to hear that."
"I know it was you."
"Do you know who did this?"
"Can we do this later?"
"All right, I'll do it."
"I need a friend."
"If you will excuse us."
"You never loved me."
"You never did it."
"How can you ask me that?"
"Same as usual."
"I think it's me."
"What is your last name?"
"We have a surprise for you."
"It's easier that way."
"It went pretty well."
"She's too good for you."
"The game is worth the candle."
"I feel much better now."
"We have things to do."
"I never told him."
"I bought you something."
"I spoke to my father."
"I'm sure it will be fine."
"What kind of man is he?"
"It's about something else."
"No, they are not."
"That's what we thought."
"I don't take drugs."
"What did you want me to say?"
"I need another one."
"You're right, you're right."
"Have you ever been told this?"
"I'll put you on speakerphone."
"Do you still need me?"
"I want you to take this."
"But everything in its time."
"It's nice to see you again."
"You didn't listen to me?"
"No, I wouldn't say that."
"What's happening to them?"
"Are you the one who called?"
"It's between her and me."
"Do you want a cup of coffee?"
"You did well to come."
"You'll have to go over my body."
"I want everything to be perfect."
"You're getting on my nerves."
"I wanted to check on you."
"You want to play it like that?"
"We have the right to know."
"But there's a catch."
"I told him to come."
"Thank you for coming this far."
"Is this a marriage proposal?"
"I feel a little better."
"It's just for a few days."
"I'm going to get myself a drink."
"I had a good day."
"He'll be here in a moment."
"I've been waiting for this moment for a long time."
"You could have told me about it."
"I spoke to your mother."
"Where are you right now?"
"That's what I know."
"And I need you."
"He's old school."
"Do you want to play a game?"
"You know what would be good?"
"But you don't know that."
"I want you to take it."
"There is something out there."
"We do what we want."
"Where do you think you're going like this?"
"Of course I'm fine."
"I have what you want."
"What do you want to talk to me about?"
"In my jacket pocket."
"What were we saying?"
"You can stay if you want."
"Did the trip go well?"
"They'll be here in a minute."
"It's okay, it's over."
"I don't know what to believe."
"It's bath time."
"What awaits us?"
"It was nice to meet you."
"You and I, it's over."
"She can't do that."
"There is something fishy going on."
"Please, my God."
"I have homework to do."
"No, she's not."
"What else do you want to know?"
"I need to speak to you in private."
"You asked to see me?"
"Would you like a glass of wine?"
"I spoke to him this morning."
"It's on the other side."
"What is it, doctor?"
"I'm here to protect you."
"I hope you are happy."
"Everything is going to be fine."
"It was in all the newspapers."
"I wish you much happiness."
"He knows everything."
"You have to go to the hospital."
"I made the right choice."
"I have what I want."
"Do you like what you see?"
"I know you were close."
"No, I'm not saying that."
"It is an honor for me."
"I know how it goes."
"How are things at home?"
"This is how I see things."
"Let me buy you a drink."
"Thank you for thinking of me."
"I heard about that."
"I'm delighted to be here."
"There's only one left."
"She knows what she wants."
"I know you're right."
"No, I'm not going anywhere."
"I'll send you a postcard."
"Please hurry up."
"Something is happening here."
"I hope you're doing well."
"I want to talk to my wife."
"I almost didn't come."
"It's good to be here."
"Well, what's left of it."
"I want you to stay here."
"I'm not his father."
"You are safe with me."
"The question does not arise."
"That was a long time ago."
"Are you sure about this?"
"This time it's for real."
"Do you think it's over?"
"Do you want to go for a drink?"
"I just got your message."
"What if he doesn't come back?"
"I thought you would be happy."
"Everyone tells me that."
"I have to go to the airport."
"No, there is something else."
"Can I call you back later?"
"It's really important to me."
"I am living proof of that."
"It was good to see you."
"Actually, I have to go."
"This is just a theory."
"I expect nothing less."
"That would be the last straw."
"This is what we are going to do."
"I'll explain something to you."
"Could you do me a favor?"
"Does it matter?"
"What if he doesn't come?"
"Thanks for earlier."
"I'm really happy for you."
"We are what we are."
"Take your things and go back to camp."
"No, it's better not."
"I don't make the rules."
"He can't help it."
"I have something to take care of."
"How dare you speak to me like that?"
"I only have one."
"That's it, it's over."
"We'll find someone else."
"How much time do you need?"
"You've never seen it?"
"It's the gesture that counts."
"I love you, I love you."
"I'll do better next time."
"He did it for me."
"I've seen better days."
"I was the one who called."
"I want you to be there."
"It is out of the question."
"I know it was him."
"And I'll prove it to you."
"He's the one I want."
"You are not the same anymore."
"No, you're not going."
"What is good?"
"Can we join you?"
"May I ask your name?"
"We're both going."
"Do you think it's possible?"
"We can go wherever we want."
"You can go wherever you want."
"I'm giving you one last chance."
"No, I'm not interested."
"I almost had a stroke."
"Do you hear what I'm saying?"
"How are things going for you?"
"I will always be by your side."
"How long did I sleep?"
"There were deaths."
"I'll join you in a moment."
"There are other solutions."
"You are not yourself anymore."
"She says it's important."
"You did a great job."
"When will he be back?"
"Of course it's true."
"I always wanted to say that."
"I don't even think about it."
"I want us to be together."
"This is a first for me."
"He is a man of honor."
"I'm going to teach you something."
"I'm above that."
"It's something else."
"He does this all the time."
"It's stronger than you."
"We're taking you to the hospital."
"Your father would be proud of you."
"But it didn't happen."
"You know what, you're right."
"Don't make a big deal out of it."
"Did something happen to you?"
"Thank you for coming to see me."
"Did you see who it was?"
"There were others."
"I want to know everything about you."
"That's it, it's done."
"You and I are the same."
"I have a call to make."
"Please do it."
"And everyone knows it."
"What were you told?"
"That's what's important."
"I don't drink alcohol."
"Have you made any friends?"
"Maybe he's right."
"I understand what you are saying."
"It's not love."
"And it's thanks to you."
"Very good, very good, very good."
"What's wrong with that?"
"Do you know why you're here?"
"We're just having fun."
"I've got you, I've got you."
"What are you going to do with us?"
"I think he understood."
"Everyone has a price."
"I had never seen her."
"How do you know who I am?"
"Is anyone in there?"
"I think he's here."
"Do you think what I think?"
"I have something else for you."
"I think it's time."
"I can do it by myself."
"Sorry I scared you."
"What do you study?"
"Do you want us to break up?"
"I take full responsibility for it."
"You've never seen it."
"Not if I can help it."
"You don't have to answer."
"I'm a little busy right now."
"You are more beautiful than ever."
"I think we're ready."
"I know what he wants."
"What the hell is he doing?"
"I think I'm there."
"Let me give you some advice."
"And it's just getting started."
"The first round is on me."
"I did it for him."
"Let's not talk about that now."
"That's what's good."
"I need your advice."
"How did you get on?"
"It was a team effort."
"I would like to speak to you privately."
"Do you think that's it?"
"He got shot."
"Do you want me to take you?"
"Are you not well or what?"
"It's part of my job."
"It's his day off."
"Do you know where it comes from?"
"What do I risk?"
"You don't have children?"
"He who laughs last laughs best."
"I spent the night there."
"I know exactly who you are."
"Nothing is keeping me here anymore."
"How could he do that?"
"You'd better leave."
"It didn't last long."
"I guess it's possible."
"I wonder where he is."
"Your tickets, please."
"I'm homesick."
"I knew you would."
"I don't ask for more."
"I think it's possible."
"Do you want me to say it?"
"Have you ever done this before?"
"Sorry it took so long."
"I have some time."
"Aren't you at school?"
"It's self-defense."
"Whose birthday is it?"
"Don't bring her into this."
"There are other options."
"I made you some coffee."
"I have something for him."
"Why are you so sure?"
"You know what you're talking about."
"That's one way of doing it."
"What are you doing this weekend?"
"It was a figure of speech."
"I need the car."
"I have plenty more."
"I made you some tea."
"We must take action."
"I have some money."
"I thought you had stopped."
"She is part of the family."
"I have to get up early tomorrow."
"It's a love story."
"I need a moment."
"You don't have any money?"
"This is the only possible explanation."
"This is the Los Angeles Police Department."
"It's written in black and white."
"Okay, we get it."
"They all say the same thing."
"In every sense of the word."
"Maybe we should go."
"Show me what you've got."
"Is there another way out?"
"I wanted to see how you were doing."
"You could say it like that."
"I have never been married."
"You can come if you want."
"This is what we are looking for."
"You can tell me the truth."
"I've had enough of you."
"Looks good to me."
"I went there once."
"I'll be here for an hour."
"Your family needs you."
"You made me a promise."
"I think it is."
"You opened my eyes."
"I do what I like."
"Is this about that?"
"Do you think I like this?"
"Okay, here we are."
"My father told me."
"I have some work for you."
"You need to talk to him."
"We will do what is necessary."
"I made them myself."
"I need some fresh air."
"It's bedtime."
"Do you know what it looks like?"
"Where did you learn all this?"
"Can I go to my room?"
"I want us to be friends."
"No, I won't do that."
"This is the key to everything."
"I worked all night."
"What I always wanted."
"I think I know where he is."
"I'm surprised to see you."
"Did he make advances on you?"
"See you at church."
"In another life, perhaps."
"Of course he knows."
"There are millions of them."
"You don't want me?"
"It's time for lunch."
"I'm coming to say goodbye to you."
"I'm feeling great."
"I don't have the answer."
"What was I doing?"
"We found it like this."
"Do you two know each other?"
"In English, please."
"It's a play on words."
"I think we're done."
"Don't bring him into this."
"This is probably a good idea."
"What time is your flight?"
"No, he doesn't."
"There is surely an explanation."
"It can't be her."
"I would like to introduce someone to you."
"Did you tell him about us?"
"That's one good thing done."
"It's tea time."
"I don't expect anything from you."
"Out of sight, out of mind."
"I am just an intermediary."
"It's the moment of truth."
"How did the interview go?"
"I want you to say it."
"Looks like it worked."
"All right, I'll take care of it."
"Can I leave him a message?"
"I think they left."
"Two coffees, please."
"Why are you telling me this now?"
"It is a masterpiece."
"As I told you."
"Here's what you're going to do."
"Yes, you told me."
"He must be around."
"What are you hoping for?"
"You could call it that."
"Please talk to me."
"No, he's not well."
"Do you want me to tell him?"
"I can't do that to him."
"I could have done something."
"You did well to call."
"You know how I know that?"
"They were lucky."
"What's going on now?"
"I have one for you."
"We'll see how it goes."
"This is what it means."
"No, I wouldn't."
"You have to go to school."
"I have to be honest with you."
"If there is one."
"I don't know what to answer."
"I barely touched it."
"No, I'm not married."
"I won't answer that."
"We have something in common."
"A whiskey, please."
"I never asked for anything."
"No rest for the brave."
"He is a businessman."
"Yes, there is one."
"I knew you would be here."
"What am I making?"
"Have you spoken to your mother?"
"Can I be honest with you?"
"How do you want me to do it?"
"It is the will of the gods."
"It's just water."
"Get that through your head."
"It can only be that."
"It's just for one night."
"I know it is."
"You're the one who left."
"I'll bring you some water."
"Yes, I remember her."
"I was wondering the same thing."
"It's just a legend."
"I have some errands to run."
"Take whatever you want."
"That's the rule of the game."
"I think she's right."
"You don't need it anymore."
"Do you think he's here?"
"Maybe he knows something."
"Aren't we all?"
"She needs a doctor."
"There is a curfew."
"Everything went as planned."
"I'm always here for you."
"You know more than I do."
"Let's see what I can do."
"It makes me want to throw up."
"Do you know what you are doing?"
"We'd better go."
"I live only for this."
"Do you know what we call that?"
"She is not a woman."
"I always believed in you."
"I think that's true."
"Do you want to see something cool?"
"I knew I was right."
"I don't mean that."
"That's what they believe."
"Of course I remember."
"I'll be back in half an hour."
"Please wake up."
"I always told you."
"Yes, she told me."
"He's a good-for-nothing."
"I have to go back to the hospital."
"Of course I love him."
"Tell him what you want."
"Did you figure this out on your own?"
"Did you come up with this on your own?"
"She told me about you."
"I saw him once."
"I never loved her."
"I am very happy for you."
"There are people here."
"Yeah, I've heard about it."
"I could have told you."
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"They weren't."
"What am I missing?"
"She knew what she was doing."
"It's you he wants."
"That's what she is."
"Do you have something in mind?"
"Think about what you are doing."
"Can I take your picture?"
"I know you would."
"The rules are the rules."
"I have my say."
"I will be there as soon as possible."
"I did it this morning."
"I knew it, I knew it."
"They do what they want."
"She never was."
"I'm going to do you a favor."
"Do you know what I am?"
"That's what I'm asking."
"Did you have a good night?"
"It's a family thing."
"What's your real name?"
"I need a few minutes."
"I told them the truth."
"Where did you spend the night?"
"What's behind it?"
"I was going to say the same thing."
"A tea, please."
"It was a car accident."
"What is it then?"
"How are things at school?"
"I feel like I'm dreaming."
"You said you loved me."
"I have a job interview."
"I believe it is possible."
"I will do what I want."
"That's what matters, right?"
"I want to be there for you."
"Exactly what I said."
"It's on every channel."
"This is what we expected."
"Watch where you put your feet."
"I never had it."
"Maybe he's telling the truth."
"It's true, I swear."
"I don't think so either."
"Your face looks familiar."
"What happened to the others?"
"You must have heard about it."
"I hope I'm not disturbing you."
"I got him on the phone."
"I want to stay here with you."
"I want to play a game."
"Don't take your eyes off her."
"She hasn't come home yet."
"You have my word of honor."
"That must mean something."
"But I have good news."
"You have nothing else?"
"Is this really a good idea?"
"I have no parents."
"I'll tell you what to do."
"You say that every time."
"You know what pisses me off?"
"It's just a detail."
"Show what you can do."
"She's a friend of mine."
"Is it about money?"
"I'll refresh your memory."
"I have a much better idea."
"I am speaking."
"She's the cleaning lady."
"Did anyone see anything?"
"You should be in the hospital."
"I need you now."
"I didn't ask for this."
"I'll stay a little longer."
"What I just said."
"What color are my eyes?"
"You can still change your mind."
"Not from my point of view."
"You should have seen your face."
"I love someone else."
"That's what it seemed to me."
"It was worth the wait."
"I have to ask you some questions."
"I saw it first."
"I sent him home."
"Do you think you're better than me?"
"I had a good teacher."
"Let me explain something to you."
"I do what is right."
"I only have a few minutes."
"You know what you're saying?"
"I've seen that look before."
"Where did you find all this?"
"I am the one who is."
"She never spoke about it."
"How are we going to get out of this?"
"About a year ago."
"That's totally you."
"Maybe or maybe not."
"Look at the state you are in."
"It's you they want."
"I'm really lucky."
"I touched a nerve."
"We can't hide anything from you."
"I have a letter for you."
"But there is something."
"And what is it about?"
"I'm done with him."
"That's love."
"About a month ago."
"It will take a little time."
"What else did you see?"
"Is this where you live?"
"No, I cannot accept."
"How can you tell me that?"
"We did a good job."
"I want it to be perfect."
"What are we drinking?"
"No, it can't wait."
"It only happened once."
"You have to move on."
"It's good to hear from you."
"What do you think about all this?"
"I experienced the same thing."
"I'm putting out a search notice."
"See what you can find."
"It'll be better in a minute."
"I was very lucky."
"We were just having fun."
"It all depends on the point of view."
"You have to take care of yourself."
"But why did you do that?"
"May I approach the witness?"
"She reminds me of you."
"I was looking forward to meeting you."
"I need a driver."
"There are children here."
"It has always been this way."
"Do you know how much I love you?"
"What will it change?"
"It's at the end of the corridor."
"What if we get caught?"
"I wanted to show you something."
"I'll get you something to drink."
"We'll be here for a while."
"I inquired about you."
"I wonder where she is."
"Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen."
"He never had one."
"What are you doing in my house?"
"It's up to her to decide."
"Do what I ask."
"I think it's there."
"It's two o'clock in the morning."
"She has no one else."
"You can't go anywhere."
"Let's see what's there."
"What does he like?"
"He asked me to come."
"I didn't tell them."
"And then there's this."
"I owe him money."
"We'll do that another time."
"Here's what happened."
"What about me?"
"Do you know what it's called?"
"I'm taking him to the hospital."
"I don't drink beer."
"You don't know anything about her."
"What do you know about this?"
"I'll be a few minutes."
"It's time to wake up."
"Who gave you the order?"
"Everyone has secrets."
"You are on private property."
"Are you a friend of his?"
"No, I'm not angry."
"I never said it."
"Did she tell you about me?"
"I know what he's thinking."
"What will happen to them?"
"Sorry to have scared you."
"Do you know who you are talking to?"
"That's what we believe."
"No, I didn't hear anything."
"No, I don't know her."
"Is that you doing this?"
"What's happening to her?"
"You should rest a little."
"I didn't say yes."
"Tell him I'm fine."
"I knew it was him."
"Because I care about you."
"I know how I feel."
"They are not soldiers."
"Maybe it's a trick."
"I know what you are looking for."
"I have never met them."
"Everything is changing."
"Of course I have it."
"Whether you like it or not."
"I don't know anything about him."
"Will it work?"
"It's up to him to decide."
"But he's not there anymore."
"My feet are like jelly."
"Would you like to join me?"
"They could be anywhere."
"I knew you would do that."
"What if they don't come?"
"You shouldn't either."
"You have what you want."
"Do you remember this place?"
"There is something in it."
"I want to make this clear."
"I think you were right."
"I didn't even think about it."
"It's up to us to play."
"It's been over a week."
"Do you have somewhere to go?"
"Do you know what he's talking about?"
"If you're lucky."
"They started it."
"He did a good job."
"No, no, I can't."
"I am eating."
"I need your support."
"I think I'll stay."
"I want it to be you."
"There must be one."
"I thought it was obvious."
"I sent her home."
"Thank you for taking the time."
"Have you heard of him?"
"I am one of them."
"I can't swallow anything anymore."
"And I'll tell you why."
"What exactly is it?"
"It should have been said earlier."
"You will get what you want."
"You will have what you want."
"They are more numerous than us."
"You are on the right track."
"It was nice meeting you."
"I have something better."
"I want to talk to my daughter."
"It's a workplace."
"I want what you want."
"It can only be him."
"I just need rest."
"It was good to see you again."
"They have the right to know."
"Anything I should know?"
"I spoke to him on the phone."
"He's the one you want."
"There must be someone."
"Do you want me to open it?"
"Maybe it's not him."
"No, I don't remember."
"Like I told you."
"This was just the beginning."
"I am the Hand of the King."
"There is always a chance."
"I told you yesterday."
"She is not herself."
"He knows what I'm talking about."
"I have some very good news."
"And what did you tell him?"
"I'll get you one."
"But I need time."
"It's just for fun."
"I'm ready to do it."
"There is plenty of room."
"She's the one I want."
"Let me refresh your memory."
"She didn't do that."
"Do you know what they do?"
"Whose idea was this?"
"We might have something."
"She didn't talk about it."
"Were you asked for your opinion?"
"She's always been like this."
"Don't lecture me."
"I'm proud of you, son."
"I don't play that game."
"I made you a promise."
"I have a message for him."
"Look what you've become."
"I need to hear it."
"I asked her to marry me."
"You have to tell me the truth."
"I understand your point of view."
"That's what he believed."
"What is she wearing?"
"I know you're busy."
"We have some things to sort out."
"We can still turn around."
"You better be careful."
"You can spend the night here."
"They know I'm here."
"I know a little about it."
"Do you remember when we met?"
"It's up to you to tell us."
"I'll be here when you come back."
"When the hens have teeth."
"It's a war zone."
"There never will be."
"I just heard the news."
"I want to say goodbye to him."
"He said he would come."
"I'll be two seconds."
"It is a work of art."
"That's all to your credit."
"I thought the same thing."
"What amuses you?"
"I cut my finger."
"Would you like a cup of coffee?"
"It is against the law."
"No, we don't have any."
"Do you know who I'm talking about?"
"Isn't that the case?"
"You never said anything."
"I need to concentrate."
"I think it will work."
"You know what I would do?"
"How was your night?"
"Maybe it's fate."
"It has to be you."
"I didn't call him."
"I want us to get married."
"I am a man of God."
"My mother told me."
"What do we look like?"
"Okay, I'm done."
"Eat while it's hot."
"I had never felt like this."
"Of course I'm here."
"What happened happened."
"That's what I wish."
"I never thought that."
"Can we see each other later?"
"He reminds me of you."
"What is he looking at?"
"Because he's my brother."
"What are you doing here so late?"
"Is that what you do?"
"I want to give you something."
"May his soul rest in peace."
"He suspects something."
"I know you're hungry."
"I know you're here."
"I'll look for some more."
"I have more important things to do."
"I wanted to know how you were doing."
"You are not up to it."
"There is a third option."
"This is an ongoing investigation."
"It's time for medication."
"I see it every day."
"It's a rescue mission."
"That's the difference between us."
"Do you know about this?"
"My legs are like cotton."
"Do you know who said that?"
"She's not yours."
"Two beers, please."
"No, you don't know him."
"What am I being accused of?"
"I like that in a woman."
"It's a wedding gift."
"It's a rite of passage."
"It's a phone number."
"I want you to have this."
"Will it last long?"
"I just wanted to make sure."
"I'll make things easier for you."
"You must leave right away."
"Tell me what you're thinking."
"I want to know where he is."
"And this is for you."
"I think it is necessary."
"It took me a while."
"I will be as silent as a grave."
"I left you three messages."
"We do this all the time."
"She never did."
"I slept with someone."
"It's like you said."
"I love you too, my darling."
"Of course you know that."
"Leave him out of it."
"I had something to do."
"Honey, what's going on?"
"What are you running from?"
"They didn't say it."
"You are one of them."
"I just arrived in town."
"What about you?"
"Do you understand what's going on?"
"I must be able to do something."
"You know what's coming."
"It's better for both of us."
"We are so proud of you."
"This is just a guess."
"It's exactly the same thing."
"This better be good."
"You need to listen to me."
"Guess what I found."
"This is a gift for you."
"At the point I'm at."
"Can I offer you some tea?"
"What's holding him back?"
"It's an engagement ring."
"I already told you no."
"Everyone is talking about you."
"You should have come to see me."
"We have a big day tomorrow."
"I saw her first."
"Have you spoken to your father?"
"Don't pay attention to them."
"Please let it pass."
"And what happens?"
"I know what to expect."
"I had a lot of work."
"Can I sit with you?"
"You know what you want."
"That's where he is."
"What do you mean, you don't know?"
"And what did he answer?"
"That was nice of you."
"Someone is in a good mood."
"We'll talk about it at home."
"I have to go see someone."
"Call me as soon as you can."
"It's a guy thing."
"Where is she right now?"
"I had never heard that."
"He does what he can."
"He is absolutely right."
"I have a big day tomorrow."
"You did it for yourself."
"Look after each other."
"We have something for you."
"There were a lot of people."
"I will never do it again."
"I'll show you how to do it."
"The police, please."
"No, you don't know that."
"I only have one question."
"She didn't mean that."
"It started to rain."
"No one has ever seen him."
"Let's see what's going on."
"You are a very beautiful woman."
"Thank you for telling me about it."
"I don't know the answer."
"This is completely understandable."
"I relieve you of your duties."
"I don't have a sister."
"I have something else in mind."
"He knows what he wants."
"You're right on time."
"I'm going to brush my teeth."
"You don't need to know."
"I want you to see it."
"I bit my tongue."
"Come on, I'll show you around."
"If we're lucky."
"I hadn't seen her."
"I can tell you one thing."
"I hope they are well."
"It was God's will."
"Do you have a statement to make?"
"I know he is."
"Your mother told me."
"What is he wearing?"
"I'm glad to hear from you."
"Do you know what this means?"
"She's not with you?"
"I guess that's it."
"I got shot."
"Is that what you're saying?"
"Have you ever tried our sausages?"
"Please, talk to me."
"Anywhere, anytime."
"And I love you for that."
"I want to talk to my brother."
"Isn't that right, guys?"
"Love one another."
"Yes, there is something."
"Nobody cared."
"We made the right choice."
"It's a madhouse."
"Maybe I'll go."
"It's for everyone."
"We'll clear this up."
"I slept on the couch."
"I saw you with him."
"I will never let you go."
"You wouldn't have a cigarette?"
"He needs his mother."
"It's a gift from heaven."
"I wrote you a song."
"Where have you been all day?"
"Did you see who's here?"
"Do you see what it is?"
"I have to go to church."
"I don't have time right now."
"I'll make you something."
"I thought everything was fine."
"I should never have come."
"I thought I told you."
"Would you like to do me a favor?"
"I have to move on."
"I grew up in this house."
"Do you have anything else to say?"
"I'm out of bullets."
"You don't know anything about him."
"I want him to be happy."
"I'll explain everything to you later."
"I can't read this."
"I knew I would find you."
"You weren't even there."
"We're here to have fun."
"The Dutchman must have a captain."
"I am stronger than you."
"What, you don't believe me?"
"Did he do something to you?"
"It helps me focus."
"I am one of your admirers."
"I thought you left."
"I always have it with me."
"I told you to get out."
"I told you to get out of here."
"No, she didn't say anything."
"I'll let you rest."
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
"Did you have a good time?"
"Can I see you for a moment?"
"I know exactly where he is."
"What motivates you?"
"I wish you a pleasant stay."
"No, you don't."
"I thought I heard voices."
"I know what they're doing."
"You're the one I was looking for."
"I need a bath."
"It's been over a year."
"There is always a reason."
"That's where I was."
"Glad you liked it."
"I found another one."
"I'll get another one."
"I think it's here."
"Of course I believe you."
"That's what you were saying."
"What if you can't?"
"He did his best."
"I need a hug."
"Maybe you'll change your mind."
"I will give you an example."
"You want me to be honest?"
"There's a price on your head."
"Of course it is possible."
"I have a family to support."
"They did something to him."
"I feel good with you."
"Ask someone else."
"It's a Christmas miracle."
"And my brother lives with them."
"He is on a business trip."
"Don't ask me questions."
"But I have another idea."
"Don't go away from me."
"Look what I have here."
"I would like to talk to you for a moment."
"I hope you find it."
"I know how to take care of myself."
"She does this all the time."
"I spoke to him last night."
"Have you ever been told?"
"Are you listening to what I'm saying?"
"I know what he's doing."
"What is he writing?"
"It's good to hear that."
"We can see it like this."
"You can see it like this."
"What if we can't?"
"I did well to come."
"I prepared something for you."
"You can join us."
"I have always been with you."
"I can't think anymore."
"What does he believe?"
"Do you know what it's for?"
"Finish what you started."
"I'm going to get myself a beer."
"I want to talk to my husband."
"I only have a minute."
"I don't have to answer."
"It's our wedding anniversary."
"What happens then?"
"Of course I forgive you."
"Thank you all for being here."
"I want you to forgive me."
"Was that a gunshot?"
"You don't want to do it?"
"Do you know what I have?"
"Thank you for doing this for me."
"I want to talk to my son."
"And how did it go?"
"We've known each other for years."
"Can I take a look at it?"
"You just have to trust me."
"She did her best."
"I'm the one doing it."
"I spoke to your father."
"I want to know everything about him."
"And what am I supposed to do?"
"She never loved me."
"I'll settle the score with him."
"No, that's a good idea."
"I read it in your eyes."
"You have to do better than that."
"Everything looks in order."
"Do you know what I think?"
"She seems very nice."
"I am a businesswoman."
"I would like to tell you something."
"What's plan B?"
"We've seen others."
"This is your moment to shine."
"From one day to the next."
"I am not a boy."
"This might be a clue."
"This is the password."
"You need to talk to me."
"I'd like to show you something."
"I answered your question."
"Please don't leave."
"I was raised like that."
"Let me tell you a story."
"I have a mission to accomplish."
"I've had it for years."
"Do I need a lawyer?"
"I think it worked."
"That's absolutely right."
"You were very lucky."
"I thought you loved him."
"What am I writing?"
"I'm just a woman."
"I already told you about it."
"Is this what you were looking for?"
"It's cool to see you."
"You have to get me out of here."
"I had a good life."
"Fuck her."
"I should have thought of that before."
"I'll be here when you wake up."
"Do you want to go to the hospital?"
"What is better?"
"You can be proud of yourself."
"I tried to protect you."
"I have nothing against him."
"Yes, I remember him."
"She looks in good shape."
"I'll take care of that one."
"There's one there."
"Your mother would be proud of you."
"I never touched her."
"I'll make you some tea."
"He did it himself."
"Tell me a little about yourself."
"Maybe that's a good sign."
"Have you started drinking again?"
"They look so happy."
"He sent me."
"It was my grandmother's."
"May the Lord be with you."
"I hope that's clear."
"She's one of us."
"Do you think I enjoy this?"
"You didn't even look."
"We've known each other for a while."
"I will never have children."
"I know how she feels."
"I took something from you."
"It's a little further."
"Everyone wants something."
"Thank you for seeing me so quickly."
"I always wanted a daughter."
"You need to wake up."
"You were just a child."
"I think I'll leave."
"But he wasn't."
"I want you to see this."
"His face looks familiar."
"But what is it about?"
"What if you came with me?"
"Look what we found."
"There is a price on my head."
"Give her what she wants."
"It wasn't a suggestion."
"I knew you were there."
"Do you know where she went?"
"Where have I heard that before?"
"I knew you would find me."
"Tell us what you want."
"Can we ask you some questions?"
"It's rare, but it happens."
"What exactly did she say?"
"I've got the hang of it."
"Nobody wants you here."
"The number, please."
"You can't hide."
"Oh, it's a long story."
"How are we going to get out of here?"
"Have you ever kissed a girl?"
"I'm here, I'm staying."
"I say this for your own good."
"No, but I will."
"I don't know, we'll see."
"You knew it from the start."
"Everyone has a choice."
"But I don't."
"He gets what he deserves."
"I need to do it."
"He is as gentle as a lamb."
"I had never heard of it."
"I saw him in a dream."
"I know she's here."
"I didn't invite him."
"I have little time left."
"You just have to ask him."
"I saw this on the news."
"No, it wasn't him."
"Please hurry."
"I want you to marry me."
"I had the right to know."
"How could I do this?"
"Because I saw it."
"I know what he looks like."
"As if you didn't know."
"We do it all the time."
"It's a courtesy visit."
"Where did you get all this from?"
"I'm glad you called."
"Do you really want to do this now?"
"It's a witch hunt."
"That's the point of the game."
"Did you do something to him?"
"I needed to hear that."
"What you just said."
"I have a reputation to uphold."
"You don't think I can do it?"
"I don't have that impression."
"I have to go to a meeting."
"It's black magic."
"It's always the same with you."
"I have someone to see."
"Do you know what you have?"
"Do you know what he says?"
"Nothing is known about him."
"I believe this belongs to you."
"You'll have to trust me."
"I have no desire to do so."
"What kind of work do you do?"
"I did the same thing."
"It's time for that to change."
"She shouldn't be here."
"Take back what you said."
"The facts speak for themselves."
"The keys are in the ignition."
"Sorry it was so long."
"Were you expecting someone else?"
"I am so happy for you."
"This was not the case."
"Why did you bring him here?"
"See you at the party."
"She didn't tell you?"
"There is no hope."
"I still have a lot to learn."
"No, I'll take a taxi."
"How did I get out of it?"
"This is very good work."
"You can leave whenever you want."
"I wanted to say goodbye to him."
"No point in talking about it."
"That's what I like to hear."
"I think he's fine."
"Maybe not so much."
"You already asked me."
"Of course it's him."
"You need to get up."
"What have you gotten yourself into?"
"Do you want to know who I am?"
"I understood the first time."
"He just told me."
"Enjoy it while it lasts."
"I'll meet you at the car."
"You didn't find it?"
"I think it's going to rain."
"He only thinks about that."
"I didn't ask for it."
"Tell him I'll call him back."
"But that's a good thing."
"I see this all the time."
"There is so much to say."
"Could you lower your voice?"
"I wanted to apologize for yesterday."
"I love you, that's all."
"I just knew it."
"Do you want to go see a movie?"
"What are we doing?"
"This is the will of Allah."
"We'll take care of them."
"You hit the nail on the head."
"I shook his hand."
"And I'm proud of you."
"Do you want to enter this program?"
"I had a wonderful dream."
"You don't know who it is?"
"One room, please."
"I appreciate what you do."
"I have something planned."
"I know I love you."
"What were you looking at?"
"Leave while you can."
"You didn't talk to him?"
"I want to talk to my mother."
"I want you to keep it."
"You should go to the hospital."
"I can do that for you."
"Take your torches and return to camp."
"I'll have a word with him."
"I made him a promise."
"This is my reason for being."
"He's somewhere around there."
"What about the others?"
"This is my birthday present."
"I think I know who it is."
"I know what you like."
"How long do you plan to stay?"
"You are really lucky."
"I've done it before."
"What tempts you?"
"It's just money."
"It's a lifestyle."
"I know what she wants."
"They told him about a light."
"You look very beautiful tonight."
"Compliments of the house."
"I give you five out of five."
"A time machine."
"Can you tell me more?"
"I drove all night."
"That's what he thinks."
"You better be right."
"What worked?"
"I wish you a good evening."
"There must be an exit."
"I think it's her."
"I understand what's going on."
"He's my bodyguard."
"It's going to be okay, I'm here."
"I need both of you."
"Do you want me to take it?"
"Everyone can see it."
"This is friendly advice."
"I knew he would."
"That's what we were saying."
"I'll let you in on a secret."
"I want to get this over with."
"Let me do this for you."
"It's breathtaking."
"I have some information for you."
"Okay, I've got you."
"When will the ships be ready?"
"It's time to pay."
"That's what he's looking for."
"Do you know why we're here?"
"I made the right decision."
"Can I call you later?"
"Can't you say it?"
"And you, what is your name?"
"I'll buy you another one."
"I wrote it for you."
"But you weren't there."
"We have unfinished business."
"Who told you about me?"
"Oh, that's a good idea."
"I made friends."
"You didn't tell them?"
"It opened my eyes."
"It had to happen sooner or later."
"I'm going to teach you a lesson."
"When are we going home?"
"Captain, what's going on?"
"What do you have to gain?"
"He says he loves me."
"I'm going to go get some fresh air."
"We can't go anywhere."
"No one has ever done it."
"I told you to come home."
"How's it going in there?"
"No, no, no, it's fine."
"What can I do for you, sir?"
"Please believe me."
"I need to see her."
"Do you think this is true?"
"Who gave you this number?"
"I bought it for you."
"They knew what they were doing."
"I just wanted to talk to you about that."
"You don't want to say it?"
"I need more men."
"Get out or I'll call the police."
"I wrote you a letter."
"Give us a hand."
"It's rush hour."
"How about we go for a walk?"
"There is always someone."
"You are relieved of your duties."
"I told you yes."
"I don't speak your language."
"Do you know where they went?"
"Have you never thought about it?"
"What will I do without you?"
"That makes at least one."
"Do you want to go get a coffee?"
"I've been in your shoes."
"And what happened to him?"
"I am pleased to meet you."
"Don't try to fool me."
"You have to enjoy life."
"When were you planning to tell me?"
"Do you want to go with me?"
"I feel it in my gut."
"You know what I'm saying?"
"You no longer have a choice."
"We will do what we can."
"It goes further than that."
"Have I not been clear?"
"She is in all her states."
"Explain to me what's going on."
"No, I don't do that."
"I know what you were thinking."
"She knows what she's talking about."
"Are you from the same family?"
"That's totally him."
"Talk to me, please."
"Of course I'm sure."
"I love you, you know that?"
"You can never have enough."
"The back door was open."
"Okay, I found it."
"It's a business trip."
"He was there just now."
"Can't you go any faster?"
"It's all right, it's over."
"It's time for gifts."
"It's not up to you."
"He is a man of his word."
"I'll make it easy for you."
"I'm needed here."
"Do as I said."
"You weren't yourself."
"I do this every day."
"I never knew why."
"Tell them I love them."
"I had an incredible dream."
"The bathroom is there."
"I need to talk to my husband."
"I started it."
"It's a rental car."
"What would I have done without you?"
"I had that dream again."
"Show me your ID card."
"I think I should go home."
"No, it's not important."
"I need to talk to my father."
"I think it's important."
"Okay, what's going on?"
"I go there all the time."
"I would have done anything."
"It looks delicious to me."
"You haven't read it?"
"I am working."
"I didn't invite her."
"It's not luck."
"I've always wondered that."
"Do you have some time?"
"Yes, you already said that."
"I'm going to stay here for a while."
"Everyone loves heroes."
"I don't want tea."
"You have to tell him the truth."
"I have friends in high places."
"Who hasn't?"
"Do you have someone in mind?"
"I know what they want."
"I have what you wanted."
"Who knows what might happen?"
"That's where we come in."
"You're just like everyone else."
"I keep calling you."
"You know what I have?"
"Yes, it looks good."
"I left the door open."
"Tell him I called."
"What if it's a boy?"
"I'm not a girl."
"It's a secret between us."
"Take a look around you."
"Someone has to do something."
"What am I forgetting?"
"Maybe it's something else."
"Chance does things well."
"Give them what they want."
"That's really kind of you."
"I told you about her."
"I'm winning."
"I know this from a reliable source."
"I told you to wait."
"I was born in space."
"She's not a child anymore."
"Do you want to ask me something?"
"No, I wasn't."
"You better believe it."
"Not long ago."
"Its place is in a museum."
"I went to a good school."
"It doesn't hurt to ask."
"What kind of person are you?"
"No, not in the least."
"He asked you a question."
"I just got to the hospital."
"What is all this stuff?"
"It's part of life."
"I'll take care of the door."
"Where do you want me to be?"
"I like what I see."
"Let's go for a drive."
"I've seen this movie before."
"What are you doing in my office?"
"This is the house of God."
"It's my way of being."
"Turn around, please."
"I read it somewhere."
"Tell me how you feel."
"What's your hurry?"
"I knocked on the door."
"I have eyes to see."
"It is a gift from God."
"Look what happened."
"She has no friends."
"Just what I needed."
"I need your phone."
"I have one thing to do."
"You can be whoever you want."
"I come here all the time."
"Is there another way?"
"Everything has to start somewhere."
"I waited all day."
"I need a few days."
"I've been looking into you."
"I see what you're talking about."
"I remember one thing."
"We are the same, you and I."
"All I need."
"Because I need it."
"It's all to his credit."
"It happened to me once."
"You're right, it's true."
"Can I get you anything else?"
"This is how it happened."
"She's doing very well."
"He wants her name."
"No, I'm not ready."
"I am free as a bird."
"I realize it now."
"I thought I saw someone."
"Tell him I'm here."
"I made you a sandwich."
"So, did it go well?"
"I'm not sleeping with him."
"I saw it myself."
"I have patients to see."
"Take all you can."
"I did it for her."
"No, that doesn't make any sense."
"Don't involve her in this."
"I'll give you something."
"I have to go to the bank."
"I only speak the truth."
"It was nice talking to you."
"You have a very nice house."
"I need you to come."
"That's what I would say."
"It was a set-up."
"I've known him for years."
"Go ahead, I'll take care of it."
"He needs a father."
"I realize that."
"Please be quiet."
"If you need anything, call me."
"Go see what it is."
"In fact, it is."
"Guys, guys, guys."
"You have no authority here."
"Let's not jump to conclusions."
"Have you spoken to anyone?"
"Did it make you feel better?"
"I invited her to dinner."
"What do you have to tell us?"
"Did you tell mom?"
"No, I don't want that."
"What you told me."
"Show me what you're worth."
"That's what I hear."
"You should be proud of him."
"Did you do this for me?"
"You need someone."
"He was inspired by you."
"No, it didn't work."
"He will be here in an hour."
"You know her better than I do."
"Of course I have some."
"Move over, please."
"Do you know what she does?"
"I would be very grateful."
"Because he's my friend."
"I called you several times."
"This is a very generous offer."
"It's just a car."
"I hope we meet again."
"My father is in the hospital."
"Everything went very well."
"See you in a minute."
"I got what I wanted."
"Is everything ready?"
"He's doing very well."
"That's what we'll do."
"I don't want his shoes."
"Didn't anyone tell you?"
"Do you want to go have a drink?"
"I thought it was him."
"I'll make you some eggs."
"I'll tell the others."
"What does she like?"
"I should have done something."
"Look at me, please."
"You did everything you could."
"What will we call it?"
"Don't say it like that."
"This is the dimension of imagination."
"I know it's important."
"Did you do it yourself?"
"I want justice to be done."
"The world is coming to an end."
"He is a very kind man."
"I spread the word."
"The government has a secret device."
"Listen to what I'm telling you."
"It could be anywhere."
"Someone knocks at the door."
"Yes, you may be right."
"You were right all along."
"Thank you for not saying anything."
"I thought that was clear."
"What did you do with the body?"
"For saving my life."
"Is it that simple?"
"You don't know it yet."
"Did you know I was here?"
"I said the same thing."
"It's up to him."
"I think she's here."
"I'll be there as soon as possible."
"They are friends of mine."
"That was nice of him."
"I will do my best, sir."
"It has your name on it."
"I apologize for all of this."
"There is absolutely nothing."
"I'll call you when I get back."
"I want to know where they are."
"No one has seen him since."
"For what I did."
"I'll get you a towel."
"You have to be strong."
"I thought about all this."
"You do what I say."
"You were right about me."
"It's a very beautiful place."
"While there is still time."
"I'll walk you to the door."
"Have you tried calling him?"
"I want to take care of you."
"Someone shot him."
"What is normal?"
"I've got my eye on him."
"I have something for her."
"Did you think I forgot?"
"You have a package for me."
"No, you shouldn't have."
"You should ask her out."
"I never said anything."
"It would be the first time."
"They didn't tell you anything?"
"What would you like me to do?"
"I'll see how he is."
"What is truth?"
"How can you be so calm?"
"We have to go to the airport."
"Looks like it's over."
"I was hoping you would know."
"Is that clear enough for you?"
"From one moment to the next."
"He never said that."
"You should be home."
"There is a good chance."
"Is that what you thought?"
"I know, I saw it."
"Repeat what you said."
"It's going to take some time."
"I found this on the ground."
"I need a new assistant."
"Tell me something nice."
"You will be more comfortable."
"Are you homesick?"
"Have I ever let you down?"
"I asked him to leave."
"I'll gouge your eyes out."
"No, they won't."
"That's what I say about it."
"You can leave if you want."
"I'll meet you inside."
"Everything seems to be going well."
"This stays between you and me."
"This is what he said."
"Did you go through my things?"
"I have a story for you."
"I don't dare think about it."
"I see this every day."
"Look what we have here."
"What do they believe?"
"What do you risk?"
"I think I am."
"I did something to you."
"I won't say anything more."
"It is a sign from God."
"Who asked your opinion?"
"I had a great day."
"Take what you need."
"I have to go see."
"Not now, please."
"You've never seen her?"
"I need some ice."
"What will happen then?"
"I need a loan."
"He's stubborn."
"I think I got it."
"I don't read newspapers."
"No, I have no idea."
"What is he singing?"
"After what you did?"
"It's time to find out."
"Maybe that's just as well."
"What are you going to do with them?"
"I hope you're telling the truth."
"I hope you are telling the truth."
"Is he the one who sent you?"
"Do you know what's happening to me?"
"Two heads are better than one."
"It's a dream come true."
"Do you see what I'm doing?"
"When did he say that?"
"We have to separate."
"I have to do it alone."
"I'll never tell you."
"This is all new to me."
"And you're telling me that now?"
"She needs her mother."
"I still need you."
"I know you are friends."
"Why did you do this to us?"
"You've made a lot of progress."
"It'll only take a minute."
"I have to go all the way."
"We are very proud of you."
"I prefer to do it myself."
"It's been a long night."
"You don't want me anymore?"
"What do I smell?"
"Look what I bought."
"Because you are my son."
"I'm not going to start now."
"I'm the one who buys it."
"Thank you for giving me a chance."
"About a week ago."
"You don't trust me anymore?"
"No, I don't feel it."
"I got ahead."
"Do you know why I'm stopping you?"
"Is this a date?"
"We'll meet at the hotel."
"She left me a message."
"They are no longer children."
"What's all this for?"
"I know what awaits me."
"You remind me of him."
"Take it, please."
"Thank you for bringing me here."
"I think I have everything."
"I am so proud of you."
"This is your birthday present."
"He told me something."
"I know you'll make it."
"It's much better this way."
"I didn't find any."
"Have you ever thought about that?"
"I had another dream."
"It's a birthday present."
"I saw you on the news."
"You should be proud of yourself."
"Just what I need."
"This is the last time, I promise."
"Thank you for keeping me company."
"You will know in due time."
"I hope this helps you."
"I saw it on the news."
"You don't want to marry me?"
"And that's fine."
"What did I think?"
"If you haven't already."
"What's different?"
"Yes, I realize that."
"Are we not men?"
"No, it's not like that."
"Is that what you would do?"
"There is one here."
"She didn't tell me."
"I am reading."
"It's worth checking out."
"I need to talk to your father."
"I don't say anything at all."
"Look what happened to him."
"You just told me."
"What is it worth?"
"Your license, please."
"I went to the hospital."
"Do you know who I saw?"
"We've known each other since childhood."
"I just received a call."
"Because I know things."
"I will give you money."
"There is a lot of work."
"What are we making?"
"Because I don't know."
"And what do you expect from me?"
"I'm going to take a little walk."
"Do you know where he is now?"
"I'd better go home."
"I haven't started yet."
"You are stronger than that."
"Sorry I doubted you."
"I think everything will be fine."
"I swear on my head."
"I took care of him."
"That's what they wanted."
"Is that fair?"
"But there is a price."
"One for all, all for one."
"It's really not my day."
"I can and I will."
"Is your husband at home?"
"How can I help you?"
"I think I see it."
"I can't do anything for him."
"I'll have him call you back."
"This is the end of everything."
"That's a lot to take in at once."
"It's somewhere around there."
"I'm going to give you a present."
"I took care of her."
"I'd better go see."
"I have a present for you."
"I have to tell him the truth."
"I already have an appointment."
"It looks like someone else."
"I said anything."
"I tried to explain to him."
"I was wondering how you were doing."
"You're not ready yet."
"But it's important to me."
"What's holding us back?"
"You don't have any friends?"
"You should be in school."
"It's locked from the inside."
"That's all that's true."
"And how do we go about it?"
"Would you like to go out with me?"
"Can't we go any faster?"
"I have a package for you."
"Maybe she's right."
"If I'm lucky."
"But what if it is?"
"It was my grandfather's."
"I think I did it."
"I need a job."
"The restroom, please?"
"I brought you some clothes."
"I knew we would make it."
"You are taller than me."
"Are you surprised to see me?"
"I wanted to talk to you."
"I'm going to get myself a soda."
"And I never will be."
"Who told you my name?"
"I'll teach him a lesson."
"It scares me a little."
"You don't have time anymore."
"I can't handle this."
"I asked myself the question."
"It's good for morale."
"It's more than a coincidence."
"We heard about you."
"Do you remember Miss Simms?"
"She has to go to the hospital."
"You have until dawn."
"What's special about it?"
"This is a very good thing."
"What are you bringing back?"
"And you let him do it?"
"They are not men."
"The future of rock 'n' roll."
"I need to get dressed."
"I can't allow this."
"I did it all by myself."
"We must stick together."
"Can you do it for me?"
"He's one of the weirdos."
"Do you know what you're saying?"
"Thank you for coming tonight."
"I'm the one who invites you."
"I wanted to ask you a question."
"It's going to take me some time."
"I think we've got it."
"I think I messed up."
"We have other things to do."
"I know you have it."
"A rock sees better than him."
"You have other things to do."
"What is real?"
"Do you want us to walk you home?"
"I'm glad to meet you."
"Did you do it for me?"
"It's wonderful to see you."
"We will do whatever you want."
"You've never been there."
"That's totally me."
"There's nothing you can do for him."
"We must go all the way."
"Tell us what's going on."
"I didn't listen to him."
"Sorry for scaring you."
"What do you want to do tonight?"
"I want you by my side."
"You see what I'm saying?"
"I'm starting to get used to it."
"It feels good to get out."
"Man's best friend."
"This is for your own safety."
"This is the best thing to do."
"The name rings a bell."
"And what's that for?"
"How long will this last?"
"I might have one."
"I did it twice."
"Did you say goodbye to him?"
"I've heard that name before."
"I didn't see it."
"I only think of her."
"If you take it like that."
"It's a play."
"I am dreaming."
"That's what interests me."
"See you later, then."
"I made a copy of it."
"Is she the one who sent you?"
"I think it's done."
"I'm going to cook for you."
"I ask you to marry me."
"It's rare these days."
"Well, I have to go."
"I was kind of expecting it."
"I'll talk to my wife about it."
"Have you heard about us?"
"Another one, please."
"What happened then?"
"Find the road to Earth."
"Look what he did."
"You want to go to the Island."
"I thought you would say that."
"Mr. Jameson, your online wife."
"It's more serious than that."
"I'm going to introduce you to someone."
"At least, that's my opinion."
"But it's more than that."
"At this point."
"She's not coming with us."
"Not as far as I'm concerned."
"I've been waiting for half an hour."
"There are many reasons."
"Do you think I'm having fun?"
"Your father had a stroke."
"I'm fine the way I am."
"I thought of one thing."
"I have to get it out."
"This might be the right one."
"I want you to talk to me."
"And you know it very well."
"It will be an honor for me."
"I'll be ten minutes."
"I have to go to the pharmacy."
"It will cheer you up."
"I'm out of breath."
"I want to know who you are."
"I asked him the question."
"What color are your eyes?"
"They do what they can."
"How are things down there?"
"This better be important."
"I hope you are having fun."
"How did your interview go?"
"You remember him, right?"
"A lot of things happened."
"I can leave whenever I want."
"Can I have a copy?"
"I had never noticed it."
"Why do you need us?"
"I thought you liked that."
"Maybe they're right."
"Take this, please."
"This is never a good sign."
"Can we have some music?"
"I have some in the car."
"Look where that got me."
"But business is business."
"He took care of me."
"I am not a woman."
"I tried to be nice."
"We both win."
"But we did nothing."
"We haven't found anything yet."
"That's noble of you."
"No, it's better this way."
"It's a way of life."
"I wanted to keep you updated."
"Tell me you forgive me."
"I was taken by surprise."
"Does this name sound familiar to you?"
"I didn't call her."
"I love you too, my son."
"I know everything will be okay."
"I should have said something."
"Are you hungover?"
"It's as old as the hills."
"She is giving birth."
"You'll see when we get there."
"It's a very beautiful name."
"I said goodbye to him."
"Did you let him touch you?"
"What do you know about love?"
"I know where the money is."
"I'll start at the beginning."
"Don't come near me anymore."
"Did I ask you something?"
"It's a bribe."
"He will get what he deserves."
"This is our first date."
"You've always been like this."
"Have you heard about this?"
"I'm waiting for a phone call."
"You are very sure of yourself."
"But they are not."
"Do you want to have some fun?"
"What does this imply?"
"I thought about it all night."
"Does this make sense to you?"
"There is just one thing."
"This is my way of doing things."
"There is a woman here."
"That's what they are."
"How long do you need?"
"Someone is at the door."
"I think we are ready."
"What did he talk about?"
"I want what is mine."
"Men are all the same."
"You have little time left."
"It's good quality."
"No further questions, Your Honor."
"As I always have."
"I'm more in the know."
"I was hoping we could talk."
"No, I would never do that."
"This is my workplace."
"You're a good little guy."
"There are only two of us left."
"How could she do that?"
"Call me, please."
"What kind of doctor are you?"
"I will pay whatever it takes."
"He laughed at me."
"But there is one condition."
"What kind of person does that?"
"Everyone is getting involved."
"I can smell it in the air."
"It cost him his life."
"How did the flight go?"
"No one has ever done that."
"See how easy it is?"
"I don't want a woman."
"Please call Central Service."
"After what happened?"
"What does he eat?"
"I'm fine, I assure you."
"Do you have any ID?"
"Do you have something to hide?"
"You have the right to know."
"Can't you tell me?"
"Excuse us, please."
"Where did you learn English?"
"I'm a tough guy."
"Do you want to meet?"
"Tell me what's happening to you."
"How does this happen?"
"You do it all the time."
"Yes, I will take care of it."
"No need to say more."
"Do you want me to introduce you?"
"Is there another woman?"
"How do you know where I live?"
"I always wanted a son."
"No, it can't be."
"Where did he take her?"
"It's one o'clock in the morning."
"Are you sure you're ready?"
"I waited all night."
"How much is there?"
"No one else will."
"God knows I tried."
"Let me see what you've got."
"I'm going to put you to bed."
"What more do you want to know?"
"Thank you for pointing this out to me."
"How did the meeting go?"
"I need a miracle."
"I have some late work."
"You'll only get one chance."
"That's generous of you."
"I told him to wait."
"How did you get my address?"
"He's an FBI agent."
"On your mother's head?"
"I was expecting someone else."
"It's okay, they're gone."
"I thought I'd find you there."
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"Do you think I'm interested?"
"I think we did it."
"You can see it in his eyes."
"I do it every day."
"As you asked me."
"It's nothing extraordinary."
"Have you done any weight training?"
"They have heavy artillery."
"I love them both."
"I do what I do."
"It's me she wants."
"It's not the same at all."
"I know it, I feel it."
"He used you."
"It's closed from the outside."
"Do you know what awaits you?"
"I thought you stopped."
"I promised to protect them."
"You can go there on foot."
"It's my reason for living."
"He'll be here for a while."
"We'll have to take care of it."
"It looks very good."
"Because I decided so."
"There's a lot going on."
"I'm in charge of the police."
"I think we should leave."
"I'm giving a hand."
"I am not the police."
"I won't do that to him."
"I saw her this morning."
"I want you so much."
"I know what you're looking for."
"He's been there for a while."
"I've known it from the beginning."
"I'll make you a sandwich."
"No, that's not my type."
"He must have changed his mind."
"No, it's not enough."
"It is government property."
"You don't want to get married?"
"It was in another life."
"Maybe I have a chance."
"No, I wasn't there."
"For the rest of my life."
"They didn't see it."
"There will be other opportunities."
"I'm going to ask you something."
"Maybe you should go."
"No, it's not my thing."
"She was very lucky."
"Because I did it."
"It's just like I remember."
"I know where the exit is."
"Please keep me updated."
"Can't get enough?"
"You should have told us."
"From one end to the other."
"The one I told you about."
"Of course I knew that."
"The witness may return to his seat."
"It wasn't an argument."
"Because you can't."
"Wait here, please."
"I have to tell you the truth."
"I guess it's me."
"No need to add anything."
"I can tell you now."
"An autograph, please."
"I'm busy at the moment."
"How are things going between you?"
"Who knows I'm here?"
"My father is a noble man."
"Who else is with you?"
"It's good to know."
"I will do whatever it takes."
"I want to surprise him."
"I like that in a man."
"We're going to have fun together."
"One for you, one for me."
"What do I think about what?"
"I'll clear this up."
"Because he's my son."
"Did you see who's there?"
"At the end of the corridor on the right."
"She took me by surprise."
"Do you want some fruit juice?"
"Maybe I should call him."
"What do you know about war?"
"There is still some space left."
"You have done everything possible."
"It's more my age."
"You didn't ask him?"
"I'm just having fun."
"I need you so much."
"I haven't done any."
"I asked myself questions."
"You need to dig a little deeper."
"You are no longer children."
"I can stay if you want."
"I had to make a choice."
"I know how to get out of here."
"I'm at my wit's end."
"I would like to speak to my lawyer."
"I get that from my mother."
"It gets on my nerves."
"I'm so proud of him."
"We have a guest room."
"That seems like a good idea to me."
"No, I want to stay with you."
"She had a miscarriage."
"But it never happened."
"It is very important to us."
"He needs his father."
"The great battle of our time."
"I'll take care of it right away."
"Who gave you my number?"
"No, you don't love me."
"It's safer that way."
"I love him like a brother."
"I came to see how you are."
"She used me."
"Have you spoken to the police?"
"Here is the best of music."
"I did this for us."
"Because I'm a girl?"
"It's a collector's item."
"I want you to go there."
"I have never been in love."
"Driving license and registration document."
"What is it, sir?"
"I feel safe here."
"I did it anyway."
"But it's a good idea."
"Take as many as you want."
"At least, not for me."
"But this time it's different."
"It will be necessary to start again on occasion."
"You can't do anything for him."
"Maybe it was a dream."
"Thank you for the vote of confidence."
"Maybe a little of both."
"How about we talk about something else?"
"She never said it."
"Do you want some orange juice?"
"I'll join you inside."
"Maybe tomorrow, who knows?"
"There are better things to do."
"I hope I live up to it."
"Tea, please."
"This is me with my mother."
"He was just a kid."
"Do you still have much time left?"
"I'm going to get myself a coffee."
"Glad to have you on board."
"You should go see a doctor."
"Those were the days, huh?"
"We are meant to be together."
"I like to dress like a woman."
"You told me to come."
"It's just a comedy."
"She has no name."
"Come here, please."
"Who are you to judge me?"
"Do you remember anything else?"
"I know what he is."
"I take full responsibility for this."
"I want something in return."
"I know it's over."
"Wait for me, please."
"Are you on your period or something?"
"I know where he went."
"What's interesting?"
"What scares you?"
"Do you have a picture of him?"
"It was different back then."
"There has been a change."
"This applies to all of you."
"I have no answers."
"We welcome you five out of five."
"I need you to come back."
"She sent me."
"Please remain seated."
"I'll be here for a few hours."
"I told you to back off."
"Have you never been in love?"
"I never asked him."
"You knew, didn't you?"
"It is an act of war."
"He stepped on a mine."
"Can you give us a moment?"
"We found this on him."
"We'll take care of everything."
"I think everything is ready."
"There are people outside."
"I'm part of the team."
"Can we see this later?"
"He is a very important man."
"This just happened to you."
"Yes, who is speaking?"
"Look in the glove compartment."
"What if I had?"
"Tell them what you know."
"Thank you for accepting my invitation."
"And who told you that?"
"That's all, I swear."
"That's what we hope."
"I didn't need it."
"I wish you a beautiful life."
"No, it's a good thing."
"It's because of her."
"After what he did?"
"It's my turn to play."
"Do you know how it happened?"
"What awaits me?"
"I've been working on it for years."
"I get that from my father."
"It's my lunch time."
"He shot himself."
"I know you were there."
"This is a genius idea."
"Do you know what that represents?"
"I think it can work."
"I thought you were done."
"No, I was just saying that."
"The keys are inside."
"I have things to say."
"We'll see you at home."
"I'll never get out of here."
"I gave you a gift."
"Look at the state I'm in."
"Where did you get all this?"
"I know he loves me."
"Don't you want to know why?"
"Is there another entrance?"
"Do you have family here?"
"I got you a coffee."
"You asked me a question."
"But there is one thing."
"How dare you ask me that?"
"What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
"For now, anyway."
"He said it was fine."
"After the rain comes the good weather."
"No, we're not finished."
"These are just questions."
"I need to speak to him in private."
"I will always be near you."
"Let's see how you do."
"She didn't believe me."
"Where did you get this information from?"
"Here we go, here we go."
"So you haven't learned anything?"
"What's said is said."
"You will get what you pay for."
"That's what it was."
"We don't care about that."
"There's a lot at stake."
"How are things up there?"
"He's the one who has it."
"Thanks, but I have to go."
"I can get us out of here."
"You have something of mine."
"Did someone ask you something?"
"Because you are my friend."
"I thought you would know."
"Made for each other."
"I really want this to work."
"He's a really good guy."
"If it is not the case?"
"It's better than sex."
"I'll tell your mother."
"You can really annoy me."
"It's you who interests me."
"Are you saying that to me?"
"This is the best of the best."
"I thought we were partners."
"Maybe I shouldn't."
"What if he's telling the truth?"
"Hold this, please."
"She belonged to my grandfather."
"Do you agree with me?"
"In the name of the good old days."
"I'm happy to be here."
"See you at rehearsal."
"We can go anywhere."
"Don't blame me."
"Do you want my picture, friend?"
"Like most of us."
"I hope he's right."
"Is anyone down there?"
"He came home."
"I'll walk you back to your car."
"You know what I was doing?"
"What did he say to her?"
"Put your arms around me."
"You are here for a reason."
"I did well."
"Do you know what you want?"
"Take the time you need."
"I'm always on your side."
"You do this all the time."
"I've been waiting my whole life."
"I made breakfast."
"I see it on your face."
"Once is not a custom."
"We have a mission to accomplish."
"How are you going to do this?"
"Oh my God, oh my God."
"I only know how to do that."
"What is important?"
"You haven't thought about it?"
"You have a decision to make."
"I need an opinion."
"You know what's great?"
"These are the rules of the game."
"This is what they are waiting for."
"I've waited for you for so long."
"I hired a private detective."
"So, how did it go?"
"Are you the one doing this?"
"I am one of his friends."
"You haven't seen them?"
"When was it taken?"
"You've never met him?"
"But he's a good guy."
"I don't know who to believe anymore."
"He looks very good."
"I have a gift for her."
"Milk and ice cream?"
"Have you ever seen this girl?"
"I don't know the rules."
"He's here, he's here."
"The floor is given to the defense."
"There's always something."
"We took care of everything."
"I could be anyone."
"Who could do such a thing?"
"Tell me it's true."
"We wanted to surprise you."
"I didn't hear them."
"He is heading north."
"I told him to come home."
"She can't stay here."
"This is what I found."
"What started it?"
"I need two volunteers."
"I remember this case."
"No, she wasn't."
"I already took one."
"Have fun, both of you."
"You're an hour late."
"You can't hide anything from me."
"Bottled by my father."
"Better not to think about it."
"I wanted everything to be perfect."
"What time is our train?"
"At the end of the corridor, on the right."
"I saw you in court."
"I tried to contact you."
"I never asked for that."
"Did you act in a pilot?"
"I know what you would say."
"I'll do better than that."
"This is what you did."
"You see what I was saying?"
"And you, what's your name?"
"Thank you for coming to pick me up."
"What am I waiting for?"
"I had a farm in Africa."
"She is absolutely right."
"Exactly what I need."
"We are all proud of you."
"No, I'm not pregnant."
"We had the best intentions, frankly."
"There are other things."
"You're out of time."
"I remember that day."
"How can you live like this?"
"I will love you all my life."
"She is in the recovery room."
"At the end of the corridor, on the left."
"He knows what I know."
"Do you take me for a rookie?"
"Do you see what he's doing?"
"I hope we stay friends."
"Nothing to do with luck."
"What's really going on?"
"Who is shooting?"
"She wanted to tell me something."
"Anyway, thanks."
"I think it's you."
"I'll go take a look."
"I feel like I do."
"Are you sure you want it?"
"Do you want to stay and have fun?"
"I can't do this right now."
"It's a family jewel."
"I just have a quick question."
"You didn't even try."
"There is always a girl."
"I know you understand me."
"This is the house of the Lord."
"I know what you were doing."
"You are not his father."
"Don't tell Mom."
"We have a score to settle."
"Maybe we can work something out."
"That's more for me."
"Tell me everything is okay."
"It's four o'clock in the morning."
"It's you I'm looking at."
"No one can say otherwise."
"We took different paths."
"I'm going to freshen up a bit."
"There's always something going on."
"I'm trying to make a living."
"You need to know something."
"And you, what did you do?"
"I have a deadline to meet."
"I have to get him out of there."
"You have to see her."
"You have little choice."
"I think I've got it."
"Did you really just say that?"
"It goes straight to my heart."
"Don't order me around."
"He is in the recovery room."
"I've been saying it from the beginning."
"Don't tell your father anything."
"Let's settle this once and for all."
"We might have a lead."
"I feel much better, thank you."
"Of course it's important."
"Look what she did."
"It's a real headache."
"He kicks."
"I spoke to his mother."
"What is your opinion of me?"
"That's nice of them."
"You're the doc, Doc."
"How am I supposed to do this?"
"I'll try to find it."
"You don't have any parents?"
"I was just a child."
"It was no secret."
"I needed someone."
"I have to pull myself together."
"Yes, but for how long?"
"We will see the details later."
"What he says is true."
"At the end of the week."
"What do you plan to do with this?"
"Where have you been all this time?"
"I know where we can go."
"I only found that."
"I have answered your questions."
"Who allowed you in?"
"I know what's been stalking you."
"One Ring to rule them all."
"You don't trust him?"
"I want a child from you."
"I had the same dream."
"Do you have anything to declare?"
"What does that make you think of?"
"They know it's you."
"All this is for you."
"It's time to close."
"You know who I mean?"
"You're going to do me a favor."
"I'll give you something to eat."
"I know that's a lot."
"You knew this was going to happen."
"You are so good to me."
"Because I asked him."
"Want some company?"
"Didn't you hear it?"
"I would like to have a word with you."
"What do you guys say?"
"She's the one who has it."
"I couldn't find anything else."
"I have no opinion."
"I'll have another drink."
"This is what we should do."
"There are other jobs."
"He is what he is."
"I thought she loved me."
"What did you just call me?"
"I thought about her a lot."
"It's holy water."
"That's always something."
"Your role in history continues."
"That will be all for now."
"The fluid passes into his lungs."
"Come on, let's get this over with."
"I'll get you a drink."
"The honeymoon is over."
"There was traffic."
"But no, that's not it."
"He took me by surprise."
"And the rest of the family?"
"It's nice to meet you."
"He may have done it."
"Give me a scene."
"She was just a child."
"Here come the days of the King."
"It's just a memory."
"Take the safest route."
"Can you protect me from you?"
"You're not like that anymore."
"And that's what matters."
"I thought you liked him."
"He grew up on the streets."
"I don't owe you anything anymore."
"Tell him it's important."
"There are tons of them."
"I learned it by heart."
"Do you want me to stay here?"
"The one to whom you owe allegiance."
"Nobody calls me that."
"Think about what you say."
"Did you tell them about me?"
"Maybe this is our chance."
"Where did this happen?"
"There's plenty for two."
"I hope you can make it."
"There is always a choice."
"It's going to be a beautiful day."
"Do you call him by his first name?"
"How long does she have?"
"Faster, please."
"I didn't send it."
"What is he doing on my front page?"
"You've never seen him?"
"I don't have any family anymore."
"What was it like at school?"
"I was hoping you would be there."
"This may be the end."
"I told you my name."
"I'll try to fix that."
"How do you know if it's true?"
"We have so much to say to each other."
"Do you see him in this courtroom?"
"I've been there twice."
"I need to talk to him urgently."
"Forewarned is forearmed."
"You are a man of your word."
"I asked you to leave."
"This is the end of the movie."
"Can you give me your address?"
"I am in a delicate situation."
"You end up getting used to it."
"Do you know who my father is?"
"I've already told you about it."
"Since when has she been like this?"
"I take this very seriously."
"I release you from my service."
"You better not know."
"I always wanted to do it."
"I hope she gets better."
"She says it."
"It's quiet right now."
"It goes both ways."
"She never did that."
"We've come all this way."
"Did you know what was going to happen?"
"You already told me that."
"It's time for me to go home."
"We have to face facts."
"Do you hear what they're saying?"
"This is my wedding present."
"I wanted you to see it."
"I can write you a check."
"I overreacted."
"Nice to have you with us."
"Do you think it will work?"
"I'm willing to believe that."
"Can you point it out to the jurors?"
"It's coffee time."
"There is surely a solution."
"What if I came with you?"
"In my office, right away."
"Thank you for cheering me up."
"Can I get you a beer?"
"I was at the end of my rope."
"What I say is true."
"No, you don't owe me anything."
"I want to talk to you for a moment."
"It was about time you arrived."
"I told them to leave."
"You must not come here."
"But we have the White Magician."
"It's a family reunion."
"Maybe in another life."
"Someone told me."
"This is what I want to hear."
"That's what we will do."
"Thanks for getting me out."
"She never loved you."
"The southern road is monitored."
"Your country needs you."
"Do you want to kiss?"
"I'm aware of that."
"Don't think about that now."
"I think you are."
"How do you say 'friend' in Elvish?"
"I'm the one who's going to speak."
"That's what it's for, folks."
"I've always wanted to."
"Here is what I propose to you."
"I want to talk to my father."
"I had her on the phone."
"It's on my mind too."
"What else do you need?"
"I can get you out of here."
"I know it's early."
"I had a great idea."
"One service is worth another."
"Call me back as soon as you can."
"It's just a photo."
"You have been a good friend."
"Could I have some water?"
"What happened to the baby?"
"You are so much more than that."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"The last pages are for you."
"No, you're not going anywhere."
"It's my lucky number."
"I want to be done with this."
"This is a work in progress."
"The hunter becomes the hunter."
"We had a big argument."
"I can't hear myself think anymore."
"This is a police investigation."
"They have to get you away from here."
"Let me take care of you."
"No, and I don't care."
"I think I'm ready."
"Yes, it's a long story."
"Do you really want me to come?"
"Oh, that looks good."
"The man I wanted to see."
"I don't recognize anything at all."
"I am here to protect you."
"I would like you to accompany me."
"I went to school."
"I agree with them."
"I heard about her."
"God, the girls loved him."
"Take as much as you want."
"And you never will be."
"What did you do last night?"
"The world needs you."
"My time, my city, my family."
"No, we're not going anywhere."
"He's been doing this for years."
"Dad, we need to talk."
"Let's see what we can find."
"Do we know who did this?"
"Who put that in there?"
"I'm going to need this."
"You are right about one thing."
"Do I have to do everything myself?"
"It's hidden under your bed."
"Have you taken drugs?"
"These are the basic principles."
"I have some things to do."
"You will tell me about it."
"There are guards everywhere."
"I need to talk to you for a minute."
"Do you have anything planned?"
"I don't play golf."
"They are not the only ones."
"I'm sure she'll understand."
"And how are we going to do that?"
"He still has a lot to learn."
"I will answer all your questions."
"I'll call you back in an hour."
"Friends don't do that."
"Bring the wood and the oil."
"How did the operation go?"
"We have scores to settle."
"I am not a victim."
"You get that from your father."
"I wish we could be friends."
"I hope you're happy."
"I think he's ready."
"I didn't invite them."
"This one is really good."
"I loved him more than anything."
"It only happens once."
"They will be here in an hour."
"I thought you were friends."
"But we will still go into battle."
"I was hoping you were here."
"But he didn't come."
"I knew she was there."
"Is that what you say?"
"I need more than that."
"You didn't say it."
"It's easier for you."
"What is your phone number?"
"You have it."
"He's one of my men."
"Thousands of people running."
"I made you something to eat."
"I think I know him."
"You didn't expect that?"
"What will they do with us?"
"He told me to come."
"It's high-end."
"I have no questions."
"You have to live with the times."
"No, you can't enter."
"I'm the one inviting you."
"I was glad to see you."
"I knew I knew you."
"I remember this place."
"I spoke to my mother."
"I just wanted to say goodbye."
"I wanted to surprise him."
"I wanted to wish you good luck."
"I've heard about it before."
"There is a price on his head."
"Better not to talk about it."
"I don't have a partner."
"I'll get you something to eat."
"Be careful what you wish for."
"I can't call him."
"It seems like everything is fine."
"You'll find someone else."
"The dark side of the Moon."
"Who do you think it is?"
"I'll be a little late."
"Maybe it's a chance."
"All right, I have to go."
"It's you I choose."
"You're not saying hello to me?"
"Can't we work something out?"
"He invited me to dinner."
"I'll make you something to eat."
"You made fun of me."
"I have a favor to ask."
"We're one step ahead."
"I said I was coming."
"I slit his throat."
"You are here to advise him."
"She is a very pretty girl."
"Do you want me to carry you?"
"I want a glass of water."
"I can take you to him."
"I'm going to be on TV."
"She threw herself at me."
"I often have the same dream."
"It's show time."
"I'm going to get back to work."
"I'm starting to wonder."
"I've known her for years."
"He's the one who finds you."
"I want to be home for dinner."
"I'm halfway there."
"Maybe we should just let it go."
"An endangered species."
"I have to explain to you."
"It's just sex."
"I want to introduce you to a friend."
"Do we serve it by the pint?"
"Do what she tells you."
"What do you miss?"
"What if it was the other way around?"
"You came to tell me that?"
"Can I talk to you for two minutes?"
"You're probably right, as always."
"What kind of woman are you?"
"I have a permit for that."
"Can I have another drink?"
"What about that?"
"I have a friend there."
"I arrived just in time."
"Of course I would."
"Go ahead, ask Rosie to dance."
"You're going to move to the chair."
"Let me take care of him."
"Ask him what you want."
"They took me by surprise."
"It won't go that far."
"Maybe you should talk to him."
"Yeah, I've heard that before."
"In the south of France."
"I thought you'd like it."
"That's my last name."
"He's still not here."
"You didn't say no."
"I have a knack for it."
"Of course, you're welcome."
"So what's next?"
"I had some shopping to do."
"That's a good start, right?"
"This is your son."
"See you in a few hours."
"Well, good enough for my companions."
"I'm sure you'll find it."
"I knew it was true."
"Did I speak another language?"
"Listen, we need to talk."
"How long can it last?"
"We had fun, didn't we?"
"We'll give you a sedative."
"Did you give him a chance?"
"Don't you want to kiss me?"
"Is everyone in place?"
"This is the truth before God."
"I need to talk to my mother."
"I just wanted to go home."
"I brought you some tea."
"I've been here since the beginning."
"They are not here yet."
"We know it's you."
"You have to make up your mind."
"It's a game of chess."
"I had a wonderful evening."
"Please, not that."
"You don't want me to come?"
"You can answer the question."
"I have his phone number."
"He moved on."
"Across the river."
"Is that where you were?"
"I come from another planet."
"He might still be there."
"I have to take care of her."
"I thought back to our conversation."
"It's a state of mind."
"That's cool, that's cool."
"You've never seen me."
"I was stood up."
"We are on the same team."
"There are bodies everywhere."
"Go see the other side."
"Tell me everything will be okay."
"I am much more than that."
"It has my name on it."
"I've been thinking about it for a while."
"I'm going to make your party."
"Well, that's a first."
"She wouldn't have done that."
"It was great to see you."
"We'll talk about it in the car."
"You haven't changed much."
"There is much to say."
"You still have a lot to learn."
"You slept all day."
"Okay, we got it."
"The exception that proves the rule."
"What else do you want to do?"
"Do exactly as I say."
"No, no, you don't understand."
"I hope it gets better."
"Actually, it's very simple."
"The door, please."
"He was very lucky."
"I wrote you a poem."
"I really need to talk."
"Do you know who did it?"
"Did I ask your opinion?"
"It's done, it's done."
"Do you want to know where he is?"
"It gives me hope."
"Please look at me."
"I have to ask you a favor."
"Can I borrow a pen from you?"
"I don't work for him anymore."
"It was what it was."
"You know you like it."
"I know it, I know it."
"I remember, an old guy."
"I love it when you do that."
"I choose the life of mortals."
"And I want to be with you."
"She's somewhere around there."
"I want to make love to you."
"I gave him life."
"It's better than nothing, right?"
"No, I don't have them."
"There is music."
"It's more important than that."
"Very soon he will ask you."
"What's the point of all this?"
"Give it some time."
"There was another one."
"Everything that happened."
"What color are his eyes?"
"I only have her left."
"Have you thought about my proposal?"
"Sounds nice to me."
"It's like a movie."
"Tell him to go home."
"I don't know the answers."
"I'll call you in an hour."
"Thank you for being there for me."
"I'll give you a demonstration."
"There is another explanation."
"I want to speak to a manager."
"For the same reason as you."
"I need a massage."
"Leave me, please."
"Can you come back in an hour?"
"Look what I can do."
"He needs a friend."
"I think you're ready."
"But you have to go."
"Do you think you'll make it?"
"With ribbons in her hair."
"I keep saying it."
"We studied together."
"I hope you find her again."
"I can't either."
"You should join us."
"Do you want to argue?"
"Do you want me to apologize?"
"It's just the cat."
"I want you to talk to him."
"Keep your eyes on the road."
"Do you want me to call them?"
"The operation was a success."
"What are you doing up so late?"
"I love him more than anything."
"And how are you going to do that?"
"I never did anything."
"I'm on the case, Captain."
"Do you know what I do?"
"I'm just hungry."
"I understand you completely."
"I think she likes you."
"I can't even read."
"May the Force be with us."
"He only talks about that."
"I met her once."
"The one I gave you?"
"Once or twice a year."
"He's a bit old-fashioned."
"He said he was coming back."
"I think that's fair."
"I was born in this house."
"I have a tip for you."
"Put your arm around me."
"That's more or less it."
"I have work to finish."
"Does he have a last name?"
"We do as we said."
"On my mother's life."
"He will always be dependent on him."
"No, it looks good."
"I need a second."
"It looks like it's him."
"And they call that a mine?"
"I have my own idea about that."
"I think you know each other."
"Please, this way."
"It was love at first sight."
"There is good news."
"Someone did this to him."
"I got them from my mother."
"This is what you need to do."
"She needs to be taken care of."
"Six, five, four, three, two, one."
"Who likes to play with me?"
"He knows we are here."
"It has never been proven."
"I'll put you on the right track."
"It's about power."
"It was taken out of context."
"That's what they think."
"I see only one solution."
"Do you know where he might be?"
"Nobody calls me a wimp."
"Do you love him more than me?"
"But I still love you."
"What is it, Father?"
"She's just a little girl."
"I'll get some beer."
"His throat was slit."
"It's longer than expected."
"That's what she believes."
"I knew it would be you."
"He will have to hold out until tomorrow."
"Thank you for lending it to me."
"I need another drink."
"From what I know."
"I wanted to let you know."
"I barely touched her."
"I know more than you."
"I think it's getting better."
"I had business to attend to."
"Maybe it's just me."
"No, not that I remember."
"He will try to take the Ring."
"I need something else."
"I thought you had it."
"I've been waiting for this moment for so long."
"It's just luck."
"She might have rabies."
"I didn't think about it anymore."
"I am changing."
"But he never came back."
"I've had better days."
"I'm on the other side."
"Someone has to do this."
"Thank you for agreeing to come."
"You will see that ringing doors."
"Good luck to both of you."
"Is your mother at home?"
"Did you leave the door open?"
"Who knows when we'll see each other again?"
"This is really not funny."
"I'm not going to calm down."
"It's a question of ethics."
"I can't ask you that."
"What kind of man does that?"
"They were never found."
"I think you're looking for me."
"I left you messages."
"Of course it was."
"We need a service."
"Nobody told me about it."
"I am a night owl."
"Everything is fine, it will be fine."
"I have to leave right away."
"Or anyone else."
"I had never experienced that."
"Am I okay?"
"I want to be proud of you."
"There is nothing outside."
"I thought you forgot."
"I can do it for you."
"It was up to me to decide."
"I need to introduce you to someone."
"Do you know anything about this?"
"We saw each other twice."
"You just have to do it."
"Any idea who it was?"
"I never liked it."
"I did all the tests."
"I go there every day."
"Want to see something cool?"
"I think I know her."
"I'm the one who messed up."
"I sent him a text."
"We need to ask you some questions."
"I wanted to stop him."
"He went to the Elves."
"I didn't think this would happen."
"I should have started there."
"I had never thought of that."
"Do you want me to find out?"
"I may have seen it."
"It sounded better in my head."
"Well, look who's here."
"I'm looking for one of your clients."
"Dad went 'hunting'."
"Tell her I'll call her back."
"I want to get them out of there."
"I think he's sick."
"Do you want to see each other again?"
"It's the same every day."
"I'll walk you to your car."
"And everyone is happy."
"Do you want to make money?"
"I think it was you."
"I'll look inside."
"Where did you learn to drive?"
"You are what you are."
"How are you getting along?"
"Call me when you're done."
"He locked it from the inside."
"Did you talk to him about that?"
"I mean what I say."
"Do you take credit cards?"
"I see you every day."
"With everything that's going on."
"It might be an accident."
"You know what would be cool?"
"He said he loved me."
"Sorry, but that's how it is."
"She is a flight attendant."
"Don't spend it all at once."
"No stopping before nightfall."
"My family needs me."
"What do we take?"
"What exactly is happening?"
"I thought I was dreaming."
"It's just a house."
"Are you out of your mind?"
"She knows what it is."
"There is another man."
"With this ring, I marry you."
"Let's go see what it is."
"That's what brings me here."
"I only think of him."
"I think it's obvious."
"What I feared has happened."
"At the beep, you know what to do."
"They're just kids."
"I've been coming here for years."
"He arrived before dawn."
"Maybe she knows something."
"Do you love someone else?"
"This is very good advice."
"He said you would understand."
"I'm older than you."
"What can it do for you?"
"I am not a scientist."
"It was my birthday present."
"No, I don't see it."
"Did you bring me something?"
"At least tell me your name."
"I was homesick."
"I fought for you."
"That's where she is."
"Is there a toilet here?"
"I want to go to the beach."
"Of course I think so."
"We both were."
"It's only been a week."
"I found it on the ground."
"No, I didn't know anything about it."
"No, I haven't been drinking."
"I bet that's it."
"The ball is in their court."
"Is she a friend of yours?"
"I saw it twice."
"They are not servants."
"Is there a God?"
"I think we should talk."
"I need it for work."
"I haven't heard of it."
"Do you know that?"
"I'm going to count to five."
"Does he love you?"
"I told you so, man."
"She asked me to come."
"Whose daughter is she?"
"Nothing is happening here."
"I have tears in my eyes."
"It takes a little time."
"I have plans for you."
"We are men of our word."
"I was just waiting for the right moment."
"Isn't that always the case?"
"I'll call you from there."
"We have a man down."
"Do I have any?"
"There is a good reason."
"He's getting on my nerves."
"He will keep it all his life."
"I will take you to him."
"I would give my life for you."
"It's nice of you to do that."
"It's really not my thing."
"Actually, I think so."
"I'm at the police station."
"What about her?"
"She just needs time."
"Nobody asked you."
"It's only been two weeks."
"I know you like me."
"It's great to see you again."
"Only we are left."
"I didn't have the chance."
"Tonight is the party."
"What if you don't come back?"
"I talk to him however I want."
"You have a choice to make."
"What kind of question is this?"
"I learned to live with it."
"I knew you would be there."
"Have you ever seen this woman?"
"I was wondering when you would come."
"I have someone in mind."
"How did he find us?"
"I need to talk to my brother."
"Do you have an ID card?"
"I heard him say it."
"Please tell me."
"That's what he was doing."
"You get what you pay for."
"We have to go to school."
"Do you hear me?"
"We'll see if it works."
"He asked me to dance."
"Are you asking me that?"
"We need to give it a name."
"They said where they were going?"
"I'm not parting with it."
"You were just a kid."
"He is ready to receive you."
"She did it herself."
"She can't wait to see you."
"I keep telling him."
"What, what is it?"
"Don't drag me into this."
"I almost called the police."
"I have some news for you."
"Of course we are."
"I saw her once."
"You're just a man."
"I will call you back as soon as possible."
"It's just a kiss."
"Do you love him that much?"
"She said she would come."
"I have to get you out of here."
"Everything is fine for now."
"You will feel better tomorrow morning."
"And now we have two."
"She's on the other side."
"He was the one who called."
"I know you love it."
"All the honor is ours."
"Everyone does what they want."
"Guys, please."
"Jim, what's going on?"
"Do I know that?"
"We're going to have a good evening."
"What I've always done."
"I'm just a child."
"How should I tell you?"
"I knew you were coming."
"But he never came."
"Welcome to the big leagues."
"I think we found it."
"I want us to stay friends."
"Can you tell us more?"
"Do you know what it's about?"
"I have to finish this first."
"She was never found."
"She is never late."
"I had a miscarriage."
"Wait, what's going on?"
"It just happened for you."
"Do you want me to drive you?"
"No, I don't know them."
"Go see what he wants."
"It's a love letter."
"I'm going to explain something to you."
"I've never seen the ocean."
"I did this all by myself."
"This is my gift to you."
"Here's how it's going to happen."
"Neither to me, nor to anyone."
"I'll come as soon as I can."
"I know you were friends."
"From one second to the next."
"I'm going to talk to my boss."
"Thank you, that's kind of you."
"Please, not now."
"The result will always be the same."
"I like it when you do that."
"Everything I've done."
"And we always have been."
"What can I do for your service?"
"What can't you do?"
"I think we understand."
"Hello, who's speaking?"
"I'll get him out of there."
"He went through the window."
"You asked to see me."
"Tell her she's beautiful."
"There is one last thing."
"It was her idea."
"People don't want it."
"That's what it seems."
"I have thought about your proposal."
"I heard about them."
"No, what's going on?"
"Salt pork is particularly tasty."
"These are the king's colors."
"Do you want me to follow you?"
"Because I believe in you."
"Don't talk to me about that."
"She slept all day."
"I'll call you back as soon as possible."
"Can it wait?"
"Sooner or later, it had to happen."
"I know he will."
"I'm at peace with that."
"This is my phone number."
"Tell me what I want."
"The horses keep him awake."
"It is a sign of respect."
"These are not stories."
"She is not a child."
"It is written in the Bible."
"You don't want anything else?"
"I have to do it myself."
"You know how children are."
"Do you want to hold my hand?"
"Why did you do all this?"
"Glad we agree."
"You are a businessman."
"Didn't you hear her?"
"What do you expect from life?"
"I think you're finished."
"There are two more."
"I've never seen anything."
"Excuse me, I have something to do."
"I have a score to settle."
"I work for a living."
"Tell him I'm busy."
"I already explained it to you."
"I need your cooperation."
"I don't know, guys."
"I want to go to school."
"We are so close to the goal."
"I was expecting to see you."
"Anyone can do this."
"I will do what you say."
"It's good, it's done."
"We need to talk about something."
"Love is in the air."
"He's the one I love."
"You didn't ask me anything."
"Is it that important to you?"
"That was kind of you."
"What can you tell me about it?"
"I have my theory on that."
"I have to ask him some questions."
"I think she's fine."
"What are they planning?"
"Tell me what you like."
"We're both fine."
"Do you remember what they tasted like?"
"You can't ask me that."
"You will be in the one at the end."
"My Indian daughter, my Indian daughter.."
"No, I didn't mean that."
"I was thinking about nothing else."
"Do what he asks you to do."
"There is a small change."
"My memory is playing tricks on me."
"I have to get her out of there."
"Well, what do you think?"
"Are you responsible for this?"
"Did you know about that?"
"I'll take care of the girl."
"He worked all night."
"You must have some idea."
"You've already done enough."
"Where do you want us to go?"
"What do I take?"
"My hand is shaking."
"What are you doing in my bed?"
"I take care of my men."
"I'll show you your rooms."
"Is it that good?"
"This is God's plan."
"I have memory lapses."
"Are you the one who makes them?"
"Was it worth it?"
"What do you want it to be?"
"That's my stage name."
"Your brother was a big investment."
"I will see each of their faces."
"He is a beautiful little boy."
"I have thought about your offer."
"That's what I was."
"I am someone else."
"What would I look like?"
"But it went well."
"No one else knows."
"That's it, that's good."
"That's it, it's good."
"Do you want me to explain?"
"I want you to love me."
"Come on, I have something to talk to you."
"Come, I have something to talk to you."
"I did it for love."
"I need to do this."
"I wanted to talk to you about this."
"I am at your entire disposal."
"You're home now."
"I can go wherever I want."
"There is something for you."
"With milk and sugar?"
"But I know how to read a manual."
"Thank you for saving my son."
"The Ring is safe here."
"He said it himself."
"Do you want some of that?"
"I need a researcher."
"You can thank me later."
"I didn't ask you."
"What are you going to do with her?"
"OK, what's going on?"
"I never thought so."
"Do you know who you look like?"
"You are stronger than me."
"My feelings haven't changed."
"We're all going to get involved."
"But what's my head?"
"This is our way out."
"Have you heard about me?"
"What do you imagine?"
"You have very beautiful eyes."
"What's going on, Sergeant?"
"Call me when it's done."
"I would like to say goodbye to him."
"You don't understand English?"
"I'm having a great time."
"I saw you looking at me."
"You can't defeat him."
"You are not a woman."
"I might know someone."
"I should go there."
"Maybe you should call him."
"When were you planning to tell me about it?"
"There is nothing anyone can do about it."
"Don't apologize for me."
"I have read all of his books."
"I took it for you."
"I really have to go now."
"She means nothing to me."
"Leave them out of it."
"What are you missing?"
"I want to come home."
"She is not one of us."
"What do you want to do later?"
"Let's hope it doesn't come to that."
"You make me want to throw up."
"There is a better way."
"Do you know what awaits us?"
"I have a decision to make."
"All because of you."
"No need to get to that point."
"Let me take a look at it."
"Go see what he's doing."
"That's right, he's right."
"I was in high school with him."
"What else did you find?"
"She needs a lawyer."
"It's out of reach now."
"It's just a hobby."
"Tell me I'm beautiful."
"I'm not hungry yet."
"I did it for them."
"I didn't recognize him."
"Because it's the law."
"Did you work all night?"
"Are you ready to do it?"
"I just wanted to be with you."
"I'll be here when you get back."
"Your place is by my side."
"It's true, I assure you."
"You do it every time."
"What are we missing?"
"I'll meet you in the car."
"I have someone for you."
"Where were you the night before last?"
"Thank you for letting me come."
"Have you ever heard of it?"
"I just did my job."
"It's me you love."
"And the rest of the team?"
"Thank you for receiving us so quickly."
"I need my car."
"I need all of this."
"Did you see someone passing by?"
"You don't believe in God?"
"What else have you done?"
"You know how women are."
"You should take a look at it."
"But I need him."
"Look what they did."
"He's someone important."
"It's time to talk."
"I always trusted you."
"I'm taking him to the infirmary."
"I feel it in the earth."
"I had something else in mind."
"Who is the chief's daughter dating?"
"I see it, I see it."
"I'm glad to have you."
"Yes, I was told that."
"I have one thing to say."
"I just need some air."
"He knows what it is."
"And how do you plan to do that?"
"We have to get this over with."
"A cognac, please."
"We have less than an hour."
"I brought you a coffee."
"Then what happened?"
"I will never tell you."
"I did this once."
"You shouldn't go there."
"You'll have that on your conscience."
"I know the rules of the game."
"Night flights are prohibited."
"There is little hope."
"Do you want to go out together?"
"You asked me to come."
"Who wants to go first?"
"Anyway, it's over."
"You know what's going to happen."
"There are lots of people."
"I will, I will."
"It's the other way around."
"A place on the last boat."
"The best time of my life."
"That's the most important thing."
"She moved on."
"We'll get it next time."
"We've been here for an hour."
"No sex before marriage."
"Please stay calm."
"What else are you hiding from me?"
"They are just objects."
"I slipped in the shower."
"I can do magic."
"That's what's beautiful."
"I'll be here all week."
"I gave you life."
"I did anything."
"It's such a beautiful day."
"You didn't ask me."
"It's okay, he's gone."
"You lived up to it."
"I don't know him personally."
"No question of talking about that."
"Of course I'm happy."
"You must be able to do something."
"I think you'll like it."
"Exactly what we need."
"Everyone is so nice."
"I saw you talking to him."
"Whether we like it or not."
"I would like to speak to my brother."
"I went to see a shrink."
"It's my trademark."
"Do you think it worked?"
"When is the big day?"
"It's the law of the market."
"I was there, remember?"
"You've had it long enough."
"I am the night watchman."
"Feel the strength of his legs."
"I am something else."
"Do you see what you're doing?"
"She's not a witch."
"You called me about that?"
"Since when has he been like this?"
"I can do this on my own."
"Don't you want to relax?"
"I'm doing this for your own good."
"She prefers plants to people."
"How did you find me here?"
"He did what he wanted."
"See you after class."
"What's going on behind?"
"Just take me home."
"She would never have done that."
"It's so much more than that."
"It all started with the Great Rings."
"I can't really say."
"The Black Gate is very close."
"I'm going to the other side."
"You're going to wake everyone up."
"I'll be back in a little while."
"I know how to talk to people."
"You don't know a lot."
"You know what would be awesome?"
"I stay out of it."
"I put them in water."
"The secondary belt is also load-bearing."
"Yes, that's a bit like it."
"It will be a breeze."
"That might be a good idea."
"You are the guest of honor."
"Don't just think about yourself."
"I called you last night."
"It was last minute."
"Is everything okay between you two?"
"It's the end of the month."
"A secondary belt and an inner one."
"I wish you to be happy."
"We'll see then."
"Of course I'm interested."
"I'm tired of talking."
"Did you do biology?"
"I never wrote that."
"I'll get us some coffee."
"They are all around us."
"You would be doing me a great favor."
"You're safer here."
"I already called the police."
"Should I get on my knees?"
"I need to know where he is."
"I wish she were here."
"Put it on speaker."
"Just what we need."
"What did you do before the war?"
"I thought it was done."
"That's what she thinks."
"And how long will it take?"
"You're going to get one."
"I'm on a business trip."
"We have it in our bones."
"This is just my opinion."
"It's good for circulation."
"Can you do it or not?"
"You said it was important."
"It's worth what it's worth."
"And where does that come from?"
"Okay, you win."
"Who gave you permission?"
"That's what we hoped for."
"Don't you have any idea?"
"She's not afraid of anything."
"Its goal: to prevent another war."
"Moonlight at noon?"
"I feel a draft."
"What I do best."
"The first round will be for me."
"I saw his true face."
"On the other side of the bridge."
"He is on the other side."
"No, I didn't notice."
"Tell him what you think."
"Beautiful morning, isn't it?"
"I want to become a normal being again."
"Gallop, show us your speed."
"He's gone for good."
"Who knows what they want?"
"I'll give you one last chance."
"You took me by surprise."
"This is my idea."
"But there are laws."
"I spoke to the police."
"It was stronger than him."
"I can't find it."
"What if there were deaths?"
"There were many."
"I did everything for you."
"So how does she know?"
"I have to think about the future."
"You know what we want."
"Is everyone in position?"
"That's what I'm here for, right?"
"You've never been married?"
"I just told the truth."
"What do you bet?"
"That's it, you're right."
"I left you a note."
"Are you a girl or what?"
"Go get him some water."
"I have to keep busy."
"I walked out the door."
"This is actually a good thing."
"Thank you for having me come."
"Have you ever seen this guy?"
"This is where it all begins."
"That's all that was left."
"Ready for firing."
"I saw you kissing him."
"See you in a few days."
"Will the Ring be safe there?"
"I thought he loved me."
"Anytime, anywhere."
"Nina, what's going on?"
"So see you later."
"Do you want to come home?"
"But he did nothing."
"Tell the other clans to come."
"Because it is one."
"What if I get caught?"
"He asked to see you."
"You have things to do."
"It's so important to me."
"How could you say that?"
"Bring me one of those chickens."
"Did he take drugs?"
"What's going on, Mom?"
"We have the house to ourselves."
"But I found some bacon."
"It is up to His Eminence to decide."
"She knows we are here."
"I made one for myself."
"I am one of the highest paid."
"I need to speak to your father."
"Nobody told you?"
"I haven't heard anything."
"But I needed a partner."
"We have the night ahead of us."
"You know I'm innocent."
"She needs her father."
"I swear on my mother."
"Did someone say something?"
"How dare you make this decision?"
"I want you to look at me."
"Do you know anything about him?"
"What is it, madam?"
"No, you don't have it."
"He is in serious condition."
"In your hip, under the skin."
"How long will you last here?"
"What if he doesn't want to?"
"Isn't life beautiful?"
"She wasn't like that."
"Please say yes."
"Where did you get this?"
"We'll go to New Orleans."
"I just need to know."
"You know how people are."
"I just can't."
"I told him about us."
"They both were."
"See what you have done."
"She was there just now."
"Did you get the mega-info?"
"I could say the same thing."
"And it never will be."
"No one else does."
"You know what they say?"
"How can you not know?"
"She jumped off a bridge."
"I need permission."
"Got something in mind?"
"And you can choose a woman."
"That will do more for me."
"Do you want me to calm down?"
"You're taking a shuttle again this evening."
"I expected something else."
"I got your file, Corporal."
"That means it works."
"Do you remember all that?"
"She slit her wrists."
"I'll take care of the paperwork."
"No, I wouldn't do that."
"I thought you might want to know."
"But you have to tell him first."
"He had something to do."
"What shocks you?"
"It's part of my charm."
"It's probably for the best."
"Where did you think it was?"
"I see you inside."
"Can't you understand that?"
"Be careful what you do."
"I want to do this for you."
"Do I need a reason?"
"I didn't even touch her."
"It's a family trait."
"One word, please."
"I brought you some wine."
"That's music."
"He knows what he's saying."
"I wanted to speak to you privately."
"I hope I never see you again."
"I am the one you are looking for."
"We are in the same class."
"Could we talk about something else?"
"The next one will be your last, little one."
"Nobody knows who he is."
"We'll see what happens."
"I read his mind."
"When you want, where you want."
"It's time for dessert."
"They are ready to receive you."
"This is what we can do."
"My God, I beg you."
"Don't like sex?"
"Tell him it's me."
"It's a very beautiful story."
"All we need."
"You should see the other guy."
"Do you know whose it is?"
"He knows what's going on."
"Who did you sell it to?"
"Of course he's there."
"There are still plenty of them."
"What big teeth you have."
"Don't give me orders."
"How are you going to get through this?"
"I speak from experience."
"I would like to ask him a few questions."
"Someone should say something."
"Let's hope it doesn't come to anything."
"Do you hear it, near the barbed wire?"
"I'll transfer them to your account."
"I'll count to ten."
"Mom, what happened?"
"And that is the truth."
"Show him some respect."
"Why did you do that to him?"
"Do you know what you are saying?"
"Let me open the door for you."
"I did a good job."
"What do you think I do?"
"I want to go back to school."
"Give me your phone number."
"He's heading straight for us."
"Tell him I'm looking for him."
"A way to leave the island."
"You can go anywhere."
"Which is a good thing."
"I know this kind of man."
"You are always there for me."
"Let him go, did you hear me?"
"I want to move forward."
"I have my feet on the ground."
"You didn't go there?"
"That's a bit like it, yes."
"It's going to be a good day."
"I needed to talk to you."
"Aren't you letting me in?"
"My father taught me that."
"I can always count on you."
"You have a very beautiful voice."
"We will send them a message."
"No, it's fine, everything's fine."
"This is an opportunity to be seized."
"I barely touched you."
"They are not the same."
"I brought you a present."
"It's written all over your face."
"Do you want to listen to music?"
"We have a lot of good women."
"She has a message for you."
"I spent my life here."
"Give him a hand."
"Nobody knows where we are."
"Do you know his last name?"
"I need to get a makeover."
"This is what happened to me."
"He did it for you."
"I needed to hear it."
"There are other places."
"And it's been going on for years."
"See you at training."
"Tell them what's going on."
"I know you know him."
"I'll do it next time."
"I forgot to turn it off."
"It's a very beautiful house."
"No, you're not listening to me."
"He offered me a drink."
"No, I didn't do that."
"Have you brushed your teeth?"
"Like a letter in the mail."
"See you at the hospital."
"It can be anyone."
"Your wife is still online."
"See the world we come from."
"I know they are there."
"You have a sharp tongue."
"I will take good care of you."
"Nothing was done to you."
"I'm the only one left."
"Because I am one."
"I heard about your mother."
"I thought you were."
"Have you spoken to your wife?"
"What were you doing on the lake?"
"I would like a glass of water."
"Will he come back?"
"It's only been a few days."
"They say it's important."
"Give him a glass of water."
"You are part of the team."
"It's a school night."
"I trust your judgment."
"No, he doesn't know."
"What's his real name?"
"I need to relax."
"I have worked with him before."
"What do your elf eyes see?"
"He is a handsome young man."
"You love a shadow, a thought."
"What's so wonderful about it?"
"It's a fairy tale."
"We are happy to welcome you."
"I never had a choice."
"I love you, Sugar Bunny."
"This is far from enough."
"No, he wouldn't do that."
"I spoke to you on the phone."
"Well, what do you say?"
"It has to be me."
"We need strong people."
"How many drinks did you have?"
"I eat what I want."
"We appreciate your volunteering."
"I just do it."
"Let me take you home."
"Were there any injuries?"
"He led us here."
"How did you get my picture?"
"I need my bag."
"Fly as fast as the winds."
"What kind of father are you?"
"I always wanted to be a doctor."
"You know where you hope to go."
"I had some things to take care of."
"It won't be long, I promise."
"You owe me at least that much."
"How did you get past the guards?"
"You say what you think."
"I don't really think about it."
"She left this for you."
"She can't help it."
"What should I expect?"
"I'll use the gas first."
"What if someone sees us?"
"Seeds from the Sacred Tree."
"I'm not going to call him."
"I often thought of you."
"What if he doesn't make it?"
"Someone else was there."
"For the sake of my family."
"I've always wanted to meet you."
"He says he's fine."
"You know you love me."
"He only thinks of himself."
"I see who you're talking about."
"Go through the area with a fine-tooth comb."
"I just wanted to say goodnight."
"That's good stuff, huh?"
"You've had a long day."
"From my wife."
"Are there still many?"
"There is a door behind."
"Maybe he'll listen to you."
"At this time of night?"
"What if he can't?"
"That's it for this time."
"I just received a message."
"I cut my hand."
"It's you I'm looking for."
"He needs a lesson."
"He can manage on his own."
"I have family there."
"I'll do it, this eight."
"I don't see her anywhere."
"I owe you money."
"Here, this will do you good."
"At nightfall."
"Do you see where I am?"
"There will be change."
"It's a question of will."
"Is this where you work?"
"No, she won't."
"Do you think they'll come?"
"This is the end of the journey."
"Do you know who this man is?"
"Now, while it's fresh."
"What else about the structure?"
"We will be more comfortable."
"Do you love me that much?"
"He is a very interesting person."
"There might be something."
"Have you ever seen one?"
"You're a big boy now."
"Because it won't happen."
"It's good for the skin."
"You say you want to protect your own?"
"I had never seen them."
"Do you want me to go see?"
"I owe him at least that much."
"I just asked a question."
"Did he talk to anyone?"
"Do you understand what he's saying?"
"I'll see how she is."
"Did someone call the police?"
"And I know you do too."
"This is one for me."
"Do you remember our conversation?"
"I'm just looking at you."
"It's just a date."
"Shall we get laid?"
"You are in a restricted area."
"I told you to come."
"Well, that's a relief."
"You're the one talking about it."
"I have read all your books."
"I have to tell you something else."
"I kept calling."
"What if something happens to you?"
"I asked you to come."
"Is this an empathy test?"
"I am a man of the people."
"Is he a relative of yours?"
"I've never felt so good."
"Promise me you'll train the boy."
"What time did he leave?"
"What do you say about these shrimps?"
"Say hello to your father for me."
"That's his way of doing things."
"You can have whoever you want."
"Not as far as you're concerned."
"Milk, please."
"I know it's me."
"Family is family."
"I'm just saying it."
"The back door is open."
"It might do you some good."
"We'll do just fine."
"All day, every day."
"You don't know his name?"
"Sorry, I have to take this call."
"I expected nothing less."
"Do you want to go eat something?"
"This must be stopped."
"This is the case for all of us."
"You've never been married."
"Where is the horn that blew?"
"My son needs me."
"I have to go take a shower."
"I didn't call them."
"It's a nice little blade."
"I hope to hear from you."
"I think we got it."
"Where is Sally's passport?"
"You can always count on me."
"Why do you say that like that?"
"I am open to any suggestions."
"Can I talk to you for two seconds?"
"Someone is going to pay for this."
"A little while ago."
"What do I answer?"
"What is this bin?"
"I need to know everything."
"You're going to need me."
"Is this what you were waiting for?"
"What is your point of view?"
"It's a collector's car."
"Have you been here before, Chief?"
"My father was in the army."
"I'll even do it for you."
"He says he is innocent."
"I'm proud of you, darling."
"I settled the score with him."
"How did the hearing go?"
"How did the audition go?"
"I never asked you anything."
"It shows in your eyes."
"The afternoon essentials."
"Glad to hear you say that."
"I know where you're coming from."
"Glad to see you looking good."
"I have a reputation to maintain."
"I have some on my hand."
"We made you a cake."
"He shook my hand."
"What do you give me in return?"
"I'll tell him to call you."
"They are pieces of wood."
"No safe places around here."
"I wrote it myself."
"Are you out of the hospital?"
"We're going to have a good time."
"Nothing is left to chance."
"Do this in memory of me."
"What will he do with it?"
"I have experienced it."
"Thank you for coming in such large numbers."
"Is it time to go?"
"It was clear as day."
"Is there any beer?"
"She just told me."
"My father always told me that."
"Was it noticeable?"
"He seems very nice."
"How long before the explosion?"
"We'll see more clearly tomorrow."
"I'm looking for a friend of mine."
"I thought you might be interested."
"I knew what to expect."
"I am in the same situation."
"You are stronger than us."
"I have to go back to the hotel."
"I'll be there for dinner."
"With everything you need."
"Have fun at school."
"It's good for the heart."
"What do we see?"
"Do you want it to be me?"
"I need to sort this out."
"This is what you are looking for."
"I understood the lesson well."
"I am very proud of him."
"Have you ever seen this gentleman?"
"They made me listen to it."
"Is that who I think it is?"
"Don't get too attached to it."
"I am a man of faith."
"I have a plan for you."
"But I had an idea."
"Everyone has a story."
"I see red paint."
"I tried to reason with you."
"Who gave you this idea?"
"How do you want me to know?"
"We have something to do."
"There is still work to be done."
"I said I would come."
"I have what you are looking for."
"Your mother needs you."
"It makes things more interesting."
"I'm trying to do my job."
"There are days like that."
"My father told me about it."
"Thank you very much for inviting me."
"Nice to have you join us."
"I put myself in your place."
"You get what you want."
"I hope you get it."
"Because I can do it."
"I have the access card."
"Can I take you home?"
"You have something in common."
"There is a secret passage."
"There is a man here."
"We still have a lot of work to do."
"He never touched me."
"He knows you love him."
"I am only the intermediary."
"You're very lucky."
"Who do you want me to be?"
"He had to leave town."
"Is that what you're suggesting?"
"You will do better next time."
"You'll do better next time."
"It's good for my back."
"That's what they're looking for."
"I love him, that's all."
"It shows on your face."
"It shows on his face."
"Thank you for taking care of me."
"I'll call you when we arrive."
"Of course I was."
"Don't you think she's good?"
"She will take care of you."
"I'm done with her."
"I sent you a picture."
"I wanted you to see this."
"You don't owe anything at all."
"That's my artist name."
"I'll get rid of them."
"Do you have any Panama Red?"
"The Special Victims Unit."
"I've never played it."
"No, I completely understand."
"I have something to check."
"I am sleeping."
"I know who you're talking about."
"Do we flip a coin?"
"This is the end of the press release."
"What does he hope for?"
"Did he show you his license plate?"
"Your psychiatrist told me about it."
"He must have had a good reason."
"Who is responsible for all this?"
"She won't change her mind."
"He's pretty good, you know?"
"On my mother's grave."
"Not if you're a genius."
"See you when I get back."
"I should have remembered."
"Do you want to leave him a message?"
"Of course you're fine."
"Tell us what you see."
"No, I don't accept it."
"He knows you're there."
"Haven't we met before?"
"You'll never get out of here."
"I have a scoop for you."
"Before I change my mind."
"I ask you to forgive me."
"Where did you learn to dance?"
"Maybe I can fix that."
"What about us?"
"I know what he's saying."
"To go from here to Venus?"
"Do you need a minute?"
"How many can there be?"
"I'll show you to your room."
"I slept on the plane."
"What remains to be done?"
"What did he promise you?"
"You'll tell me about it."
"This is God's will."
"I bought you flowers."
"Did you have a good holiday?"
"Because I am a man."
"No tea with that one."
"I have to pick up my children."
"There is always a way out."
"What do you think you are doing?"
"I'll tell them the truth."
"Your ticket please."
"I have a guest room."
"No, that's fine."
"It's like I told you."
"Of course I will."
"I've never read it."
"On earth as it is in heaven."
"As you told me."
"I would have come anyway."
"It's not the same anymore."
"He'll get us out of here."
"Why do you take it like that?"
"I bet it's him."
"Did you buy me a gift?"
"I'll do it alone."
"At the end of the corridor on the left."
"It's his lucky day."
"Maybe she'll change her mind."
"I'd rather not say it."
"Do you have a picture of her?"
"I don't really remember."
"That's absolutely out of the question."
"It's good, we've got it."
"He is still in the hospital."
"How are you doing, everyone?"
"It's just a finger."
"Looks like you were right."
"Have you heard of her?"
"Sounds great to me."
"I knew you would be."
"We have to take care of this."
"But someone did."
"It's a very interesting story."
"Do you know what they call me?"
"Yes, what happened?"
"But there are exceptions."
"I'm on a big case."
"I'll give it back to you later."
"What am I supposed to do with it?"
"He must have a good reason."
"Thank you for thinking of us."
"Who gave the green light?"
"Do you have a flashlight?"
"Do you want to know where she is?"
"He seemed so nice."
"Tell me what you're looking for."
"I don't want an argument."
"I've come to terms with it."
"I had never been here."
"I need the part."
"No, I really can't."
"You must have a lot of questions."
"I'm just curious, that's all."
"I know what it's called."
"I think I hear it."
"Can we talk for a moment?"
"You can come back whenever you want."
"She didn't drown."
"I'll see you again in a few days."
"It's beyond our jurisdiction."
"What do you have in your bag?"
"I'll give it to you later."
"I have a wife and children."
"It's okay, she's gone."
"Please stay here."
"I want to do it with you."
"Did you tell Dad?"
"What if we went together?"
"You should have said something."
"Look where that got you."
"He killed himself."
"The Force is strong in him."
"In this case, it's easy."
"You heard me perfectly."
"What's gone?"
"Guess what I did."
"Can I go with you?"
"Do you do this every day?"
"The security system plan?"
"It's my birth, after all."
"No, you don't think so."
"He wanted you to have it."
"There was shooting."
"I imagine it's possible."
"Love, love, love."
"It does honor to your species."
"I'll wait for you at the car."
"I can't tell him that."
"It's probably better that way."
"The time for change has come."
"It's like last time."
"Do you think it's serious?"
"You must tell me the truth."
"I think that says it all."
"I want to go all the way."
"He must have been quite a man."
"Your father's lightsaber."
"May I know who you are?"
"I would have liked to do much more."
"How much time do you have left?"
"We live in the same city."
"I have two words for you."
"To see what it is."
"Tell him it's over."
"A password is required."
"I don't know the code."
"I'll let them know we're there."
"Have you always been like this?"
"The celebration of the king's coronation."
"It's a girl thing."
"We have to move on."
"Do you know where the others are?"
"Who will take care of him?"
"You'll never be that skilled."
"He is the one who is."
"You can't trust him."
"I need a break."
"Do you want to come, honey?"
"It was a very good idea."
"What's she up to?"
"Who will take care of me?"
"Who else saw this?"
"Don't be shy about us."
"I need him here."
"Please excuse me for interrupting you."
"It's beginner's luck."
"What does she believe?"
"Do you think you live in the future?"
"Actually, I have a question."
"Close the door, please."
"I thought it was tomorrow."
"Lock the base of the western pillars."
"There are electrical disturbances."
"If you would be so kind as to sign here."
"He has been following us for three days."
"I need to contact James."
"What's going on, Captain?"
"I actually wanted to talk to you about it."
"Have you had breakfast?"
"I relieve you of your command."
"Do not drink and drive."
"Ask him what he wants."
"I jump into the water."
"I really had fun."
"I have some in my bag."
"That's what she would like."
"Take care of him for me."
"What does he need?"
"I wanted to tell you the truth."
"Young people don't like light ones?"
"I know what he likes."
"Answer me, please."
"Not from my department, of course."
"I need an office."
"It's a battlefield."
"You must leave her, my brother."
"I hope so anyway."
"I do what I have to."
"No, I won't leave you."
"Thank you for what you do."
"Two more, please."
"I want to feel you inside me."
"Because he's my father."
"Could we talk about it later?"
"Sophie, what happened?"
"Do you think I am?"
"One, two, three, here we go."
"You've never done this?"
"I can smell it on you."
"That's what I felt."
"Where do you think you are going?"
"I need a partner."
"This is excellent work."
"I'll go there and come back."
"It's a matter of loyalty."
"It's just for a week."
"You can talk to me, you know."
"We'll see when we get there."
"You haven't seen her again?"
"She didn't call me back."
"That's good for the five of us."
"Of course it's you."
"I will try to be clear."
"They must be inside."
"Until I come back."
"There was an argument."
"I know things about you."
"It went really well."
"I can't do anything more."
"That's what's great."
"I need to see you again."
"I know it was her."
"I know why you came."
"Or anything else."
"Thank God you're back."
"You're going to pierce my skin."
"Anywhere in the world."
"We split the difference."
"There must be an answer."
"Tonight it's my round."
"Sorry to put you through this."
"She didn't call me."
"How can you trust him?"
"Of course it will work."
"Autopilot takes us there."
"What's going on, Inspector?"
"I'll try to find her."
"This is private property."
"Is this your first time here?"
"What is your name, my boy?"
"Don't you want to see it?"
"What must you think of me?"
"He has something for me."
"Honey, it's a long story."
"Do you think you're a star?"
"I'm going in the opposite direction."
"There are other possibilities."
"I was just a kid."
"I love you, I miss you."
"No, I need you."
"Now there are two."
"What is he carrying?"
"They will elect a new chancellor."
"And I advise you to accept."
"Sounds like it to me."
"What will happen next?"
"Let me return the favor."
"What are you doing up so early?"
"Don't you have another one?"
"I'll make some calls."
"I know she is."
"What do you mean he wasn't there?"
"I remember something."
"I'm going to take a little nap."
"Aren't they all?"
"It's a game of chance."
"He was one of them."
"He is far from home."
"I don't have any others."
"Would you really do that for me?"
"Did you do this all by yourself?"
"You have to know how to share your pleasures."
"I've already spoken to him about it."
"Do you have a wife and children?"
"Hey, what's your name?"
"People are in camps."
"You're my hero, I swear."
"And we need you."
"I'm surprised, that's all."
"Are we waiting for someone else?"
"I need to practice."
"No, no, I'll do it."
"She suspects it, I think."
"I need a woman."
"You were right about one thing."
"That's why you're here, right?"
"And in a modest house too."
"The money is on the table."
"I still have a lot to do."
"Goodbye, my love, my life."
"I saw her, you know."
"I like you, you know."
"How are L.J. and Sara doing?"
"Initiate you ask him to be?"
"I said I understood."
"This is the big league."
"I never understood that."
"I think she's sick."
"Where are my car keys?"
"I had the same reaction."
"Not to me, anyway."
"You don't just walk in like that."
"I'm not yet."
"You can come whenever you want."
"You think that's it?"
"You might need this."
"Okay, see you tomorrow."
"Do you want to play hide and seek?"
"I want you to give yourself."
"That's my way of speaking."
"He's one of my heroes."
"They did a good job."
"But I do my best."
"Stay focused on the present moment."
"And that made me happy."
"Let me make things easier for you."
"I did the whole city."
"I didn't kiss him."
"But she never came."
"I have to do something first."
"Look where that got him."
"It's been like this forever."
"I thought you had changed."
"That was what I wanted."
"This is my honeymoon."
"Give me something to do."
"See you at the airport."
"I have to go do something."
"What do we decide?"
"It's a big day tomorrow."
"It's a birthday party."
"This is what happens to me."
"This may be the solution."
"But we need to talk."
"But we'll get through this."
"Then I arrived at his house."
"I think it was her."
"It's an art form."
"Come on, I need you."
"I need to talk to your mother."
"Do you want us to live together?"
"I know you miss him."
"Who loves you?"
"Do you want us to accompany you?"
"What do you think of this one?"
"Are you Spartacus's wife?"
"I'll tell you one day."
"As you taught me."
"I slept with another woman."
"There's something special about him."
"Anything will do."
"Do you remember my name?"
"I was held up at work."
"I want to stay here this time."
"Let the police handle it."
"Open the door for me, please."
"I'm going to ask her to marry me."
"I know you're awake."
"There was only us."
"This invasion will bring you nothing."
"Would you like to dance with me?"
"His orange body, his green legs?"
"Thank you for taking care of it."
"Do you have a permit for that?"
"She pulls a little to the right."
"They will not be able to compete."
"You know we love you."
"I only want your love."
"He knows a lot of things."
"Where were you all night?"
"I think we're good."
"I need to talk about it."
"Form a line here in front of me."
"I'm not going out with him."
"Is that where you're going?"
"Like a fish in water."
"What else can he do?"
"Once again, my condolences."
"I know he's innocent."
"No, I don't know how to dance."
"You can confide in me."
"Everyone wants to be in it."
"No, you won't do that."
"Do you know why I love you?"
"Maybe I'll do it."
"There was an investigation."
"My father did nothing."
"It's snack time."
"No, I don't have any money."
"I'm going to lay my cards on the table."
"Could we do that later?"
"What about children?"
"Do you want me to let go of you?"
"I didn't think I'd see you again."
"Do you agree with him?"
"It was our first date."
"Do you think I'll make it?"
"I believe in many things."
"He will remember you, Spartacus."
"Am I not the King?"
"Let's go into the shade."
"I have to do this alone."
"I come to you in peace."
"You made a friend."
"I go there every year."
"Do you think it's her?"
"The viceroy will be well guarded."
"No, you have to tell him first."
"I'm tired of walking."
"She started screaming."
"I want to move on."
"It's us they want."
"Thank you for coming, Father."
"I'm seeing someone else."
"But it's going to cost you dearly."
"Don't do this to me now."
"We both love you."
"Other than that, everything is fine."
"It will be better next time."
"Where did he get it?"
"It's good for the soul."
"You come from a hot planet."
"I think you know him."
"How old are you, Grandma?"
"Let's make a pair, him and me."
"But you didn't say anything."
"If you need me."
"I always wanted to come here."
"Senator, you are on your own ground."
"Your sight will return in due time."
"He's fine, he's fine."
"She's my cleaning lady."
"I am part of the family."
"This boy is our last hope."
"What will she think of you?"
"It's always good to take."
"You're a little early."
"I have a specimen of a spider."
"I want to be by your side."
"What would I say?"
"It is the Lord's day."
"Even just once?"
"I was going to ask you that question."
"They were taken captive?"
"You are just a child."
"There is something to eat."
"I asked him to stay."
"Not a word to the press."
"It's okay, I see it."
"That suits me perfectly."
"There must be more."
"I'll tell Dad."
"She has no idea."
"Please take it."
"I've never experienced this."
"I brought you into the world."
"A little more than average."
"Because I don't understand."
"How are you feeling, buddy?"
"This is its reason for being."
"Have you never had an assistant?"
"Your thoughts are with your mother."
"This is a starting point."
"The Chancellor seems hopeful."
"They are at war with Rome."
"And everything that goes with it."
"How should I go about it?"
"I don't remember him."
"A medical evacuation was requested."
"I love to see such beauty."
"I have the right to speak."
"No, you don't know anything about it."
"It took me by surprise."
"The day was very long."
"Can I tell you a story?"
"I should have stayed with you."
"No, I'm not leaving you."
"Would you excuse me for a moment?"
"We saw it on the second floor."
"This is only part of it."
"I need his ships."
"Please, let it go."
"I never know what to say."
"Do whatever you can."
"I am one with the Force."
"I want to talk to you in private."
"And they control the plate."
"You can trust no one."
"There is another body."
"He has a message for you."
"How did he get it?"
"My name is on the door."
"Do we have a count of the prisoners?"
"What does it open?"
"This is the men's restroom."
"She had no family."
"I don't want anything from him."
"What can I do for you, Sebastian?"
"In a few weeks, we will know."
"I talk to him every day."
"The rest of the garrison remains."
"I have a question to ask."
"I saw you with her."
"What's your name, by the way?"
"Thanks for playing the game."
"How long do we have to wait?"
"It's visiting time."
"I take care of the money."
"I think we have everything."
"You're two hours late."
"I did everything myself."
"This is my life, you understand?"
"A year and a half, two years."
"I want to see for myself."
"I'll show you the room."
"Hey, is anyone there?"
"I think he likes it."
"I'll get you some coffee."
"Is it because of us?"
"I hope it works out."
"I didn't do anything to them."
"When did you do all this?"
"Do you want to do it or not?"
"Buy him a drink, will you?"
"What should we do with him?"
"I know everyone here."
"No need to know more."
"No one can cross the Alps."
"I'm done, I'm done."
"I am very proud of her."
"Your Highness, I beg you."
"Because I said no."
"I didn't say a word."
"I'm going to make one."
"Actually, I'm sure of it."
"I'll take a closer look."
"You said it last night."
"I know, but I don't understand."
"Do you remember your mother?"
"Your name is on the list."
"It'll take a second."
"I need my medicine."
"Look what I brought."
"What did you have to tell me?"
"I have a lead in Paris."
"He will tell you the same thing."
"It's up to us to decide."
"Do as I told you."
"What do you do with your days?"
"Bring the parts to the shed."
"Wake up, please."
"What are we going to do to him?"
"I don't know about that."
"What do I have in my body?"
"I had never seen it before."
"I've heard a lot of things."
"In place, please."
"When do we arrive?"
"I need my phone."
"Did you tell anyone?"
"Are you my voters or what?"
"You haven't seen everything."
"I'm fine, everything's fine."
"They found another body."
"I know what I have."
"I'm going to make love to you."
"What do we have on the car?"
"Are you waiting for someone else?"
"No, it was more than that."
"We dance in the same company."
"For the good of humanity."
"May the eternal light protect her."
"You're not a kid anymore."
"I want you to have fun."
"I'm flying out tonight."
"This is your daughter."
"Are you sure you can do it?"
"She had a long journey."
"They all want the same thing."
"She's just doing her job."
"You still have a lot to do."
"What's holding them back?"
"I never touched it."
"Give me what you have."
"Can someone explain this to me?"
"He's smarter than you."
"Not if you don't want to."
"Look what we did."
"You didn't see that."
"I'm tired of this."
"No, I don't believe that."
"You think it's over?"
"Do you want me to wake her up?"
"This is not a judgment."
"I need to talk to my wife."
"It's always been my dream."
"That's what he claims."
"You've never met him."
"I saw you do that."
"I ask you to do it."
"There's no place like home."
"How many years ago?"
"Do we have to go?"
"She told me that too."
"Does she know you're here?"
"Come on girls, let's go."
"The house pays."
"It's a woman thing."
"It looks serious to me."
"The map, please."
"But we're not finished."
"We have an officer down."
"They are coming to force our hand."
"You knew what it was."
"Do you want me to call you back?"
"But we are not."
"Above all, what will I think of you?"
"I have a press conference."
"It saves us time."
"Don't think about anything else."
"Is it always like this here?"
"It's a nightclub."
"I can read, remember?"
"That's a very good point."
"It's a refund, actually."
"I know what she's doing."
"This path is open to you."
"There's only him."
"No one will be able to sell you anymore."
"I wish you had come."
"What's past is past."
"You knew what you were doing."
"I'll come home as soon as I can."
"We are happy to be here."
"Because I have a plan."
"I hear it in your voice."
"I won't say any more."
"And what am I going to do?"
"I remember lessons."
"That doesn't mean anything to me at all."
"That's their way of doing things."
"I'll tell you about that later."
"It's included in the price."
"You told me the truth."
"They might still be there."
"What if he never comes back?"
"You've never had one?"
"I can take you home."
"Did they do something to you?"
"It's a big day, huh?"
"Sorry, but it's the truth."
"He will be here in a few minutes."
"He was a very good friend."
"She is not the same anymore."
"There was a commotion."
"There are some there."
"Any type of ship."
"Maybe it's my imagination."
"You have to do me a favor."
"I paint what I see."
"I'll talk to the boss about it."
"No, I don't want to know."
"We don't care about the kid."
"You want me to believe that?"
"You have your feet on the ground."
"I know exactly where it is."
"Who the hell are you?"
"All pilots, to your stations."
"Everything will be fine, I promise."
"I know it's her."
"My love, you come before God."
"You'd better rest."
"Do you know what it costs?"
"What can they possibly be talking about?"
"Because she's a woman."
"We were at school together."
"You have to be honest with me."
"No, he wasn't there."
"She was happy that I knew."
"Do you know what I believe?"
"For the school newspaper?"
"I was the one who asked."
"How bad is it?"
"No, that's not going to work."
"They do this all the time."
"And I am grateful to you."
"Got someone in mind?"
"Does this name mean anything to you?"
"How dare you say that to me?"
"Someone should do something."
"Everything is fine, I assure you."
"Have you tried talking to him?"
"I told you to come up."
"But we have little time."
"Either way, you win."
"No, I can't stay."
"It's only been a few weeks."
"You always say the same thing."
"And what did she do?"
"I am a man of peace."
"You have to give me something."
"There is always a lining."
"There was a theft."
"It was the best thing to do."
"That's his last name."
"I really have to go to the bathroom."
"I think she's in love."
"I have a task to accomplish."
"He seems fine."
"I brought you some coffee."
"Where did you learn to count?"
"I didn't ask any questions."
"And what will happen?"
"I was thinking the exact same thing."
"I'm his bodyguard."
"You're going to have to come with us."
"I know as much as you do."
"I'll check the back."
"But we don't know anything about it."
"It's never the right time."
"A lot has been said."
"What does she have to do with it?"
"Tony, what happened?"
"Do you think you're my father?"
"Everyone has a past."
"If I may say so, Your Excellency."
"I bet you're hungry."
"I don't ask for your forgiveness."
"I will be the people's champion."
"Do you want to talk about this now?"
"You'll never see him again."
"Please understand me."
"I'll take the same thing."
"Do you know what they want?"
"Everyone has a secret."
"Do you think I forgot?"
"Have you never heard of it?"
"Well, I don't know."
"They are both fine."
"I'm doing it for your own good."
"It's completely legal."
"Can you make less noise?"
"Remember, you were six years old."
"This is a chance for me."
"Where do you want him to be?"
"There are police everywhere."
"I am a man of honor."
"What's that on your face?"
"I know how this is going to end."
"I wonder where they are."
"I'm going to make myself a sandwich."
"So it has to happen."
"Can I have some money?"
"Take care, my dear."
"See you after school."
"I know you're listening to me."
"No one will do it for you."
"You don't have a father."
"I heard about your father."
"It is stable at the moment."
"I'd like to talk to you for a minute."
"And that got me thinking."
"I need to talk to the police."
"There are dozens of them."
"He's done it before."
"She only thinks about that."
"I have nothing more."
"Of course you're right."
"This is what I write."
"I have something interesting."
"I took all my money."
"We must think about the future."
"I've always wanted to try this."
"We must not be seen."
"Who knows what it is?"
"Maybe it will work out."
"Because I needed it."
"Get that into your head."
"You've been through a lot."
"I know how much you love him."
"And nobody saw anything?"
"I have a bus to catch."
"He must have done something."
"Do what they tell you."
"Thanks for doing it so quickly."
"You have done the country a service."
"Is she one of your friends?"
"I know what day it is."
"My back is killing me."
"Where did you hear this name?"
"I've often wondered about that."
"One for me, one for you."
"Yes, of course you can."
"You have one now, Spartacus."
"It's just a machine."
"We are what we eat."
"No nation can resist him."
"You're easily impressed, Ramon."
"You must not go there."
"You can be proud of him."
"Maybe you should sit down."
"I found it on the internet."
"I went to college."
"Can I speak to a manager?"
"This army is for the Republic."
"Where did he find it?"
"I have known many women."
"Did you choose her as your understudy?"
"Don't you want to see me?"
"This is my first day here."
"I'm happy to do it."
"I think it might work."
"I tried to reach him."
"No, you can't leave."
"I've never seen a movie."
"Of what happened."
"I got it, it's good."
"There's something in it."
"Where do all these people come from?"
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
"You need to focus."
"I think I'll make it."
"At least once a week."
"Sir is a very good man."
"Yes, I told him about it."
"I want to tell you one thing."
"I'll be right back, honey."
"I want her to see this."
"It's just the truth."
"No, they become the property of the king."
"I take care of the other one."
"I'll tell you where and when."
"I can take you to her."
"You have to find him."
"This is what I saw."
"But you know how it is."
"You look a lot like your mother."
"The bailiff will take the roll."
"Go home and pet yourself."
"I take you in my arms."
"It's very pretty at your place."
"He has a skull fracture."
"Maybe we shouldn't."
"See you at the hotel."
"But I have hope."
"It's deeper than that."
"I have to take care of him."
"I wondered where she was."
"How could they do that?"
"She needs to know."
"Have you never been here?"
"And I know who you are."
"I have it in my pocket."
"I have a friend with me."
"No, I'll be right there."
"The company is in the red."
"It's a very beautiful role."
"She has been through a lot."
"You are as white as a sheet."
"They get what they want."
"Things happened."
"Whose office is this?"
"And how did it end?"
"I saw this bird yesterday."
"I've been told that often."
"She looks so happy."
"It is one of a kind."
"I don't have a home anymore."
"Who can do such a thing?"
"We will always be there for you."
"No, that's not really it."
"Maybe you can take it."
"Yes, thank you for reminding me."
"What's left for us?"
"Did you have fun tonight?"
"I made it for you."
"I'm from another department."
"I will do what you ask."
"She knows I love her."
"I'll show you how it's done."
"To them, I am Oliver Queen."
"God bless you, my son."
"It will be ready in a minute."
"I hope you understand that."
"My wife is inside."
"This is what awaits us."
"You don't like girls?"
"I need a dose."
"I was going to ask the same question."
"I don't even like him."
"What's on your mind, Sebastian?"
"Did Mo send you?"
"Well, that's something."
"You'll make it this time."
"I can dance the Black Swan."
"How many bullets do you have left?"
"Don't go without me."
"I'll take you to see a doctor."
"I take the children to the village."
"I could be your grandfather."
"It's a cop bar."
"Where was it found?"
"He's one of your fans."
"Because he did."
"You will do as I say."
"Show me some respect."
"We live in a free country."
"It is an honor for us."
"Bryan, you did well."
"Is that what you would like?"
"I have a patient to see."
"Did someone talk to you?"
"These are love letters."
"What do I have to gain?"
"At least tell me his name."
"You always bring everything back to you."
"Little Bryan is a sweetheart."
"I want us to break up."
"She hasn't figured it out yet?"
"I'm glad to be home."
"Almost a year ago."
"Can I call you that?"
"It's one of my rules."
"He did it all by himself."
"You may have seen it."
"I have a class to give."
"I hope you find it again."
"Who is the good dog?"
"I never remember it."
"It must be inside."
"I was unfair to you."
"Hundreds of thousands of dollars."
"Do you think he's right?"
"But what am I getting involved in?"
"She asked me the question."
"He's there all the time."
"I'm delighted to see you."
"Are you going to ask her to marry you?"
"There is another door."
"I'll make us some coffee."
"It's a family name."
"He does it all the time."
"It's the order of things."
"I didn't bring it."
"And what about me?"
"I came to visit you."
"Is all this yours?"
"What are your orders, my master?"
"No point in hiding it."
"She said it was okay."
"You have to promise me something."
"I found this on the internet."
"I have to go get something."
"I'm changing and I'm coming."
"Tell me when you're ready."
"No, we don't know anything about that."
"Glad to have you with us."
"Do you want to tell us something?"
"I need a man."
"That's what's right."
"Are you dizzy?"
"I know what you're playing at."
"Do you make home visits?"
"Only one other knows the truth."
"I train every day."
"Can I spend the night here?"
"So I'll tell you."
"How could I forget that?"
"I hope you are satisfied."
"I want to be near you."
"Come say hello to the lady."
"He never loved me."
"We have more important things to do."
"I've never laughed so much."
"How long do I have to wait?"
"I'll take you to the airport."
"I wrote him a letter."
"It was child's play."
"I'll ask him myself."
"I think he is."
"Where did he get this idea from?"
"I was released on parole."
"I went to see a doctor."
"Take him out of my sight."
"Have a drink for me."
"My people need me."
"I remember that night."
"That's where he lives."
"This is what we were looking for."
"I need to talk to them."
"I've seen this man before."
"It's the result that counts."
"Who did you leave it with?"
"The account is in his name."
"Do you think they'll come back?"
"What kind of person is he?"
"Come sit near me."
"And you're not?"
"There must be a way out."
"I asked him his name."
"I was going to ask her to marry me."
"Do you know what you're missing?"
"I'll tell you exactly."
"He's a very good guy."
"Of course I'll be there."
"I tried to find you."
"I'll see you when I get back."
"So back to square one."
"I tried to reason with him."
"Your father was a good man."
"This is of paramount importance."
"It's fresh meat."
"That's what they'll say."
"I hope you believe me."
"I'm from the FBI."
"Do you know what will happen?"
"What should I do with this?"
"This is good music."
"Have I been good to you?"
"What am I becoming?"
"Do you want to talk about something?"
"I spoke to your lawyer."
"Do you want me to forgive you?"
"I'm in love with someone else."
"Have you ever met a Jedi?"
"She wasn't in town."
"Have you ever dishonored the gods?"
"She came out of nowhere."
"I'm here for a reason."
"I'm on the waiting list."
"I say what I say."
"I chose them myself."
"There is still someone."
"My friends are from the best world."
"Please, not this."
"This is my first time here."
"You've never seen one?"
"Have you done this before?"
"Nobody knows who it is."
"I can't decide."
"It warms my heart."
"You have a big day tomorrow."
"I went to the doctor."
"What are you cooking?"
"That's kind of my thing."
"I want you on my team."
"Oh yeah, I remember."
"You can come, if you want."
"You understood me very well."
"Here, I brought this for you."
"Left, right, left, right, left, right."
"I want the most beautiful."
"You chose."
"You should have accepted my offer."
"She says she's fine."
"I'm trying to lighten the mood."
"There's someone there."
"You wanted to see me for that?"
"I will try to explain to you."
"I told him to stay."
"Are there any volunteers?"
"A signature, please."
"She is no longer among us."
"I have done a lot of things."
"They are not ours."
"Can I do it later?"
"I need a pen."
"I'm faster than you."
"A little over two years."
"But it was more than that."
"When does it begin?"
"I have a brain tumor."
"When will we have the results?"
"You don't have a house?"
"You are indeed at the Whites'."
"We'll return the favor."
"Believe me, please."
"What is happiness?"
"Are you a cop or what?"
"Do you mind if I come in?"
"You never told him?"
"I know, but it's important."
"Sorry, but I have to go."
"Do you have something to eat?"
"The ball is in our court."
"I took a look at it."
"He better be good."
"As we always have."
"That's where he works."
"Where did you get this idea from?"
"You just have to check."
"Have you ever used it?"
"Did he do it or not?"
"It's just a dress."
"Your people need you."
"Information is power."
"Your toys are really pretty."
"He said the same thing."
"It has never been seen before."
"I know, I saw her."
"I'll get you a coffee."
"You can't talk about it."
"I tried to calm him down."
"He wants to tell you something."
"I don't want details."
"I'm going to make myself a coffee."
"I knew you were here."
"I'm willing to bet on it."
"He had to go home."
"Well, I did it."
"I did it with pleasure."
"I guess that's normal."
"Go get me some ice cream."
"I'll see you next week."
"I have the right to an explanation."
"She gave me her number."
"It's a question of balance."
"I know she loves me."
"I thought we were done."
"It's the end of the beans."
"It was a whim."
"He must be here somewhere."
"Have you ever been to Paris?"
"I can take care of her."
"It happens from time to time."
"The end of year ball."
"This is what I'm looking for."
"Maybe it was written."
"I think he's hungry."
"Haven't you seen the movie?"
"At least, I don't think so."
"No, there was nothing."
"I'm telling you."
"It's time for us to go."
"I raise my glass to that."
"You did it all by yourself."
"They said it on the news."
"I like to hear you say it."
"They take him to the hospital."
"You do what you can."
"My men jumped after me."
"We must be able to address this subject."
"Maybe I could talk to him."
"You didn't warn him?"
"I want to do things right."
"I'm fed up with everything."
"She just had a baby."
"I like his way of thinking."
"The pleasure will be all mine."
"He's blindfolded, isn't he?"
"I always wanted to be a cop."
"I know her better than you."
"We are glad to see you."
"What color was her hair?"
"You may have seen her."
"There is still one."
"The big day is coming soon."
"I saw the light on."
"How did it get here?"
"We waited all day."
"I read about it."
"Did he give you anything?"
"We might be onto something."
"I need a consultation."
"What kind of music do you like?"
"I have to wash my hair."
"Do what makes you happy."
"I've never tried this."
"It happened all of a sudden."
"Is that lipstick?"
"You always think with your stomach."
"Can you bring some water?"
"You didn't tell me anything."
"If there is anything I can do."
"I need my son."
"Well, you paid, I give."
"It was as simple as that."
"I wondered where he was."
"I remember my mother."
"Can you show me the way?"
"We are going in the right direction."
"You have to be nice to me."
"You don't know where he is?"
"Do you understand what they are saying?"
"I'll say whatever you want."
"Stay calm and don't move."
"Please follow me, I beg you."
"Everything you've done."
"It looks ready."
"She agrees with me."
"She didn't do anything to you."
"They did their best."
"Do you know what I'm looking at?"
"Of course you love him."
"It's well and truly over."
"But you don't know anything about it."
"It's a treasure map."
"Thanks for coming, guys."
"You've been brainwashed."
"You have no say."
"I can give you the money."
"Don't try to follow me."
"There are side effects."
"What's this thing worth?"
"Come down, show me your safe conduct."
"Say, can you see my eyes?"
"I have to think about my future."
"I thought you wanted to bet."
"She looks good to me."
"We provide service to the community."
"We'll see how much you have."
"I found you a bird."
"Can we ask you a few questions?"
"Did you go to school?"
"I feel at home here."
"Yes, when you know the system."
"I want you to meet him."
"Do you like seafood?"
"I think that will be all."
"He can do other things."
"Have you seen a lone sniper?"
"There could be more."
"Look what I'm bringing you."
"Do you think it's important?"
"Of course I'm going."
"The eighth will be the first."
"I still have a lot of work to do."
"Oh my God, you're right."
"This isn't a bluff?"
"I just need you."
"It looks like a thieves' market."
"I don't expect anything in return."
"Honey, what happened?"
"Let's look on the bright side."
"Places he had been."
"Thank you for giving me this chance."
"You remind me of her."
"Come with me, if you want."
"No, no, I'll take care of it."
"A little grain to become strong."
"My little princess, come to your senses."
"What if it was your son?"
"We are very proud of him."
"Give my regards to your wife."
"Anyone else want some?"
"Did you bring me a present?"
"Don't like flying?"
"The mothership is ours."
"There was something new."
"What else could I say?"
"Same as last time."
"We have the circus guy."
"There are so many people."
"You played me."
"How can I make amends?"
"Are you doing well at school?"
"Is this the boat from the movie?"
"I don't have any other."
"Take her here before dark."
"Wait, I have a double call."
"Because you are my brother."
"Yes, it's gold."
"I'm as surprised as you are."
"I think I should leave."
"What is she waiting for?"
"We found her like that."
"I would like to speak to my wife."
"You're still in love with her."
"He is one of them."
"Do you want to be friends?"
"What are you doing in these hills?"
"I have been married three times."
"Barry was treated with great courtesy."
"I have a competitive spirit."
"Are you holding a salon or are you buying?"
"It made me very happy."
"It's Brandon's birthday."
"You will listen to me very carefully."
"Try not to think about it."
"Can I have a new cup?"
"It'll take us an hour."
"It's a gunshot."
"I know you can talk."
"I entered through the window."
"Why are you in my unit?"
"You have no pride?"
"What's coming up?"
"I know it's there."
"You might even be smart."
"I want you to kiss me."
"Your little godmother of my two?"
"Tell me who you work for."
"I am a very busy man."
"She has nothing to say."
"Let's see what we can see."
"We'll meet on the beach."
"I appreciate you coming."
"You better go back."
"It's a very good movie."
"Was it like the mouse?"
"Haven't you thought about that?"
"No, you are not happy."
"This is your point of view."
"May the gods be with you."
"No, I just made it up."
"I sent you a message."
"I had a lovely evening."
"For a few days or for a while."
"He spoke about the Black Pearl."
"I only see one."
"He'll be there in a minute."
"The whole town knows about it."
"Let me take care of her."
"Anywhere, but not here."
"I have to find a way."
"I have to explain something to you."
"I think it should be fine."
"I take back what is mine."
"Hey, do you want to see something?"
"Maybe we'll take a vacation."
"She is a very beautiful girl."
"What do you want him to do?"
"I came to see someone."
"No time to think."
"I think he loves me."
"You've gone to great lengths."
"I make myself comfortable."
"I have a job to finish."
"Thank you very much for inviting us."
"You'll see it soon enough."
"I'll do it with you."
"She is a very beautiful woman."
"It was great to see you again."
"He opened my eyes."
"I do what I say."
"But the law is the law."
"You don't have the key?"
"You have to do this for me."
"I know who I am now."
"Too many lives are at stake."
"I went to Atlantic City."
"When I get out, I'll be rich."
"Place your order and I'll deliver."
"Do you want to play fetch?"
"All prisoners, return to their cells."
"I'm here every day."
"He is smarter than me."
"I don't know anything about her."
"There, with the shopping bag."
"You need to go to the police."
"She's gone for good."
"I've done all genres."
"He was thought to be on drugs."
"He made me an offer."
"Can't we choose our color?"
"Whose number is this?"
"He disappeared from circulation."
"You can never be sure."
"The witness may sit down."
"I had to see it."
"Are these friends of yours?"
"Everyone on the field."
"And a map for your journey."
"Do what you want to me."
"This is my masterpiece."
"No, you weren't."
"I've made hundreds of them."
"I took the first step."
"Outside, there are the yellow pages."
"Was he a friend of yours?"
"I took her home."
"I spend my days with them."
"I've never had that."
"I'm going to feed him."
"They take what they find."
"She never said anything."
"Sorry to be so late."
"This is a step forward."
"You had plenty of time."
"Take some time to think about it."
"I risked everything for you."
"What would become of her?"
"Look where that got us."
"Your brother told me."
"Nothing is known about her."
"Of course I know her."
"This lawyer is calling me from Texas."
"You don't have a girlfriend?"
"Take me, please."
"Maybe he'll keep it."
"She'll be here in a moment."
"Since the age of thirteen."
"She wrote me a letter."
"I know what you think."
"It's you she wants."
"The rest will come little by little."
"What if she's too busy?"
"A northwest wind is blowing."
"I spoke to a lawyer."
"We may have a witness."
"Do you know where she comes from?"
"I need more light."
"We'll teach you respect."
"No, don't change the subject."
"Then we put on the black hood."
"I was made for this program."
"Yeah, I told you."
"White and Pink, one car each."
"What does it cost?"
"I requested armored support."
"It will take a day or two."
"Can you introduce us there?"
"Go ahead, you can do it."
"For what it means."
"Thank you very much, but I have to go."
"Breakfast will be ready."
"I guess that's good."
"How many people can say that?"
"It's solid money."
"A bachelor party."
"She wasn't herself."
"I'm going to go get some coffee."
"Because I'm your wife."
"This is my moment of glory."
"Nobody knows about Mr. Blue?"
"If only it were that easy."
"Sounds interesting to me."
"It's a man's job."
"Can we stay in your wheel?"
"What else do I need to know?"
"Say whatever you want."
"Let go of me, please."
"It's been a great year."
"On the salvation of your soul?"
"It's just a letter."
"As much as we can be."
"May all your dreams come true."
"I went to university."
"This is your Christmas present."
"It's a fundraiser."
"And it's a beautiful day."
"I know a lot about you."
"No one should continue this work."
"Do you remember this song?"
"I grew up in an orphanage."
"I want to go on a literary pilgrimage."
"That's kind of you, Captain."
"We moved on."
"You're overshadowing me."
"I need to get back in shape."
"Please be careful."
"Madam, is there anything I can do?"
"You're not answering your phone anymore?"
"I listen to it all the time."
"Yes, two years ago."
"Oh my God, that's true."
"Did your trip go well?"
"With ups and downs."
"Have you ever done it?"
"You're welcome, guys."
"I have to go to San Francisco."
"There have been changes."
"But this time it was different."
"No, we're not going."
"I have something to announce."
"Radio contact at the next checkpoint."
"What is done?"
"Where do you want him to go?"
"Just in time for dinner."
"He came from the future, too."
"He's a friend of mine."
"Maybe you should drink less."
"It's a very simple question."
"You're going to tell me the truth."
"Do something with your life."
"There is another girl."
"I can take care of you."
"Can you send him a message?"
"What does that do?"
"I'll tell Booth."
"I'll be done in a minute."
"What happened to Nora?"
"That was what was planned."
"There were cops everywhere."
"Do you want us to do it?"
"A symbol of peace, my Colonel."
"It's my wedding anniversary."
"I have to get there."
"No, there is little to do."
"I have them, I have them."
"He's a really nice boy."
"Nice Guy, we have a cop."
"Chess, a game of kings."
"The most beautiful woman in the world."
"I'll cheer you up."
"He's back in town."
"You're going to have to get used to it."
"Does she have a last name?"
"But what am I going to tell him?"
"What matters is us."
"You are a man of honor."
"Do you mind if I keep it?"
"It's more than a theory."
"You may have a concussion."
"You're a little comedian, aren't you?"
"I would like you to explain to me."
"My life is an open book."
"Haven't you read the newspapers?"
"How can I count on you?"
"I have someone else."
"We have some catching up to do."
"Maybe a little later."
"I was taken aback."
"I have a ton of work."
"She will be happy to see you."
"I'll give you one more chance."
"You would have found it on your own."
"See you at the ceremony."
"Tell that woman to come back."
"But it's the only way."
"No, I'm just saying."
"Someone called the cops."
"Do you believe in the Holy Virgin?"
"With Hank Williams records."
"You should have come earlier."
"Because he said so."
"Let me take care of everything."
"I saw a mouse go by."
"You can put me to work."
"I just wanted to give this to you."
"You haven't been followed?"
"No, we're not interested."
"She must not know."
"Did I get an x-ray?"
"There are plenty of them here."
"We both want it."
"It's just a box."
"I'm proud of you, man."
"Do you think he'll come?"
"I want to be your friend too."
"You're making fun of me again."
"It's mating season."
"She can't be."
"It's a matter of justice."
"No, I'm not anymore."
"I forgot to ask him."
"Who told you to come in?"
"How did you get into my house?"
"Have you ever had a dog?"
"Are you a girl or not?"
"I pray for the same thing."
"I want him to be there."
"I have a schedule to keep."
"You have had a long journey."
"But here, we're in business."
"Tell me you believe me."
"My dear friend, are you unharmed?"
"It can't be a coincidence."
"I thought you wanted it."
"What is it, little one?"
"It depends on who you ask."
"She's fine, she's fine."
"No, I will never do that."
"Where was it made?"
"Did he tell you his name?"
"You have to give it your all."
"I'll be ready in a minute."
"It looks like a circus mouse."
"I feel it in my bones."
"Is that what you have?"
"I see you're busy."
"It's your turn, Mr. Bond."
"A little more to the left."
"Let's not talk about that here."
"Don't feel sorry for me."
"You will leave like everyone else."
"I think we know each other."
"I have been married twice."
"Thanks, I owe you one."
"I was told the opposite."
"You have to take care of me."
"I need to talk to my son."
"You should have seen his face."
"There was no question of that."
"It's very simple, actually."
"I hope so, for your sake."
"Please take me."
"In my opinion, it's simple."
"It's getting better and better."
"They are heading north."
"There are loads of them."
"This is to make up for it."
"I need to search you."
"The Last Judgment was prevented."
"It is a security measure."
"It must be around here."
"He is a very important client."
"Just what we needed."
"You are part of a brotherhood."
"I think I heard something."
"Go wait for me in the car."
"I'm going to spend the night here."
"Do you want to join forces?"
"How about we go have a drink?"
"The Black Pearl is yours."
"You need a bath."
"I have people to see."
"I'm the boss now."
"I heard the same thing."
"She is younger than me."
"There are rules here."
"He played me."
"She never married."
"And what did you talk about?"
"Boss, I need to talk to you."
"The accounts are in his name."
"I'm keeping an eye on you."
"But you're in luck."
"He did the same with me."
"Come to the bathroom."
"It's a retirement home."
"Well, what do we have here?"
"I mean, I love you."
"I take my work seriously."
"It's his way of being."
"It always happens like this."
"I really love you, you know."
"I wish you a lot of fun."
"But I promise you one thing."
"Is that what you were doing?"
"I hope it suits you."
"I don't have the answers."
"He will have an answer for you."
"Mind your language, in my block."
"That's it for tonight."
"He never came here."
"You have to think about your future."
"Who is this charming young girl?"
"Where did he put it?"
"How would he train it?"
"I came for work."
"And Lee Harvey Oswald, do you know him?"
"How far are we from D.C.?"
"It seemed okay."
"This decision is not yours."
"It's because I love you."
"I'm here, everything's fine."
"I wouldn't worry about it."
"Maybe more, maybe less."
"She invited us to dinner."
"Do you want to hear some good news?"
"Didn't you see the sign?"
"That time is over."
"I understand what you are doing."
"We'll see you another day."
"No, I don't know you."
"Would you like a glass of sherry?"
"We'll find you something."
"Your mother is in the hospital."
"I thought it would be okay."
"I want us to get along."
"It's bigger than expected."
"I expected this answer."
"An hour, an hour and a half."
"She was my grandmother's."
"It belonged to my grandmother."
"Only what you bring to it."
"I brought you some books."
"He's smarter than me."
"For once in your life."
"And what happened to you?"
"No, she'll go with the Spaniard."
"Did anyone else know?"
"Request immediate intervention of an armored vehicle."
"I have a telegram for you."
"You think I knew that?"
"How can you stay so calm?"
"I need you, Mom."
"It makes sense to me."
"There is something behind it."
"The doors will open soon."
"I had another one."
"Something will have to be done."
"So, what is it about?"
"The prisons are starting to fill up."
"I never saw them again."
"I have little choice."
"This is a very good story."
"He taught him the alphabet."
"I hope you will be happy."
"I have thousands of players."
"I knew he would make it."
"What did you come here to do?"
"No, he doesn't have it."
"You didn't want to go?"
"It seemed like an eternity."
"They say you're cold."
"It was much more than that."
"Have you seen Dr. Bishop?"
"It's a birthmark."
"If I could have your attention."
"I'd like some coffee, please."
"It's a kind of tradition."
"You say that all the time."
"No, you would keep me for yourself."
"Hey, how did it go?"
"You will give me your word."
"Tell him it's you."
"What would become of me?"
"It's stronger than us."
"I have a lot of boyfriends."
"One bonus bullet per lover."
"They are above us."
"I brought you your lunch."
"Something must have happened to him."
"Let's see what he'll do."
"Douglas, take her back to her room."
"But the first ones were waiting for us."
"But it's the only solution."
"Do you remember the second wave?"
"I was young at the time."
"I have a runny nose."
"Turn around and look at the lady."
"I took one on Friday."
"Do you have one for me?"
"I'll find you one."
"Haven't you heard it?"
"Don't turn your back on him."
"I'll leave you to your own devices."
"Burt, you have a visitor."
"No, but it won't be long."
"You were born older."
"It's the inside that counts."
"I sent him a message."
"There are people everywhere."
"Who is your group leader?"
"I'm going to read you a story."
"In the crowd, in solitude."
"There are still some here."
"Everyone to the cellar."
"I'll have them for you tomorrow."
"Do you have a credit card?"
"Sooner or later he will speak."
"No, we're not married."
"It's a farewell gift."
"I want you both."
"Will there be a next time?"
"I have a question too."
"But you're lucky."
"There's something on it."
"What do I tell them about Dad?"
"You've known it from the beginning."
"You are now a Kappa sister."
"That won't do."
"It's the next one on the right."
"There was a battle."
"Do you know who this belongs to?"
"It's heaven on earth."
"Are you calling my friend a faggot?"
"Praise God you are here."
"I think it's perfect."
"You just said the opposite."
"I know what it says."
"I had nothing to do."
"I don't remember, Colonel."
"Can you take care of that?"
"Same as the others."
"We both know it."
"No, they're here to chat."
"I just want her back."
"It is good for neuro."
"They are like everyone else."
"These are tears of joy."
"I'm going to do more than that."
"We still need you."
"You don't have any change?"
"And I will obtain justice for my father."
"I think it will heal."
"I knew they would."
"Tell him not to come."
"Is everyone on board?"
"I'm going to take a walk outside."
"Hey, what happened?"
"Are you sure you want this?"
"You didn't tell them anything?"
"What will happen to you?"
"How did the work go?"
"My father told him that."
"It's compressed air."
"You only have one minute."
"He should be here this morning."
"I know it was hard."
"And it's for life."
"I think she's hungry."
"Ace saw Vegas his way."
"So that your action is beautiful."
"Let's go, it's good."
"What do you want him to say?"
"I liked it, I would like to continue."
"There it is, I see it."
"When things go wrong, who do they call?"
"You're going to make fun of me."
"What you always wanted."
"You're the one who doesn't understand."
"This will be my wedding present."
"I don't think I am."
"You haven't left yet?"
"This is my cell phone number."
"I want to talk to him in person."
"Glad to have you back with us."
"No, this is not the time."
"My beautiful only loves me."
"That was all there was to it."
"Yes, everyone knows that."
"It's happening right now."
"I hope that's it."
"I take it to my office."
"How could this have happened?"
"I am pleased to do so."
"Did he tell you about that?"
"What if it's too late?"
"Of course, like everyone else."
"Do you know who she looked like?"
"I need to be here."
"Who had this brilliant idea?"
"What I told you."
"I have something to finish."
"I knew he was there."
"Who saw him last?"
"I know you tried."
"Actually, I wanted to talk to you."
"I've been here for a while."
"What did you have?"
"It's half mine."
"There are lots of things."
"Do you want to go to the beach?"
"I admire what you do."
"I was glad to see you again."
"You want to stay with this guy."
"Looks like it's me."
"She seems fine."
"You never loved him."
"What if she doesn't come back?"
"We do this every day."
"I hope I can do it."
"Do you want to keep all the potatoes?"
"Maybe we'll find something."
"Do you want me to do that?"
"We did well to come."
"Have you seen this before?"
"Boss, what's going on?"
"I thought he was joking."
"You're worth the wait."
"I need to talk to this man."
"I hope you're having fun."
"No cops in the temple."
"You look more beautiful than ever."
"That's your point of view."
"He agrees with me."
"You're the one I wanted."
"Don't you want to stay here?"
"We are having dinner."
"Something must be going on."
"What are you going to do about it?"
"You only hear my voice."
"Perhaps the time has come."
"God knows what he's doing."
"It wasn't mine."
"You are doing the right thing."
"We are in the central network."
"What if I don't sign?"
"I want to see him."
"The law is on our side."
"We're both here."
"I'm here to talk to you."
"You have to promise me one thing."
"You're not talking about me?"
"They didn't find it."
"Can we simulate cerebral flow?"
"I'm from the forensics department."
"Do you know any happily married couples?"
"These people threatened my family."
"But it's for the best."
"We are both the same."
"You got a good deal."
"I was trained for this."
"Can I ask your name?"
"I have lots of friends."
"Do I look like this?"
"Is there a cure?"
"She went back to her mother's house."
"I'll get rid of him."
"I want to take care of her."
"Just a moment, I'll pass it to you."
"Have you talked to your parents?"
"The big vegetable of this kitchen."
"Do what you think is right."
"You want to see his balls fry."
"Should I put this on an account?"
"Did someone call for me?"
"Are you taking care of the car?"
"Who taught you to drive?"
"I told you so, right?"
"They leave Middle-earth."
"I heard you in there."
"I remember this story."
"Can we talk to you for a minute?"
"Can you give us an example?"
"Come on, I'll introduce her to you."
"But we had a lot of fun."
"All roads lead to Rome."
"I thought you would be pleased."
"Pass on what you have learned."
"It's nothing exceptional."
"Of course I came."
"The children need you."
"Yes, in fact you remember."
"This is my pet."
"Yes, a few years ago."
"The long-awaited moment has arrived."
"Can't you talk to him?"
"We have our say."
"It's completely normal."
"You know I like that."
"How can you let him decide?"
"I was on a business trip."
"I see you're feeling better."
"What will it look like?"
"I have a very good reason."
"I've been watching you for a while."
"I have them all the time."
"He comes here every day."
"I think I'll walk."
"I have to go back inside."
"Maybe you should think about it."
"This is the moment of truth."
"Greta made you a sandwich."
"He will be happy when he comes home."
"Haven't you guessed yet?"
"I hope you get better."
"Maybe they have a dog."
"It taught me a lesson."
"That's what we say."
"No, you weren't there."
"I left you something."
"Do you think you're my mother?"
"Isn't that right, my son?"
"Actually, it's quite simple."
"You know I'm telling the truth."
"I haven't seen him since."
"I advise you to go there."
"He just needs rest."
"We are together all the time."
"She went shopping."
"This is what she said."
"You had to know that."
"He comes from a good family."
"How do you say 'planque' in French?"
"But I digress."
"There is someone there."
"I told them about you."
"What if you get caught?"
"That's what I would like."
"We're done with this."
"We'll go whenever you want."
"I know what you're up to."
"He had a golden opportunity."
"I'm just a passenger."
"I had a visitor."
"That's it, I remember."
"He has a thing for you."
"A towel, please."
"Can you tell me something?"
"This is one of the best."
"I talk to him all the time."
"Don't you remember him?"
"See what condition he is in."
"Can I go like this?"
"The neighbors came back so suddenly."
"How did you get here so fast?"
"Everyone will tell you."
"No, we can't enter."
"It will never be the same again."
"I had nothing to say."
"I'll take care of your luggage."
"Since when do you talk like that?"
"I can go by myself."
"I can go there by myself."
"Hopefully they'll make it through the night."
"God bless you for the coffee."
"I'm coming to check on you."
"Why did you bring her here?"
"Did you look towards the car?"
"Signals as big as your arm."
"You don't have a brother."
"Do you take me for a thief?"
"You must not touch it."
"She went to her mother's house."
"There are other methods."
"They will be here in two days."
"Yes, what is it about?"
"Have they left?"
"I'll be the first to enter."
"You took my son from me."
"Can I have some beer?"
"What if she doesn't want to?"
"You know what I wish for?"
"Where do we sign?"
"It's over, it's going to be okay."
"You and I are going to talk."
"You have to tell me more."
"Don't come to San Francisco."
"I want to get out of the country."
"I'm still the same person."
"It's okay, it's me."
"Drop that right now."
"I'll have a word with him about it."
"Go to the waiting room."
"And there are many."
"I erased all the fingerprints."
"I'll call you in the morning."
"You should be with your family."
"The plane leaves in an hour."
"You are part of my life."
"She's one of my patients."
"I've loved you for so long."
"Are you asking me the question straight out?"
"Dad knows what he's doing."
"You have until tomorrow morning."
"But you have to be ready."
"We're making headlines."
"I'm telling you this like this."
"What do you mean exactly?"
"It's because of the weather."
"See you in two weeks."
"What if you stayed this time?"
"Whose phone is this?"
"They say I look like him."
"Can I sit closer?"
"This is for my girlfriend."
"You have had a serious accident."
"Are you at the end of your rope?"
"Maybe we should split up."
"I know you do."
"Nobody tells me what to do."
"Do you know who she was talking to?"
"What is this story?"
"I guess you are confident."
"I was the only one who knew."
"No, I didn't see anyone."
"No, you don't like him."
"Everything we did."
"I'll be there in half an hour."
"You promised me an audience."
"Who did you tell?"
"You have to do it for me."
"I suspected something."
"You don't watch TV?"
"I worked all day."
"I wonder what it's like."
"It's a part of me."
"She has her feet on the ground."
"You can watch if you want."
"I wonder where they are going."
"Send a car, install a device."
"Don't you know the rules?"
"You've had a long journey."
"Thank you for taking me back to town."
"I chose it myself."
"Tell her we miss her."
"You will always be in my heart."
"I have something to take."
"You'll be safer here."
"I should have come to see you."
"It kept me awake."
"This is a chance for us."
"It was sold to the highest bidder."
"I want us to find him."
"He always brought me luck."
"Orders come from above."
"Have you read all these books?"
"Once you have paid."
"Who's on the other end of the line?"
"It's early for Las Vegas."
"It's haute couture."
"Do you remember your name?"
"Wine, please."
"Is it you they want?"
"What was he doing in your hip?"
"At the casino, she was a queen."
"On the other side of the park."
"I remember that moment."
"I wish you a lot of luck."
"I have a long way to go."
"I've only just started."
"Because he's a man."
"We focus on the Zone."
"He can support his request."
"I have a cop on horseback."
"I learned about it this morning."
"Are you a friend of hers?"
"We'll see you another time."
"I know what it takes."
"She is in a nursing home."
"It's up to us to do the same."
"I think it's ready."
"They must have sensed our presence."
"Can you take a picture of us?"
"He might be on vacation."
"But what can be done about it?"
"I called him this morning."
"I knew he would like it."
"I just want to say one thing."
"You'll get it next time."
"They did what they wanted."
"Let him know I'm here."
"Do you want me to shut up?"
"I hear what you're saying."
"Do you want a glass of milk?"
"I heard that somewhere."
"Do you get along well with him?"
"He is older than me."
"But I will do my best."
"And you, where are you from?"
"You are a good little girl."
"No one will take you seriously."
"You need money."
"All I can do."
"They all needed him."
"You have always been the guardian."
"It's liquid nitrogen."
"We did it for the kids."
"She did it for you."
"I need you too."
"Do you know how I feel?"
"You know how I feel?"
"It is made of liquid metal."
"Do you want me to spy on him?"
"I was called all the time."
"What did we believe?"
"We'll get them next time."
"Nicky dreamed of another Vegas."
"Maybe because of the headlights."
"And Blue, have you seen him?"
"We have known each other since childhood."
"He came back to life."
"I have my advance coming."
"You don't want to marry me anymore?"
"We have the lab results."
"Tell me you know."
"Yeah, he told me."
"The police are on the case."
"I forgot to introduce myself."
"That's what's exciting."
"For what you have done."
"I'll get you something."
"I know that's it."
"In the center of the entrance hall."
"Yes, we know who you are."
"I want us to stay together."
"A wonderful thing happened."
"Well, I found it."
"Didn't we tell you?"
"That is the whole question."
"I think you would like it."
"They must have landed with you."
"Please, for me."
"Abe has a unique frontal lobe."
"No, I didn't recognize him."
"Do you want to have breakfast?"
"Please, let's go."
"No, I'll do it myself."
"Put the money in the bag."
"I want you to meet her."
"I want you to hear this."
"That's where I'll be."
"Do you believe in love at first sight?"
"He's leaving the hospital tomorrow."
"Social housing, concrete cages."
"Who has time for that?"
"You didn't ask for it."
"I said that randomly."
"Do you want me to follow him?"
"We'll call you a taxi."
"Do you know who I work for?"
"I want to talk to your father."
"But you need me."
"You have to invite me in."
"Are you happy to see me?"
"And the rest of the crew?"
"He's there right now."
"That's it, I got it."
"I know you have them."
"So he knows where you are."
"I'll show you your bed."
"You know what we do?"
"Our Father who art in heaven."
"Do you feel me in your gut?"
"It came suddenly."
"Do you know where the toilets are?"
"It's worth it, I hope."
"You have something to do."
"You think it was me?"
"It's a girls' night out."
"I hope you enjoyed it."
"My wife and I are separated."
"Do you want to talk about something else?"
"I'll take you wherever you want."
"But we brought him back down."
"Will you be there for my birthday?"
"I think I know where to start."
"But that was last night."
"Do you want to measure yourself against me?"
"But she made you laugh."
"Give me a call."
"You never know who's listening."
"In a box, in my office."
"I thought I heard someone."
"They haven't arrived yet."
"It happened all by itself."
"It's as you feel."
"Tell me how it happened."
"You have to press the button."
"Do I have your consent to act?"
"There was a knock at the door."
"I was proud of my sentence."
"What if we leave here?"
"You've got yourself all mixed up there."
"I was heartbroken."
"I know you think so."
"Let's give him what he wants."
"There are women here."
"Nobody cares about me."
"I'll get you a blanket."
"You're not sure."
"It's easier for me."
"And I let her do it."
"How are you feeling, my dear?"
"Do you remember this girl?"
"It's him, is it sure?"
"I have to get back to L.A."
"Do you want me to wake up?"
"Who asked you to come?"
"Brothers protect each other."
"The time has come to choose."
"Don't you hear a little girl, Frankie?"
"I've had it since this morning."
"You know what I love?"
"Okay, I'll be right there."
"It's like in life."
"It's part of your charm."
"It's our lot."
"I think I found the solution."
"You look so cute."
"I need to see them."
"I need to go."
"Can you lower your voice?"
"See you in two days."
"Phone number of the cabin?"
"And there always will be."
"By the way, what's your name?"
"Of course I believe it."
"Every divorced woman has the right to it."
"I need a nitrogen kit."
"I don't know, it depends."
"It's better not to know."
"He is the king of what?"
"It's the present that matters."
"Because you are a man."
"And you, how do you feel?"
"The keys, please."
"Does it really work?"
"I'm right on time."
"I'll take you for a ride."
"In a morgue here in Paris."
"Do you do this all the time?"
"I'm lucky, huh?"
"I have a delivery to make."
"Do you want to go to my room?"
"No one is ever safe."
"It just happened like that."
"Children, what are you doing here?"
"They haven't decided yet."
"I spoke to my lawyer."
"Blessed be the name of the Lord."
"Right place, right time."
"I can go on all day."
"He must be in his room."
"Equips the military clubs of the colonies."
"Because I told them."
"Please call me."
"Did she tell you something?"
"Not one to catch the other."
"I could have done without it."
"I was put under a spell."
"You have a very beautiful smile."
"I've thought about your suggestion."
"You go to a lot of places."
"Honey, go wait for me outside."
"There is plenty to do."
"I was sent after him."
"What is left to say?"
"Are you seasick?"
"Have you cleaned the room yet?"
"I'm one step ahead."
"An admirable woman, that's for sure."
"I don't know this girl."
"I've seen it done before."
"Something I said?"
"What is he drinking?"
"But what happened to him?"
"I like men in uniform."
"Someone gave it to you."
"It's up to her to decide, right?"
"Since when has he disappeared?"
"We did everything we could."
"He has plans for you."
"It's moonlight."
"Do you know what they're talking about?"
"Wait outside, please."
"It's in New Jersey."
"It's her honeymoon."
"I call it what I want."
"What is she up to?"
"There are other reasons."
"I don't want him anymore."
"I've been doing this for years."
"He is a childhood friend."
"It's written on your badge."
"Can you give him a message?"
"All living things look alike."
"They will believe he is there."
"Call me as soon as he arrives."
"If you still want me."
"A Coke, please."
"She headed straight to the office."
"This is what we found."
"There is much to be gained."
"Yes, that's the correct address."
"It was just for one day."
"We've come a long way together."
"I want what's mine."
"In public, I believe in everyone."
"He reminds me of my grandfather."
"And when did you see me?"
"Who are you talking to down there?"
"I want a paternity test."
"This is one of our favorites."
"I want to take you somewhere."
"Not if they feel threatened."
"That's what you feel."
"How did the exam go?"
"I will open the door for you."
"How do you manage to do that?"
"I called you about that."
"We take matters into our own hands."
"I can't control her."
"Don't pressure me."
"So what happened to him?"
"They haven't come out yet."
"What does she open?"
"You got me out of trouble."
"It was for a good cause."
"I agree with Stu."
"I can't forgive him."
"I'll write you a prescription."
"But it has to work."
"There has been a break-in."
"He looks very nice."
"You're unlucky."
"Is it charged?"
"I paid for your breakfast."
"Once or twice a week."
"There is so much to see."
"You never said it."
"What would it look like?"
"Things are as they are."
"You have to try it."
"What is he taking?"
"No, no, it's okay, it's okay."
"I have a business to propose."
"Do you have the balance sheet, Lt?"
"I have to go, goodbye."
"I think he would like it."
"Your name, what were you looking for?"
"We have a job for you."
"I know where the key is."
"Oh yes, I'm sure."
"Thanks for putting me here."
"I took care of you."
"He is stronger than you."
"What are you guys talking about?"
"I know who you really are."
"This platform is off-limits to civilians."
"It seems you are looking for me."
"We are here to protect you."
"The Games Brigade is everywhere."
"I was there all the time."
"The last act makes the film."
"Sorry I didn't tell you anything."
"But what is this thing?"
"You won the jackpot."
"Maybe he's gone."
"Sorry, I forgot your name."
"When were you planning to tell me about this?"
"I know you are here."
"There is gold."
"Here, put this in your pocket."
"I assure you, it's true."
"Where is my hairbrush?"
"No, it doesn't work like that."
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"Everyone knows me here."
"Do you have an idea in mind?"
"Would you like to join us?"
"I am proud of all of you."
"I know you loved him."
"What else can we be?"
"I have no defense."
"He is very proud of you."
"It's been over a month."
"So we go home."
"How convenient for him."
"It's for an appointment."
"You don't even talk to each other anymore."
"Say it a million times."
"I'm watching it right now."
"Doc, where is the shooter?"
"You both look pretty."
"That was about it."
"It can only please him."
"It's like home."
"Do you need a lawyer?"
"Yeah, you might be right."
"Why are you worrying?"
"Don Ward is very well liked here."
"She's the one who left."
"I'll pour you a drink."
"Why are you interested in him?"
"Where was she from, Compton?"
"We should see each other more often."
"Because it doesn't exist."
"Everything else is up to you."
"They did something to me."
"No, I want to be with you."
"Something is going to happen to you."
"No, I've made my decision."
"Can't hold back?"
"What does she need?"
"What did he do to me?"
"Don't call me that anymore."
"Come have a drink with us."
"There must be a door."
"In the name of Jesus we pray."
"There are tuxedos and there are tuxedos."
"We are on alert."
"I see you know each other."
"I have his cell phone number."
"More beautiful than ever, big sister."
"Did you put gas in?"
"Does this make sense?"
"I want to be on time."
"It's time to sort this out."
"I'll take one for myself."
"I'll leave the field open to you."
"He was good to me."
"I have a very good memory."
"This is not an opinion."
"The director is something else."
"Think of something pleasant."
"I'll find out who did this."
"I saw her last night."
"Do you have a room to rent?"
"And the kitchen on your left."
"Are those gunshots?"
"What if he was telling the truth?"
"When were you going to tell me about it?"
"No, it's fine, it's okay."
"She's not upstairs."
"He's smarter than that."
"Open it and give it to me."
"Actually, it's mine."
"How long can you hold on?"
"Did he stand you up?"
"Please, calm down."
"It can happen anytime."
"I know where I belong."
"Sorry, visit another time."
"Where did you learn this poem?"
"Do you want me to hide?"
"But you owe me one."
"It's about him."
"Did you have a good summer?"
"Someone else will do it."
"She knows we're here."
"I discovered it this morning."
"I made you win big."
"I need an alibi."
"I think he knows that."
"Sorry for what happened."
"I have to go to the dentist."
"Is this store yours?"
"It's the best of all possible worlds."
"I don't belong here."
"Hey, I got your message."
"But not by selling secrets."
"How could you think that?"
"I know what they are."
"Apparently it's good."
"I feel it, I feel it."
"You never loved her."
"The keys are in my pocket."
"I'll try it in the kitchen."
"I want to tell you."
"See how easy that was?"
"You're really talking nonsense."
"I'm proud of you, honey."
"She's not for me."
"You'll have it next week."
"You want to know where I was?"
"I tried to reason with her."
"It seems to be stopping."
"But he's a good boy."
"No one can survive this."
"What do you have your eye on?"
"She gave me the key."
"He loved you like a son."
"I wonder who it was."
"Here, drink some water."
"I'm starting to see things clearly."
"You don't want to go back?"
"How do you want this to work?"
"No, I have too much work."
"I just feel it."
"I came to get my things."
"It's not drugs."
"He is happy to see you."
"He knew what kind of man you would become."
"I left her there."
"You used her."
"I understand what you are going through."
"Is this serious?"
"You should never do that."
"You look like you're going to throw up."
"Do you have feelings for her?"
"Just the ones you give me."
"There are a lot of cars."
"Shall I walk you to your car?"
"I found out this morning."
"No, that's not correct."
"We'll be there for tea."
"I almost shot you."
"He lives in another world."
"I take care of the press."
"Do we really have to talk about this?"
"No, everyone loved him."
"It had to happen."
"Let's see if I get an address."
"I need to have a drink."
"How am I going to get out of this?"
"I need your services."
"Haven't you changed your mind?"
"I was next to him."
"You don't believe in ghosts?"
"What can you do for me?"
"You can't think that."
"He's a man, a real one."
"Now you."
"Where is the ransom demand?"
"I told him what to do."
"Your father was a great man."
"I never knew her."
"She's on the other line."
"Is this Doug's mattress?"
"You have a job to do."
"She didn't come here."
"What did you think it was?"
"We are very close to the goal."
"I sent her flowers."
"Tell him to come see me."
"What do you see coming for you?"
"I had to make a decision."
"Yes, that's my real name."
"I gave him the day off."
"So you're talking nonsense."
"He is younger than me."
"Won't you buy me a drink?"
"I will be back very soon."
"Who is in charge of the case?"
"I'm starting to feel better."
"Did the team get their share?"
"I know, I'll take care of it."
"I saw your lightsaber."
"They never did."
"Did you go through my bag?"
"I have lucky pills."
"I must be punished."
"Something just happened."
"It's all my business now."
"I'm going to surprise him."
"I'll be right back, okay?"
"I gave him a name."
"You'll have to do better than that."
"No one has heard of it."
"What a beautiful job you did."
"You've seen through me."
"It's a woman."
"What else are they used for?"
"Well, that looks good."
"They asked who you were?"
"I thought you'd like that."
"It's still a little early."
"Nature abhors a vacuum."
"Can we do something about it?"
"Did you see him this morning?"
"Do you want to come up for a drink?"
"You've gotten ahead of yourself."
"Maybe he's a cop."
"It went well, huh?"
"You know I am."
"But what would I do there?"
"We have to take him to the hospital."
"Everyone has a father."
"Is that what you like?"
"But how did he do it?"
"Because I really love you."
"She only talks about that."
"It's time to get ready."
"You look good to me."
"You have something special."
"You don't like women?"
"I came to return this to you."
"I will try to reach him."
"You are just like everyone else."
"Do you want a ride?"
"I was on television."
"Everything you will need."
"Who is in charge of the investigation?"
"I can't, guys."
"I have a lot of free time."
"It's in both your names."
"Do you promise not to say anything?"
"Do you want a cereal bar?"
"There is one now."
"I did a little research."
"She knows what I'm talking about."
"They have already experienced war."
"He needs his medication."
"She didn't want to say anything."
"I always tell you the truth."
"A world united and at peace."
"And now what are you going to do?"
"Whose all this is?"
"You know where the bar is."
"You hide in broad daylight."
"They are both here."
"And yet you defended him."
"Let's see what I can find."
"I'm clean, you know that."
"I look forward to reading from you."
"Haven't you seen them?"
"The Guardians are a thing of the past."
"I always liked him."
"You must trust me."
"Look like you're having fun."
"It will be a bloodbath."
"Someone else is needed."
"What do you want them to do?"
"Do you have a driver's license?"
"Would you please please me?"
"He is suspected in the robbery."
"Because you're hiding it from him."
"I can buy you, sell you."
"How long can we hold out?"
"Who left the door open?"
"I have many friends here."
"What would you be able to do?"
"It's good to be free."
"We have a new king now."
"In my soul, Italian cinema."
"But everything went well."
"I know you are close."
"No one can resist Rome."
"Don't hesitate to ask me."
"She didn't say no."
"Who disagrees?"
"No, I don't trust it."
"There is a lot of money."
"A real little genius in science."
"It is not a cure."
"But they are not there."
"I haven't left yet."
"But it's the same thing."
"I had an appointment with him."
"That's where they are."
"It's okay, I saw it."
"The whole world knows."
"I need two men."
"I turned my back on him."
"There are many things."
"He was right about you."
"We should take a step back."
"But a small party, OK?"
"You didn't need to."
"Would you like to leave him a message?"
"This is Colonel Douglas Mortimer."
"You know guns are circulating."
"What does this make you think of?"
"I'll come when I'm ready."
"You knew this was coming."
"You are doing a very good job."
"I want to go back to my cell."
"I have an offer for you."
"I want to open your eyes."
"It's a family story."
"Because you're taking that plane."
"I think I saw something."
"But you're not there yet."
"I want you to be."
"He was younger than me."
"What is your name, my dear?"
"He took my hand."
"I risk my life for you."
"She closed her bank account."
"You must have done something."
"How did you get here so quickly?"
"I have a life, you know."
"I would bet my life on it."
"Knowledge is power."
"I need to speak to your boss."
"Ray with his hockey stick."
"I thought you knew me."
"My wife is still expecting a child."
"I'll get a bowl first."
"There's a draft."
"Sorry for doubting you."
"How many people is this for?"
"Because he tells the truth."
"Did he tell you anything else?"
"What do you want from me exactly?"
"I am honored to meet you."
"We do it my way."
"Thanks for the call."
"Are you insured for life?"
"The world is really small here."
"I'll get through this on my own."
"What are you driving?"
"This is a very good start."
"I knew we would understand each other."
"You wanted to tell me something."
"It's because of work."
"Is everyone settled in?"
"I always wanted a child."
"They must have changed their minds."
"We received it this morning."
"What everyone wants."
"Do I have time to eat?"
"Don't ask me any more."
"No need to go into details."
"So, shall I take the wheel?"
"No, that won't do."
"No, don't tell me."
"What were you reading?"
"She must be around."
"I've heard this story before."
"Tell us a little about yourself."
"He never did that."
"You don't have a name?"
"Any idea who it is?"
"Have you ever seen a portal?"
"I don't have a story."
"A straight guy, like his father."
"This is what you should do."
"He's a very good boy."
"You'll have it on your conscience."
"I'll get her myself."
"I know almost everything about you."
"They are not all."
"We'll just take a look."
"How am I supposed to know?"
"Do you know what you're becoming?"
"I want to be more than that."
"I live here day and night."
"I was on the other side."
"Of course I'll come."
"I may have done it."
"It only happens in the movies."
"Maybe we could go there."
"It's plant-based."
"I want to know where he's going."
"It can only be you."
"I knew he would go far."
"You have domestic responsibilities."
"It will be up to you to decide."
"I have the marriage contract."
"This is the bedroom."
"I come here every day."
"He took hold of you."
"Come on, we're going to have fun."
"I'd love a cup of that."
"Let me give you my card."
"Isn't that your husband?"
"What does she say in her letter?"
"You don't have anything planned?"
"Brendan Harris passed the test."
"I think it's Frankie."
"Did you need to say that?"
"My mother left for Christmas."
"Do you see that tree over there?"
"Ask Polly to write them down."
"I'm glad you're back."
"I am a nice person."
"I gave him the evening off."
"I'm not even going to ask."
"We'll talk about it when I get back."
"That's kind of the point."
"I take care of the house."
"Because she had a lover."
"Of course he's fine."
"She will take you to the shrink."
"What excites you?"
"What do you know about life?"
"She was going to dinner with friends."
"We saw each other this morning."
"I feel better like this."
"We use the saw."
"But there is more important."
"I wanted to prepare some for myself."
"I owe them money."
"He has something to say."
"I thought everything was settled."
"And you, you call home."
"Is this a job interview?"
"I am not the father."
"Thank you for agreeing to see me."
"Is that not your opinion?"
"He gets that from his mother."
"It's better, it's better."
"We'll talk about it again when I get back."
"This is new to me too."
"They're stuck in your hair."
"We may be the last."
"There is still one more test."
"But let's not talk about that."
"I'll clear all that out."
"Let's start with something simple."
"What year were you born?"
"I am his unofficial photographer."
"We saw light."
"Do you want to go all the way?"
"I want you to keep this."
"Thank you for coming back for me."
"Who would have believed such a thing?"
"I never use it."
"Come on, I'll buy you a drink."
"I guess you know that."
"She won't last the night."
"He proposed to her."
"Yes, that rings a bell."
"He has a hangover."
"I left them a message."
"It's a boy's name."
"Be careful what you ask for."
"I will never speak to him again."
"But you're not anymore."
"You have to remember."
"No, I'm sure not."
"Can't we go somewhere else?"
"Turn around as soon as possible."
"And that's my last word."
"Do you know anything about electricity?"
"I see the face of God."
"You have a very special purpose."
"I've read a lot about you."
"Do you see this manhole cover?"
"Maybe I should do that."
"Now you know where he lives."
"Often, we learn to love it."
"I would like to ask you a favor."
"I just wanted to tell you that."
"And I must do the same."
"It rained all week."
"It has been closed for years."
"I want to know who they are."
"I'll leave him a message."
"Will we let them defend themselves?"
"You can forget about it."
"A man goes to the doctor."
"Take it off, please."
"Always there to watch over you."
"There must be a clue."
"That's it, let's go."
"The master must preserve his strength."
"Is it worth it?"
"Is that where they're going?"
"What are all these questions?"
"With the arrival of a new one?"
"Not even a phone call."
"Is there a solution?"
"Or we want to make people believe it."
"They never married."
"He is a very nice boy."
"I knew you would have it."
"Are there any other questions?"
"I'll borrow it for a second."
"I want to see what it's like."
"You were a good father."
"Do you remember your promise?"
"In the end, we collect everything."
"You told me to leave."
"Close your doors, go home."
"I think it's doable."
"We still have a lot to do."
"You need to take your mind off things."
"The Force is powerful within him."
"I think it's serious."
"The corner table is ready."
"There are a lot of children."
"Give them some time."
"But we got through it."
"What were we doing?"
"Did she give you any diseases?"
"That's the good life."
"No, it's quite the opposite."
"Maybe I should talk to him."
"How can he do this to me?"
"Or we'll never see each other again."
"I'll know more there."
"We'll meet at the station."
"But no one had seen anything."
"You've been saying that for years."
"Maybe I misheard."
"I'll come back tomorrow after work."
"I need the address."
"I have to lead my own life."
"I could have been someone."
"I have to read it."
"Do you know what they are?"
"I thought I could trust you."
"I'm going to go for a little walk."
"Uh, I'll be right back."
"We have our whole lives ahead of us."
"I am God's instrument."
"We live from day to day."
"Explain the blood stains to us."
"You don't love me now."
"He made advances towards me."
"You can be honest with me."
"I'm on the verge of tears."
"And to enjoy life."
"Celeste is a gift from heaven."
"Come see what I'm doing."
"Because I asked for it."
"Don't get me started on that last one."
"Not if I stop him."
"Nobody can do anything for me."
"I know you have some."
"It seems like he knows everything."
"Do you really want to investigate him?"
"What business brings you to Bree?"
"What is he up to?"
"And who is the lucky one?"
"Let me tell you about him."
"It is a model of elegance."
"They didn't do anything to you?"
"Is your mom home?"
"And you are my best friend."
"What happened to the boys?"
"A juicy investment for these guys."
"This is a free subtitle."
"There must be some logic."
"Did he come out without your knowledge?"
"This is the service entrance."
"It will be used for the fence."
"Let me explain the situation to you."
"It's a guesthouse."
"Okay, do as you wish."
"You must be proud of her."
"Yes, I completely understand."
"I understand his point of view."
"Someone did this to me."
"I know who the father is."
"What did I look like?"
"No, no, I don't think so."
"It's written on the box."
"You have to crawl at his feet."
"A woman like I like them."
"I spent the day here."
"I can't think about it."
"Yes, I'll be right back."
"I want you to be beautiful."
"No, we're going home."
"We removed this bullet."
"I just had a baby."
"Tonight is a big night."
"Do you really think you know your wife?"
"Do you have what I want?"
"Hey, you can't come in."
"They argued all the time."
"Do you think I want it?"
"There always have been."
"I could use a drink."
"I can read lips."
"I'm taking you to the doctor."
"It was about you."
"But I have to earn a living."
"That's what he was."
"Samuel, what time could it be?"
"Do you know what we are?"
"Nobody knows where I am."
"I would love for you to come."
"Not since we were kids."
"No, don't touch that."
"By this ring, I marry you."
"The school is closed due to flooding."
"I've never seen you before."
"I know what I like."
"I'll do you a favor."
"You are taken to the border."
"Can you do something about it?"
"Of course you want to."
"I think she knows that."
"You are good with numbers."
"There is traffic."
"There will be plenty of singles."
"He'll have to find me first."
"They cut up the whole country."
"That's not mine."
"They took my grandson."
"That's it, see you next time."
"Everything will be fixed in a moment."
"My love, what should I do?"
"Thank you, Mr. Owl."
"I love you too, sweetie."
"Is your father at home?"
"That's the dog's name."
"There are other survivors."
"Did you mention our outing?"
"Can I talk to him in private?"
"I want something special."
"Anyone else want to try?"
"You were perfect tonight."
"It's Chinese to me."
"Dad, what happened?"
"Okay, I'll see you later."
"Twice the size of Texas."
"I have some catching up to do."
"I waited all morning."
"These are just numbers."
"Is someone taking care of you?"
"You don't have a job?"
"I don't dare say it."
"I knew you'd like her."
"What should I do with him?"
"I'd better leave you."
"I'll come back and see you later."
"Could you take me home?"
"You're smarter than that."
"No, it's not for me."
"I have a stitch in my side."
"Where is the justice in that?"
"I didn't push her."
"You know what's amazing?"
"Do you want us to work together?"
"Exactly what I was going to say."
"This is for you, my love."
"Nobody knows it exists."
"Where are you going to find the wheat?"
"I wanted him to be happy."
"You're going to suffer later."
"I went out to get some fresh air."
"You remember my name."
"There is a pregnant woman."
"Nobody knows where you are."
"Take these documents to accounting."
"You got it everywhere."
"It's like school."
"Give me the money, so I can go home."
"We are no longer in theory."
"Thank you for staying with me."
"A trigger-happy ex."
"Are you not comfortable here?"
"I brought him a sandwich."
"I studied all night."
"The path through the marshes."
"I'll take that as a compliment."
"This is what you chose."
"Something happened to them."
"It's my job to know."
"It's wonderful to see you again."
"It was time to leave."
"I'll make an exception for you."
"She's at the end of the corridor."
"You never had it."
"So you don't see it?"
"He could be anyone."
"You want them to love you."
"Keep your eyes fixed on me."
"Maybe I would be happier."
"We all need love."
"I know what you have."
"I'm going, it's late."
"There are some in there."
"When did you arrive on Earth?"
"He's just an old friend."
"I would like to talk to someone."
"He sleeps in the cauliflowers."
"I knew I would make it."
"The master is watching over us now."
"Who does this kind of thing?"
"I left them a note."
"She did a good job."
"Hello, what can I do for you?"
"Call us if you need anything."
"For the rest of your life."
"Almost a month ago."
"Energy level close to maximum."
"Tell everyone."
"She gets that from her father."
"I have to give him something."
"What are all these people doing here?"
"No, we won't."
"There's going to be a storm."
"I wish I had done more."
"This guy didn't pay."
"What kind of man was he?"
"Do you have a permit for this?"
"I use it all the time."
"I've been in compliance since I got out."
"I want him arrested."
"I'll keep an eye on you."
"This is Doug's cell phone."
"We should have suspected it."
"What do you mean, you don't know anything?"
"My father was in finance."
"For the theft of the car."
"It's absolutely incredible."
"What if I were one?"
"Can you ask for a large bag?"
"Nothing more to press."
"They are not friends."
"I think this belongs to you."
"And you weren't there."
"I like the view from here."
"Did you see him last night?"
"You're a tough cookie."
"It's a very good school."
"I'm a simple guy."
"I want you to see me."
"What is the agenda?"
"She doesn't have a bra."
"By the way, how is he?"
"I had the same idea."
"Who do you think this is?"
"The Master did not ask."
"I enjoy watching you work, Howard."
"She did it all by herself."
"I'll wait until you're finished."
"You are free as a bird."
"I have to go myself."
"Despite the events in Monaco."
"You had nothing to do with it."
"It will cover my son's."
"I'll send you some money."
"I was a good mother."
"I know what I would do."
"We came as soon as possible."
"It's worth a look."
"You would have been proud of me."
"I met her last night."
"How many bullets did you take?"
"Please give me a sign."
"I built this for you."
"We're in this together."
"I think we understand each other."
"What did she do to me?"
"Do you mean what you say?"
"I can do a presentation, not a demonstration."
"I think it belongs to you."
"He's trying to say something."
"She's not your mother anymore."
"Go down to the access ramp."
"How long do you plan to go?"
"She was seeing someone else."
"How do you think I'm doing?"
"Everyone has to go."
"Do we have time for that?"
"Don't play his game."
"She has some information inside her."
"Are you in love with a girl?"
"On my way to prom."
"Do I understand correctly?"
"Do you really want to talk about this?"
"He's a bounty hunter."
"I have this thing to do."
"You will earn your living with pride."
"How did they finance the pyramids?"
"I dedicated my life to him."
"A good excuse to go back."
"What's in your mouth?"
"They might have the phone."
"Everyone here knows him."
"That's the real reason."
"You shouldn't be here."
"Is there a doctor here?"
"One hour there, one hour back."
"I like to start with dessert."
"She wanted to find her little girl."
"They are not vampires."
"I think I can handle it."
"I know exactly where she is."
"It's a very pretty dress."
"I want to know everything about her."
"I won the lottery."
"Who are you to say that?"
"From front to back."
"She can't do it."
"But that's out of the question."
"We need to clear this up."
"But please read."
"Better luck next time."
"Have you nothing to say?"
"You have no faith."
"I have a suggestion to make."
"But there is a solution."
"You can go home now."
"I got a good deal."
"Just a little bit of your time."
"There's a reason for everything."
"He came back up to the surface."
"Did you want to ask me something?"
"I can't accept them."
"These Jews stick together."
"She cut both arteries."
"I didn't find them."
"You're in it up to your neck."
"I hope we can make it."
"Well, good for you."
"You always take care of everything."
"I know I would."
"I know, it's going to be hard."
"What did I force you to do?"
"It took me years."
"There will be people there."
"His place is among his people."
"She has something special."
"I'm going to get to work."
"And he has other relatives."
"Do you remember the time?"
"She gets on my nerves."
"What do they make you think of?"
"My grandparents raised me."
"It's a countdown."
"She has a brain tumor."
"Can you just make them say hello?"
"What's amazing?"
"And his father, before me."
"She wanted to tell you something."
"Do you see what she's doing?"
"More than a delivery box."
"It's love at first sight."
"Show him who's boss."
"I have to talk about it."
"Where is the control room?"
"I will be there all the time."
"She asks you to call her back."
"Got you good, huh?"
"Put them back when you're done."
"Next time start with this."
"Whatever their dad did."
"You will have what is due to you."
"Looks like I won."
"No one has to know."
"I like a job well done."
"Are there any witnesses?"
"See you at the meeting."
"You would have done it for me."
"I hid something from you."
"The little witch will catch you."
"No point in thinking about it."
"What do you guys think?"
"You know I love him."
"Do you see this gorgeous supermodel?"
"Is this a game for you?"
"They must not find it."
"How many other Jedi survived?"
"I'll sort this out myself."
"You can never plan for everything."
"You don't need me anymore?"
"Can you go all the way?"
"His daughter must have taken after him."
"She's a little late."
"His son was dating the victim."
"But we will never know."
"Did he add anything?"
"Have you spoken to my father?"
"He has a cast-iron alibi."
"I see you all the time."
"I'm talking about you and me."
"Go home, have a drink."
"Where did you go Spider-Man?"
"I was out all night."
"The entire spectrum of human emotions."
"Where have I seen you before?"
"Look at what you have accomplished."
"Do you still think about girls a lot?"
"It was Joshua who called."
"Not that, please."
"I take what I can."
"You will be a great Jedi Knight."
"I'll see you at the hospital."
"I don't take it personally."
"But do you remember my costume?"
"This is the appropriate term."
"I try to make myself useful."
"This is a non-smoking area."
"You have to keep a cool head."
"You slept with my mother."
"Stay a minute if you can."
"I thought you wanted to talk."
"Take care of the Jedi first."
"What did she believe?"
"That's good, that's great."
"I've been waiting for you for an hour."
"In case something happens."
"She takes care of the other two."
"I just want you to leave."
"I'm on the right track."
"She is very proud of you."
"You make a very beautiful couple."
"There's only her."
"It can be any."
"I don't need them."
"Like you always have."
"What's the good news?"
"God has answered your prayers."
"It is the hand of God."
"Do what needs to be done."
"It's supposed to be like this."
"I brought some food."
"I'm going to walk a little longer."
"They are taller than me."
"The Creator did not respond."
"I asked him to pay."
"Do you see the tree over there?"
"He made fun of you."
"We have our driving license."
"She's going to marry another one."
"I had to take care of it."
"There are surely others."
"I had a good idea."
"I want you to get better."
"How much will it cost for the work?"
"Put my decorations on my chest."
"Do you think you're a hero?"
"It's Mrs. Chan's."
"Let them taste Roman steel."
"She will want to go to him."
"Here we go, let's go."
"It is a sign from Apollo."
"A single flow, from the girl."
"It looks like that's it."
"Neighbors reported the smell."
"She didn't answer me."
"We have a gift for you."
"Everyone has someone."
"I've been here for an hour."
"She had hotel numbers."
"No, it's not sure."
"Neither the photos nor the cops."
"She's not mine anymore."
"Of course you're here."
"Yes, this is the right address."
"What have you gotten me into?"
"The key is under the doormat."
"We have a train to catch."
"Yeah, I saw the body."
"Is that the good news?"
"Panama is a friendly country."
"See you this weekend?"
"It's not just anything."
"You didn't sleep with her?"
"What kind of business is this?"
"I'll take a look around."
"I think everything has changed."
"It all started with gangs."
"The further away the better."
"Whatever you want, darling."
"Would you mind repeating that for me?"
"Maybe it was a cat."
"That's what you like."
"You never go home?"
"Don't you want to come with me?"
"Guys, what is this?"
"That's what he would like."
"That's a good dog."
"Don't tell anyone about this."
"Tell me, please."
"Everyone is on edge."
"That leaves us little time."
"I've always loved this photo."
"Thanks to him, you are here."
"I would have come back before he woke up."
"Your Honor, please."
"And it is truly a pleasure."
"I can't swallow this."
"He is taller than you."
"Call Mrs. Chan for me."
"I told you the rest."
"You hid things from me."
"He was in the back seat."
"I'll see you when you get back."
"I'm going to say goodbye to him."
"Because you're a girl."
"I am given a symbolic burial."
"He can take care of himself."
"Are you coming to my party tomorrow?"
"Except your uncle and aunt."
"If I can, I will."
"That's okay, that's okay."
"No, that's not his style."
"This bar has always been my thing."
"I'll give you five dollars for it."
"Do whatever it takes."
"I'll save some for dinner."
"You don't read the press?"
"It's for underwear."
"You were only six years old."
"Maybe we should talk about this."
"I feel so much better now."
"Your son needs you."
"Could you teach him a lesson?"
"Would you do something for me?"
"No, because no one will know."
"Other things come into play."
"You've already done a lot."
"Everyday wine."
"He comes from time to time."
"From a legal point of view."
"I wondered who it was."
"I can't hear that."
"Did she do well?"
"But one thing at a time."
"You mustn't say that."
"It's part of the experience."
"It's like I said."
"He is the key to everything."
"He came to my cell."
"Your neighbor is Al Capone."
"A great battle in the old days."
"It's a little bit better."
"Does it make a difference to her?"
"Something extraordinary has happened."
"It must happen all the time."
"No, we've already talked about it."
"Did you look under the bed?"
"I play it all the time."
"Can we get back to work?"
"It's about your life."
"I need your impression."
"I knew you loved me."
"Do you have jumper cables?"
"She stays because she still hopes."
"I can't ask him."
"Come with me, please."
"They took my son from me."
"You see this cigar box."
"He did this for me."
"Yet I intend to."
"Do you think I would do that?"
"She didn't want to come."
"I release you from this spell."
"What was the agreed price?"
"Do you think she'll come back?"
"Are you doing it right now?"
"Ready to make history?"
"No, it won't."
"I don't have an accent."
"But God had other plans."
"You shouldn't say it."
"I'll make you one."
"I'm proud of you, Vincent."
"She's worth her weight in gold."
"I know guys like you."
"I slept in."
"What do you know about the subject?"
"I tried to warn him."
"That I was a good guy."
"This is the last time, understand?"
"You never said that."
"How did he get into the scene?"
"Can I confess something to you?"
"You forgot how we work."
"I went looking for him."
"No, you've come to the right place."
"Maybe it's a code."
"Open your eyes and close your eyes."
"Like all exceptional men."
"What kind of car was it?"
"You have done so much for me."
"I'm here because of you."
"I'm looking for his schedule."
"That's kind of him."
"Do you want me to read it?"
"About the time of your return."
"All the white people are leaving."
"It's a lifestyle choice."
"Give him a call."
"I left the window open."
"I'll get something later."
"It's a power game."
"She gave me her card."
"I don't want to hide."
"Have you ever been shot?"
"Oh yes, oh yes yes yes."
"Maybe in another color?"
"Everyone in the car."
"I know how it happened."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated."
"I need a nap."
"I know how to take care of you."
"Who just moved in next door?"
"This is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes."
"Is this what awaits us?"
"It's full of thieves here."
"Do you remember this movie?"
"You could have come to see me."
"I had no one else."
"I was told to come."
"But the answer might be."
"She is already in her future."
"She must be inside."
"I asked you something."
"She did it for me."
"I think he believes it."
"What are you asking me to do?"
"From Fox leader to Fox group."
"My God, what have we done?"
"Do I have one, at least?"
"What's your nickname?"
"I think it was him."
"For the same reason as me."
"You are the one who is."
"I swear it's true."
"Come see me before you leave."
"No, thank you, my dear."
"Do what you know how to do."
"Tell me where my son is."
"Some are stronger than me."
"I'll put someone on it."
"Every time it's the same."
"They're everywhere here."
"I have to make money."
"How long has it been, seven, eight years?"
"We still need him."
"And my successor is you."
"Son, let Mom and Dad talk."
"One more day in paradise."
"It's the job that comes in."
"I'll be there in two hours."
"The city that never sleeps."
"Look, this is the new model."
"He is a very good friend."
"Are you back in town?"
"Alexander the Great, as you say."
"You will truly be able to work in peace."
"Can I send him a message?"
"A man like I like them."
"What do you think about this idea?"
"I still like you."
"She's a porn star."
"I knew you would be interested."
"I have a call for you."
"I needed a drink."
"I want what I want."
"She's there, behind my elbow."
"You've never met her."
"Don't try to find me."
"You're on the right track."
"There must be witnesses."
"No, I really have to go."
"They put on a show."
"Could you make less noise?"
"She wanted me to do it."
"At the cost of so many lives."
"Should I take them in different colors?"
"What if it wasn't him?"
"Is your dad home?"
"He has a kind of mask."
"Well, how are you feeling?"
"Everything she needs."
"I'll introduce you to my friends."
"I knew her when she was a kid."
"What if she was telling the truth?"
"It's just a toy."
"You can join her at the restaurant."
"I'm just a soldier."
"Shall we postpone this?"
"How many fingers do I show you?"
"How many men do you need?"
"I just had a vision."
"I'm not anymore."
"Let this be the last time."
"I made you dinner."
"Because it's my job."
"This is what I want to know."
"What kind of friend are you?"
"Let me have a good nap."
"She asks you to hurry up."
"We'll give you something to eat."
"Maybe it's final."
"I made you an offer."
"The solution had always been there."
"What are you doing out so late?"
"I wonder the same thing."
"You're putting me on the street."
"She gave me three."
"We had a great day."
"Tire tracks on a burst belly."
"We need the space."
"I will refund you as soon as possible."
"You have to find the right balance."
"Where did you learn to cook?"
"When did you tell me that?"
"It was with good intentions."
"She will never be beautiful again."
"I sent you a text."
"There are other men."
"Isn't that the point?"
"We just look at each other."
"With the person of my choice."
"We never see his face."
"What does this mean for us?"
"They only see the future."
"I paint, I do things."
"I'll show you a picture."
"I'm going to stay home."
"People have short memories."
"I can be whoever I want."
"Who loves you more than me?"
"I hope you are feeling better."
"Give me some money."
"Who should I trust?"
"She couldn't disappear."
"I went to the clinic."
"He was a very good man."
"I've never read them."
"After you, please."
"How did school go?"
"I just know him."
"I'm playing."
"I bought him some clothes."
"I'm going to have to call the police."
"It's kind of my specialty."
"Don't you want anything else?"
"Was it a farewell dinner?"
"As much as you can give me."
"Sir, what's going on?"
"Give me a minute or two."
"I'll meet you at the hotel."
"I would never have done it."
"This is tomorrow's newspaper."
"You're holding it upside down."
"Lord, what happened to you?"
"I thought she was gone."
"Do we really need this?"
"I know where to find one."
"His private life belonged to the public."
"I should go see that."
"I have to be ready for anything."
"Do you see that woman over there?"
"How did you get through security?"
"I have a son, too."
"All right, keep me posted."
"We need to explain ourselves."
"I want to talk to him first."
"Serves me right."
"What do you say, Jedi Master?"
"It's better than the subway."
"It's all over the air."
"I could cut my hair."
"Don't ask me for more."
"They told me to wait."
"Tell me I'm right."
"But I have to do something."
"We are part of the tribe."
"But there are so many."
"Have fun at the party."
"I hear people's thoughts."
"The country needs you."
"I'm taking care of her now."
"Did it fix itself?"
"Are you tired of me?"
"There is a man outside."
"That's a whole other story."
"You are someone important."
"She is not one of them."
"I know you are innocent."
"No, that's not done."
"Frankie, you're a good boy."
"His sister is making her first communion."
"No, I won't make it."
"She stayed in her room."
"Will we see each other again?"
"I need your enlightenment."
"It's a family heirloom."
"Come forward, and I will explain everything to you."
"That's when I was a kid."
"We see this all the time."
"Do you think he's involved?"
"Let's talk to Brendan about it tomorrow."
"I came to pick up my father."
"Glad to have worked with you."
"I barely saw her."
"Yes, three years ago."
"It might be the same."
"Many years ago."
"They are using our satellites against us."
"And I am grateful to you for that."
"You look older."
"I knew it had to happen."
"You can open your eyes now."
"I should do it myself."
"I have a very good idea."
"I was the master of Zen."
"I must answer this call."
"But Elaine is taking care of you."
"You've never been here?"
"I already asked you."
"I'm going to go through this window."
"Tell me what he's talking about."
"I'll only stay a few minutes."
"It was a good experience."
"You have to look on the bright side."
"There is a lot of noise."
"He is an arms dealer."
"Did you at least talk to him?"
"When did he leave you?"
"What did he do for a living?"
"I want to go to the hospital."
"Stay here, please."
"Are you so sure about everything?"
"He deceived everyone."
"Everyone will laugh with you."
"I hope to impress him anyway."
"I need a witness."
"Nice to chat with you."
"My feelings for you are real."
"Maybe that's a clue."
"I have had a long journey."
"I heard it the first time."
"Don't I seem calm to you?"
"Who should I contact?"
"We'll find you a place."
"When you find yourself a girl?"
"My husband is a good man."
"Let me give you an example."
"I should have been with her."
"Did he tell you something?"
"I guess we'll see each other again."
"I guess it is."
"They look like an old married couple."
"She unrolls it backwards."
"I am younger than you."
"It's quite charming."
"If you want to leave, go ahead."
"Yes, I remember that well."
"There is glass everywhere."
"Do you see that man over there?"
"Have you ever talked to him about it?"
"You are outside your jurisdiction."
"Do you have to do this?"
"He'll do just fine."
"Where are they right now?"
"And the most important article."
"What happened to Omar?"
"It's been closed for years."
"Everyone has friends."
"You are not a person."
"We're going to have to do a lot."
"You know what surprises me?"
"I got a good point."
"I would like to speak to my husband."
"You know I would."
"We understand each other, you and I."
"I found a small apartment."
"It's for national security."
"This is our way of doing things."
"I am in a delicate position."
"Yes, I will do my best."
"What was in there?"
"How did this happen, you say?"
"We have to start from scratch."
"I was only doing my duty."
"I'll try to call him."
"Looks like I was right."
"It's quite clear."
"It's better for your health."
"You can't hide anymore."
"The shooter is outside."
"You don't want to keep it?"
"Do you have something for us?"
"We have a delivery to make."
"No need, I have my own."
"And you let him go?"
"I think we've arrived."
"You'll understand when you grow up."
"You never helped me."
"Are you that good?"
"They will be here in a few minutes."
"You're a celebrity in class."
"Was it because of me?"
"He must have had enough."
"She must not see me."
"I'll make a few calls."
"So what did the doctor say?"
"Are you a good man, Inspector?"
"How long did it take?"
"This is what he did."
"Tyler's door was closed."
"Is he waiting for you?"
"Thank you for stopping the killers."
"Do whatever you want."
"I worked at a country club."
"You look good in this photo."
"You weren't followed?"
"I have to get to work."
"Where do you want me to start?"
"Don't try to follow us."
"I have to go, guys."
"I'm here, that's all."
"We're here for a while."
"How did you know about the widow?"
"Do you still have a toothache?"
"Oh yes, please."
"Front center on the altar."
"Tell them what you want."
"How could I say that?"
"I brought you a sandwich."
"Did they come back safe and sound?"
"I could take you at your word."
"We've known each other since high school."
"It looks like he's gone."
"News travels fast around here."
"What were you doing in his room?"
"Say goodbye to your friend."
"What do you want to do with him?"
"Yes, it's the first time."
"I was up all night."
"I cut my wrist."
"Do you need more time?"
"She should have told me."
"I have just one question left."
"I can give you names."
"You only talk about that."
"I like what you do."
"You haven't changed at all."
"I'll stay around."
"What do they look like?"
"They don't say that."
"And you may be right."
"No, we're not together."
"Nobody has anything to say?"
"There are about a hundred of them."
"So, did you have fun?"
"But it has to stay between us."
"V as in Victor, do you receive me?"
"You will end up in history books."
"Or you can come with me."
"The air will do me good."
"It's bigger than that."
"It's only for a few days."
"Thank you for sharing this with me."
"I have an appointment with her."
"You dropped something."
"I believe they are."
"It's one of my dreams."
"You keep saying that."
"You think I want that?"
"Don't you find that curious?"
"If you'll have me."
"Was it because of the dream?"
"He showed us the way."
"Everyone heard it."
"I'd rather it was you."
"How do you know if it's him?"
"Where did you find this dress?"
"It was like a movie."
"I was doing very well."
"I've never done anything to you."
"I did all the work."
"You took my life."
"It might be very easy."
"I'm here for work."
"I almost got caught."
"I'll come with you, if you want."
"Finally some Donald-esque ideas."
"Everything's fine, officer."
"You said I could."
"Where could he possibly come from?"
"Is he that good?"
"It could have ended there."
"Try not to think about it anymore."
"We need his men."
"It is a security system."
"I've seen this face before."
"You know what would be great?"
"Of course he's right."
"I have a business lunch."
"No, that's not going to be possible."
"The whole house was searched."
"I have one of those migraines."
"Morale is at its lowest."
"I wonder where she's going."
"It's a very small town."
"So why did you do that?"
"I was just having fun."
"I have been doing this job for a long time."
"But she didn't come."
"Did you take aspirin?"
"Don't tell the Elf anything."
"I should be by his side."
"What time is it there?"
"If it exists, I will find it."
"That sounds reasonable to me."
"What's all this screaming about?"
"We see what they see."
"She didn't go."
"Now is the time to act."
"We are a nation of laws."
"We need to do better than that."
"You are very good like that."
"It's written in your file."
"I know how they feel."
"Because it has already started."
"I was sure I would convince you."
"I think I'm done."
"Do you really want me to leave?"
"He went to the bank."
"We are proud of our reputation."
"That's generous of him."
"I had never thought of it."
"It's part of my plan."
"She will speak when she is ready."
"I want to know how you are."
"For what I said."
"I learned that from you."
"Did they give you any records?"
"Have you ever been in combat?"
"Next time will be the right one."
"I have it in front of my eyes."
"I have to call the cops."
"Haven't you read the newspaper?"
"I learned a lot of things."
"Yes, but it's mine."
"I'll see you in an hour."
"What kind of cop are you?"
"I vouch for him."
"He needs you now."
"I'll talk to you while I eat."
"But there are rules."
"This is why we are selling the company."
"I need you to leave."
"The number is on the fridge."
"And I trust you."
"Everyone here knows that."
"Did you know he was married?"
"I have never loved anyone."
"You must have a name."
"Your sister is having her communion tomorrow."
"I need the truth."
"They disappeared from circulation."
"You leave in one hour and ten minutes."
"Let's go get something to eat."
"Is this the king approaching?"
"She's been there from the beginning."
"I need an advance."
"The least I can do."
"It's your day off."
"Tell him what's going on."
"The victim's parents arrive."
"Team surveillance, phone tapping."
"Did your dad buy you this?"
"No, I'll do it later."
"He appears to be a professional player."
"You don't know anything about us."
"Where have you two been?"
"I need to talk to him first."
"Well, what's going on?"
"You did a good deed."
"You will be blacklisted."
"Listen, drive, I'll pay, and that's it."
"Do you think you're a Jedi?"
"It's cake time."
"Are you sure about the address?"
"Tell him I came by."
"We'll do it next month."
"There is a power plant."
"I can give you my number."
"It's a very long journey."
"My train leaves in an hour."
"I remember every detail."
"When did she say that?"
"I'm from the prosecutor's office."
"I'm doing a little cleaning."
"He is being well taken care of."
"I brought you a book."
"I want to keep this document."
"I'll meet you at your place then."
"I think she is."
"Is Security looking for me?"
"How's it going, guys?"
"And she, does she have someone?"
"I order you to disperse."
"And which side are you on?"
"Maybe he's our man."
"It was a stroke of luck."
"We need to settle down."
"She had no right."
"Tell him when he arrives."
"A super strong fishing line?"
"You wouldn't have any change?"
"What happened, darling?"
"No, she doesn't."
"Do you have any news for me?"
"I am running for city council."
"This is the last straw."
"I'm coming to see how you're doing."
"I want to be with my family."
"Will you be there for dinner?"
"Thank you for this vote of confidence."
"But we don't have any."
"There is paperwork."
"I'm worth a million dollars."
"Is everyone having a good time?"
"He is a very handsome man."
"Okay, I'll leave you."
"I'm going to give you a massage."
"Is he cute?"
"Mac, what's going on?"
"You have this power, too."
"I take what I want."
"I promised to do it."
"You will put the same number."
"You didn't follow her?"
"He's almost family."
"We got you out of there."
"What do you have left?"
"Did this happen, please?"
"I remember his face."
"I looked it up in the dictionary."
"Because I'll tell him."
"You don't have to ask."
"You don't know the law?"
"Mom, have you seen my sweater?"
"What is the check number?"
"What would I gain from it?"
"You are safe here with me."
"I feel safe with you."
"You know you want to."
"I know you want to."
"I don't feel like playing."
"That was five years ago."
"I just thought of something."
"You didn't say a word."
"There's something in there."
"I'm glad you're here."
"I'm so happy to see you."
"Is that what you wanted to hear?"
"It's a pleasure to see you."
"Do you think that makes me happy?"
"This is how it begins."
"I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
"That's what she would have wanted."
"It's a little early for me."
"I knew you could do it."
"You love me, don't you?"
"Come on, I'll show you something."
"That's exactly what they want."
"I knew you were going to say that."
"Sorry it didn't work out."
"Why are you so nice to me?"
"There might be a way."
"I'm going to be late for work."
"Did you write this?"
"What if he doesn't?"
"Tell us what happened."
"I'll see if he's there."
"Same thing, please."
"It was a year ago."
"There is a call for you."
"This is the beginning of the end."
"What did you do to your hair?"
"Please let me go."
"That was ten years ago."
"You should see what I see."
"You know what that reminds me of?"
"I just want you to be happy."
"It's a gift from my father."
"That's what I was telling you."
"You won't have to."
"This is what I needed."
"It's the same for everyone."
"You love him, don't you?"
"I found it myself."
"You don't have to be."
"It's in the order of things."
"Nothing comes to mind."
"I'll put them in water."
"Of course I did."
"I've seen it somewhere before."
"No, I've never seen it."
"Because he told me so."
"Of course he did."
"I know you did it."
"He's the love of my life."
"It's my daughter's birthday."
"But she didn't."
"I read it in a book."
"I'm just following orders."
"But what's happening to you?"
"I love you with all my heart."
"I never asked you for anything."
"Are you sure it's there?"
"What's between you?"
"I'll call you as soon as I can."
"We'll take you to the hospital."
"I'll take you to the hospital."
"I'll only say it once."
"What's he doing here?"
"I read it in the newspaper."
"What do they know about it?"
"I can't answer that."
"This is where it gets interesting."
"I heard it on the radio."
"I thought we agreed."
"Was there anyone else?"
"I have to become something else."
"It's good to hear your voice."
"It's my turn to go."
"There is a draft."
"Now, if you'll excuse me."
"I'm the one who should be apologizing."
"There is always hope."
"He asked me to marry him."
"That's what we're going to find out."
"This is what we have to find out."
"There may be a solution."
"It's the world upside down."
"What do you see in him?"
"This conversation never took place."
"Look what I brought you."
"Can I make a call?"
"I'm going to make some phone calls."
"What do you want me to tell him?"
"What makes you smile?"
"You know what I did?"
"That's what I would have done."
"I have a lot of things to do."
"I have someone to introduce to you."
"Do I look okay?"
"I've heard so much about you."
"I heard a gunshot."
"Look what I have for you."
"I saw this on TV."
"I had a car accident."
"I promised not to say anything."
"I've been thinking about it all day."
"I know what I heard."
"What do you want me to do with it?"
"I'm tired of all this."
"I've heard that somewhere before."
"I was about to leave."
"I have good news for you."
"I had a very good evening."
"I have things to tell you."
"I was going to ask you the same thing."
"I did what I had to."
"I do what I want with it."
"I've been doing this all my life."
"I have a word to say to you."
"She's all I have."
"I made a few phone calls."
"I meant what I said."
"I have something to give you."
"I have an offer to make you."
"That's what I was going to do."
"I saw this in a movie."
"I've seen this somewhere before."
"I don't have the head for that."
"Because I need you."
"Do you think I had a choice?"
"I have two words to say to you."
"I'll see what I have."
"I've lived here all my life."
"I should have thought of that sooner."
"I wasn't born yesterday."
"It's time to turn the page."
"I know exactly how you feel."
"He's an old friend of mine."
"I look forward to working with you."
"Did you find what you were looking for?"
"I found what I was looking for."
"That's how you learn."
"How many times do I have to repeat it?"
"I've always dreamed of doing this."
"It's the calm before the storm."
"There must be another explanation."
"Do you want me to prove it to you?"
"It gives me goosebumps."
"It's up to me to judge."
"Can I ask you a personal question?"
"What betrayed me?"
"I hope it was worth it."
"I've never felt like this before."
"It's the law of the jungle."
"There are more important things."
"What held you back?"
"It's nap time."
"I now pronounce you husband and wife."
"I have my work cut out for me."
"Do you realize what you've done?"
"I knew I would find you here."
"A needle in a haystack."
"I told you it would work."
"I was hoping you would tell me."
"Looking for me while hiding me."
"I'll believe it when I see it."
"I want everything to go back to the way it was."
"That's what I remember."
"It's just the two of us."
"No, it is not a question."
"I know what he said."
"Don't you have anything else to do?"
"What is he doing to her?"
"It's time for school."
"You know what I would like to do?"
"Can you do something for me?"
"Do you know where we can find it?"
"Women and children first."
"I never really thought about it."
"I never told you."
"I want you to be safe."
"That's all we ask."
"What if we don't succeed?"
"Aren't you inviting me in?"
"That's what he would have wanted."
"I have the right to be here."
"Is that what you were going to say?"
"Okay, we can go."
"Are you telling me that?"
"There must be a better way."
"I have an appointment with someone."
"Do you really think this will work?"
"You know it and I know it."
"Is that what you're going to do?"
"We have a few questions for you."
"I wish that were the case."
"When it's over, it's over."
"I have fulfilled my part of the contract."
"Open the door, please."
"She never told me."
"There is something between us."
"I have a deal for you."
"So what will it be?"
"Did you make it?"
"What was I going to say?"
"That was four years ago."
"I saw it in your eyes."
"Do you know what we need?"
"Do you want me to call someone?"
"Do you want to know what it is?"
"How did your date go?"
"It was a week ago."
"There must be others."
"I told you I'd be back."
"From what I've been told."
"She is a force of nature."
"I didn't think about that."
"Is there something between you?"
"What do you intend to do?"
"Come on, I want to show you something."
"It's the end of an era."
"It's for the good of all."
"It was him, wasn't it?"
"Do you have anything else to tell me?"
"It is the law of nature."
"She doesn't have long left."
"I didn't really think about it."
"I haven't really thought about it."
"I have everything I want."
"That was months ago."
"Things are what they are."
"I'll be with you in a second."
"But what's done is done."
"There is a reason for that."
"Do you know what that is?"
"It's me who should thank you."
"What happened to your arm?"
"I'll tell you a little secret."
"Please don't say anything."
"That's all we want."
"Can I see it?"
"I asked myself the same question."
"We will take good care of you."
"I know this is a lot to ask."
"Do what you want with me."
"He was the love of my life."
"Can I use the bathroom?"
"I was going to tell you the same thing."
"Is it a man or a woman?"
"What are you doing, Dad?"
"That's what I want to find out."
"Well, what is it?"
"He doesn't know who he is anymore."
"This is my father's car."
"I know what he did."
"I have another surprise for you."
"It was a lifetime ago."
"It's like this every day."
"Do you want me to go talk to him?"
"It made me think of you."
"I know he did."
"I'm sure she's fine."
"I'll do anything for you."
"I can only agree."
"She didn't say a word."
"Is that what you're telling me?"
"You don't answer my calls."
"It's up to me to apologize."
"I'm sure everything will be fine."
"Were there others?"
"It's just goodbye."
"There must be a logical explanation."
"I said it was good."
"What did she get?"
"I don't trust you anymore."
"I found him on the street."
"That's exactly what I was saying."
"I have never seen this man."
"Let me through, please."
"I have a secret to tell you."
"She never told me about it."
"That's my father's name."
"What is it, my daughter?"
"I have a very important appointment."
"I'm surprised to see you here."
"What's stopping us?"
"Is that all you know?"
"That's what I plan to do."
"Do you know what you're asking me?"
"I have something that belongs to you."
"Got what you need?"
"What is the point of all this?"
"I've always been there for you."
"Did you tell the police?"
"That's all I see."
"This is where I want to be."
"This is the last thing to do."
"May God's will be done."
"No, she didn't."
"What do I look like I'm doing?"
"That's what people do."
"Tell me what you need."
"I'm going to tell you about my mother."
"That was six months ago."
"Do you know what you're going to say?"
"Who told you to do that?"
"So what are we waiting for?"
"What happened to my son?"
"And then what happened?"
"Please come with me."
"Someone else did it."
"That's what I believed too."
"He was shot in the back."
"It's the cycle of life."
"All good things must come to an end."
"How can you say such a thing?"
"There is always a first time."
"It was a few years ago."
"What did you drink?"
"What are we going to say?"
"That's what it means."
"I've seen you somewhere before."
"She had a car accident."
"After everything we've been through?"
"Someone must have seen something."
"Yes, that's what they say."
"That's all you'll get."
"Where is your sense of adventure?"
"It's a police matter."
"It's not just them."
"That's how I work."
"This may be our last chance."
"It's you I've come to see."
"Crystal clear."
"I hope you can forgive me."
"That's the word I was looking for."
"I didn't start it."
"It's just a figure of speech."
"I never trusted him."
"That's what they did."
"I've never heard that name."
"That's what we want to know."
"It's a job like any other."
"I need to get out of here."
"This is what we are going to see."
"And what happened next?"
"I left it in the car."
"I've told you a thousand times."
"Do you understand what I am telling you?"
"You brought me here for this?"
"That's what I'm thinking."
"You will have everything you want."
"I have a lot of things on my mind."
"It's getting harder and harder."
"But let me tell you something."
"I wanted it to be a surprise."
"That's the beauty of it."
"I have some questions for him."
"After everything that happened?"
"I made some phone calls."
"She's the one who did that."
"He said he would be there."
"I need you to do it."
"I think I know what it is."
"What's keeping you here?"
"I wonder what he wants."
"Sorry for what I said."
"I'm glad I did it."
"That's when it happened."
"Any idea who it could be?"
"I haven't stopped calling you."
"You could do whatever you want."
"It's not about him."
"I just don't want to."
"I don't think you understand."
"He was always there for me."
"I need everyone."
"It'll take a minute."
"This is what we need to find out."
"Can I have some privacy?"
"Must be my lucky day."
"It brings tears to my eyes."
"You have a sense of humor."
"You don't need this anymore."
"I have something else to tell you."
"How do you think I feel?"
"I just want to ask you a few questions."
"She doesn't answer my calls."
"That's what I learned."
"Who asked you to do this?"
"I think that's the case."
"This is a big day for me."
"How did you know it was me?"
"No, I don't want to go."
"It's good that you came."
"You are nothing to me anymore."
"What the hell are they doing here?"
"Do you know what's going to happen?"
"I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI."
"What would it have changed?"
"How does this affect me?"
"Do you know something I don't?"
"Until I met you."
"I'm glad to be back."
"You do what you want with it."
"That's all I own."
"What stopped you?"
"I have something in my eye."
"What did we learn?"
"What's in it for you?"
"You have something that belongs to me."
"How long have you known this?"
"It's a gift from my mother."
"He is a very good person."
"I hope you slept well."
"Call me back when you get this message."
"That was six years ago."
"What's it going to be?"
"You know what I noticed?"
"I am proud of you, my son."
"I told you to let it go."
"I wanted to tell you in person."
"There are many more."
"Thank you for telling me the truth."
"There must be another exit."
"Why is this so important to you?"
"But I'll tell you something."
"How could you hide this from me?"
"I knew it would end like this."
"Well, what do you want?"
"There is no girl."
"What if he isn't?"
"What if it wasn't?"
"Tell me what I want to know."
"Don't ask me to do that."
"What happened to your head?"
"I think I'll stay here."
"Hey, what the hell are you doing?"
"What are you all looking at?"
"Let's hear what he has to say."
"Where did you learn to do this?"
"Do you want me to do something?"
"Nobody knows we're here."
"That's where it started."
"I believe that is the case."
"You don't need her."
"They said it on the radio."
"That's good, that's very good."
"I know what time it is."
"But what's happening to me?"
"You know what I think about it?"
"No, he didn't tell me anything."
"I'm just telling you."
"I'll tell you something good."
"This might be my last chance."
"But that's what you wanted."
"I should have told you before."
"There is something different."
"I'll send it to you right away."
"What is more important?"
"I know what you want to do."
"I said I would."
"I have the situation well in hand."
"Your secret is safe with me."
"I want you to be my wife."
"You know it's the truth."
"I have a deal to offer you."
"But who isn't there?"
"But what am I talking about?"
"Did he say what he wanted?"
"You have things to say to each other."
"That's very kind of him."
"It's up to me to say."
"I feel safe with him."
"My God, what's going on?"
"I was thinking of someone else."
"It's my son's birthday."
"I can't do anything more for him."
"I don't need her."
"I wonder who it could be."
"Don't say things like that."
"I always get what I want."
"It was two months ago."
"There are all kinds."
"Look what he did to me."
"You know I love you, right?"
"This is where I grew up."
"And you didn't."
"Where's your sense of humor?"
"I called you all night."
"That's what I want to hear."
"I'll see what it is."
"We do the best we can."
"She can do whatever she wants."
"I will remember it all my life."
"I wonder what's going on."
"I have something to tell him."
"I have already spoken to the police."
"He was the one who found me."
"I stand by what I said."
"That was two weeks ago."
"Am I right or am I right?"
"I did it to protect you."
"What's going on down there?"
"Tell him what he wants to know."
"It depends on what you want."
"Is he allowed to do that?"
"Did you tell your mother?"
"There's only one second."
"I wrote that."
"His body was never found."
"I thought you liked me."
"Look what he did to you."
"You think this is a game?"
"I have an announcement to make to you."
"That was the end of the story."
"That's really nice of you."
"Do you want me to call the police?"
"That's what I wanted to do."
"That was seven years ago."
"Maybe it's for the best."
"We will do everything we can."
"How long have you worked here?"
"I'll see if she's there."
"I'm in the middle of something."
"I said I was fine."
"He did the right thing."
"Because you asked me to."
"What are we going to eat?"
"I know what you said."
"What do you want now?"
"This might be the last time."
"It's up to us to do it."
"I needed to get some fresh air."
"Have you ever seen anything like this?"
"A healthy mind resides in a healthy body."
"We know what that means."
"Willingly or unwillingly, you will speak."
"I promise you everything will be okay."
"Is this someone I know?"
"That's the impression I get."
"I haven't asked him yet."
"It has everything you need."
"What does she see in him?"
"No, that doesn't make sense."
"It was the year of rebirth."
"I'm glad you're home."
"That's what we do here."
"What happened to your eye?"
"Is it because of your mother?"
"I want you to meet someone."
"I want you to stay with me."
"I had a shitty day."
"I don't have time now."
"I think she's telling the truth."
"Do you know what we could do?"
"I've been calling you all day."
"Tell him what happened."
"That's what she did."
"I must be able to trust you with my life."
"I wonder what she's doing."
"For all you have done."
"I can't remember."
"She didn't tell me about it."
"We heard gunshots."
"You may have heard of it."
"I was told to come here."
"This is the reason for my coming."
"There is water everywhere."
"You know what it is, right?"
"It's time for breakfast."
"I'm done with all that."
"What can you tell me about him?"
"That's what had to be done."
"She got what she deserved."
"This is what we need to find."
"I've told you a hundred times."
"Is that what you're talking about?"
"There is a reason for this."
"There must be something we can do."
"That's what people say."
"I think about him all the time."
"Call if you need me."
"This is exactly what I'm talking about."
"We heard a gunshot."
"This is the reason for my presence."
"He told me a lot about you."
"We have to face the facts."
"I just want you to know."
"What happened to your leg?"
"We have something to tell you."
"I would like you to come with me."
"It's about your brother."
"I brought you a little gift."
"No, I'm not talking about that."
"And you agree with that?"
"I know you're not sleeping."
"I want to know what you know."
"So what brings you here?"
"You said you would."
"Do you remember our first meeting?"
"Do you see what that means?"
"That's what I should do."
"That's all they had."
"It's not what it used to be."
"What happened to the girl?"
"That's what the job requires."
"Can I talk to you about something?"
"No, it's someone else."
"You know what I mean?"
"I have an important announcement to make."
"This is a big step forward."
"You told me yourself."
"Don't you realize it?"
"It's a pleasure to be here."
"So what are you up to?"
"This is the reason for my visit."
"I want you to know something."
"There must be another reason."
"I just wanted to see how you were doing."
"I think you should go."
"You're going to have to do better than that."
"This is where we part ways."
"Where is the rest of the team?"
"Is there more than one?"
"That's what I believed."
"It's the law of the strongest."
"I woke up in the hospital."
"Don't try to change the subject."
"If so, so much the better."
"No, it's not that simple."
"Did you have a good weekend?"
"What do you want, man?"
"I want you to know one thing."
"I can lend you some money."
"I thought you did it."
"Please don't move."
"This is the safest place."
"I'm all he has."
"If that's what it takes."
"But what do I have?"
"There is a serial number."
"He said he would."
"It's a race against time."
"A magician never reveals his secrets."
"It's my mother's birthday."
"What is the purpose of your visit?"
"That's what I'm going to find out."
"There is a family resemblance."
"Are you seeing anyone right now?"
"Do exactly as I tell you."
"I didn't tell him about it."
"And what do we have?"
"What the hell are we going to do?"
"I have a question for him."
"Our love will last as long as the stars."
"He told me himself."
"You know what I said?"
"That's so kind of you."
"How could you do this to us?"
"Do you know what she did?"
"Look what I bought you."
"I don't have any either."
"I want to spend time with you."
"I do what needs to be done."
"I want you to tell me."
"There's someone up there."
"I only told the truth."
"You tell me what's going on?"
"This is a madhouse."
"It wasn't luck."
"They do everything they can."
"It reminds me of the good old days."
"Tell me what I did."
"You have two million in this safe?"
"Do you swear to tell the whole truth?"
"I'm the one who called you."
"You know what he's capable of."
"There is no more time."
"It will be better for everyone."
"This is the end of the story."
"I'm sure it's him."
"That's what I always do."
"Excuse me, I'll be right back."
"Do you think it's that simple?"
"He was a force of nature."
"I will give you what you want."
"You can call me whenever you want."
"It's a place like any other."
"I'm fine where I am."
"What caused this?"
"Tell them what you saw."
"But what are you wearing?"
"This is what we are going to find out."
"I did all this for you."
"It suits you to say that."
"Yes, I did it myself."
"I read it in the newspapers."
"That was very kind of you."
"That's all they know."
"We have a lot of work to do."
"I think you should see this."
"I've never seen you here."
"That was weeks ago."
"I enjoy spending time with you."
"You are the man for the job."
"I want to know who did this."
"You haven't changed your mind?"
"You've never worked in Berlin."
"You need to get out of here."
"I don't remember her."
"Everyone knows who you are."
"You did well to call me."
"Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
"I heard the gunshot."
"There must be something here."
"It's the circle of life."
"I want to be there when he wakes up."
"I have some news to tell you."
"No, that's not my style."
"I've been doing it all my life."
"She couldn't have gone far."
"I don't know, I swear."
"I have fulfilled my part of the bargain."
"What exactly are we looking for?"
"That's what I want too."
"Everyone deserves a second chance."
"I love you more than my life."
"But what do we do?"
"Do you think the same as me?"
"He's just a little boy."
"It's good to be the king."
"After all I've done?"
"That was three months ago."
"That's about it, yes."
"This is my daughter's car."
"I thought he was with you."
"What about my father?"
"No, I think it's good."
"I go there from time to time."
"I'm sure everything is fine."
"What is it, my child?"
"That's what he needs."
"I know what they are capable of."
"Not after what happened."
"I'll be back for dinner."
"Do what you want with it."
"I saw it in the newspaper."
"Who could have done such a thing?"
"After what he did to you?"
"I never knew his name."
"You don't go to school?"
"Please stay with me."
"What do I do then?"
"She said she loved me."
"You have to come get me."
"He said what it was?"
"I could do this all day."
"I found this in his pocket."
"We'll take good care of you."
"You haven't told him yet?"
"I'm going to put an end to all this."
"That's exactly what I was talking about."
"How did you know where I was?"
"It's just us here."
"That's what I have to find out."
"We need to take you to the hospital."
"Of course you did."
"You're going to be late for work."
"It's time to make a decision."
"What can we say?"
"You have done me a great service."
"Tell me you have something."
"Could you do something for me?"
"It could mean anything."
"I hope it goes well."
"It was a month ago."
"What are you hiding from us?"
"There is a letter for you."
"Less than an hour ago."
"So, what do I look like?"
"And what's going on?"
"You know what I need?"
"He didn't say anything else?"
"She never recovered from it."
"I am the happiest of men."
"Is this what happened to you?"
"It's just between you and me."
"Is that when you say it?"
"There is a change of plan."
"I'm tired of this life."
"I never thought about that."
"I thought it was an accident."
"Do you think I'm going to swallow this?"
"I looked into his eyes."
"Want to take a look?"
"I said what I thought."
"All that remains is to wait."
"I don't want that here."
"Let the Ring-bearer decide."
"I read something about it."
"I want to see what's going on."
"You have your work cut out for you."
"He is like a brother to me."
"Do you know who you're dealing with?"
"You didn't call the police?"
"There are lives at stake."
"What if you can't do it?"
"What is written here?"
"Of course I thought about it."
"Is it just the two of you?"
"All of this is thanks to you."
"I think you don't understand."
"I have so much to say."
"I should have realized that."
"A quarter of an hour ago."
"There will be no war."
"What's underneath?"
"I took care of it myself."
"How long are you here for?"
"He's trying to tell us something."
"But this is only the beginning."
"That's what we always say."
"I need a change of scenery."
"Have you told your parents?"
"I never saw his face."
"So much has happened."
"You have your father's eyes."
"I'm not either."
"It is the law of the majority."
"I ask you again."
"Do you know what I saw?"
"At least, that's what they say."
"What happened to your nose?"
"We'll deal with him later."
"I've been waiting for you all my life."
"There must be more to it than that."
"Is this clear to everyone?"
"I thought we were past that."
"But I know who did it."
"I must say I am impressed."
"I just need a few minutes."
"The best defense is offense."
"What happened to my brother?"
"I am a friend of your mother."
"Can you come, please?"
"Is that really what you think?"
"What did I mean?"
"I told him to do it."
"What if they don't?"
"There is a police car."
"I'll see if I can find it."
"For everything you've done."
"I have a doctor's appointment."
"You told me to do it."
"Remember what I said."
"After everything we've been through."
"You don't have much time left."
"It's photo time."
"And what do you do for a living?"
"I just got off the phone with him."
"If you want it, come and get it."
"Please trust me."
"You have to make do with what you have."
"You have everything you want."
"I am very happy to see you."
"It's not me either."
"No, it's not too late."
"I never had children."
"You say that to please me."
"That's exactly how I feel."
"That's the impression it gives."
"This is where we need to go."
"That's what we're talking about."
"You must not be late."
"Do you want to talk to me about something?"
"Please say something."
"It's an honor to be here."
"Not after what I did."
"This is a good starting point."
"Is that what you're telling yourself?"
"Is there anyone here?"
"I can see it in his eyes."
"That's how it was when I arrived."
"Are you sure it was him?"
"The whole world knows who you are."
"Please say hello to me."
"Where are the car keys?"
"I'm sure that's it."
"I never told you about it."
"What are you doing to us?"
"I had time to think."
"They got what they wanted."
"Do you think it's a coincidence?"
"I need you to listen to me."
"I have something you want."
"What if she isn't?"
"Do you remember the last time?"
"Do I look like a cop?"
"I dreamed about you last night."
"Thank you for agreeing to meet me."
"This is a case of force majeure."
"This is my mother's recipe."
"I have some money saved."
"What should I think?"
"Keep doing what you're doing."
"What exactly is going on?"
"It's about your father."
"He left you Cul-de-Sac."
"I just got lucky."
"Do you want me to stay with you?"
"I never told him that."
"Have you ever shot someone?"
"This is what we all want."
"But what does he want?"
"I think about him every day."
"There is a password."
"We have everything you need."
"I'll see you when I see you."
"I have a wife and a kid."
"Do you know what tomorrow is?"
"That's what you asked for."
"There is something to be proud of."
"I want you to be with me."
"No, I've never met him."
"It's time to get some answers."
"I'm late for school."
"I sent her on an errand."
"And what do we say?"
"Sometimes you don't have a choice."
"I hope you had fun."
"I wanted to have a little fun."
"It's around the corner."
"You know what I learned?"
"What if she doesn't?"
"When will it end?"
"Go ahead and take a look."
"Leave a message and I'll call you back."
"And I know what it is."
"Do you think I want to?"
"Look what they did to you."
"My Lord, O my Lord, my sir."
"It happens to me from time to time."
"That's how I am."
"What do I need to understand?"
"I'll do it if you do it."
"I'd like to talk about the role."
"You didn't tell anyone?"
"It's his word against mine."
"We have something to show you."
"It didn't work either."
"There may be a connection."
"All right, I'll tell you."
"Did you understand me?"
"You know what I want to do?"
"There must be thousands of them."
"I want to hear it from his mouth."
"I have never flown."
"Can you lend me some money?"
"I only have a short time."
"You have an aunt in the Valley."
"Show us what you can do."
"She was the love of my life."
"This is the icing on the cake."
"Do you know what I discovered?"
"That's what I planned."
"You know what needs to be done."
"I will not answer this question."
"I don't remember very well."
"Whatever happens, stay with me."
"That was eight years ago."
"I should have been there for you."
"Did you see who did that?"
"That's what he's going to do."
"I've heard that all my life."
"What proves it to me?"
"I have something for you too."
"What the hell are we doing now?"
"Is this supposed to cheer me up?"
"Don't do that to me."
"No, I'm the one who's sorry."
"This is my mother's house."
"How did it go last night?"
"He seemed fine."
"I have a lot to learn from you."
"I know what you saw."
"I appreciate it more and more."
"I said I was going."
"I see you, brother, and thank you."
"I told my mother."
"I heard his voice in my head."
"I've been looking for you all day."
"I only thought about that."
"I saw her on TV."
"He will remember it before the end."
"I brought him."
"I'm the only one who was right."
"I told you to sit down."
"I think I'll do it."
"You will be my eyes and ears."
"Can't we talk about something else?"
"I'll get you some ice."
"I think I would remember it."
"I am the man for the job."
"I'm going to put them in a vase."
"I did it, that's all."
"You haven't aged a day."
"He was here just now."
"He says it's very important."
"How nice of you to come."
"You better get used to it."
"I want it to be a surprise."
"I hope you have a plan."
"This is where I was born."
"Look what they did to me."
"I called earlier."
"What do I need to know?"
"Is everything okay here?"
"Come this way, please."
"You seem to like it."
"Isn't it the same as here?"
"Go tell him how you feel."
"This is exactly what I was looking for."
"What does that tell you?"
"Is that all you want?"
"There is an ongoing investigation."
"No, I already told you."
"I would do whatever you want."
"But what am I saying?"
"I'll tell you in the car."
"You did a very good job."
"Don't take this lightly."
"Is this what you saw?"
"Two or three days ago."
"What did I do to deserve you?"
"What do I offer you?"
"Please open the door."
"So, here's what we're going to do."
"On the other side of town."
"Are you sure it's her?"
"If you say so, I believe you."
"Will this tragedy have repercussions?"
"He must be around here somewhere."
"That's what I was planning to do."
"That's what we said."
"Did you want to talk to me about something?"
"Did you tell your father?"
"I have a lot of work to do."
"They don't need you anymore."
"What did you find in him?"
"See what you can get out of it."
"I know what you must be thinking."
"No, it wasn't like that."
"I wonder what he's doing."
"I'll get involved if I want."
"Do you know what I'm going to order?"
"And I have the right to speak."
"I know what he means."
"Is there anyone at home?"
"What could I have seen her in?"
"If you can call it that."
"Don't tell me he's good."
"We had a great time together."
"If you want to go, go."
"He is the father of my children."
"You're all he has."
"I want to hear it from you."
"We have a lot of things to do."
"I was there when it happened."
"You taught me."
"It's your word against mine."
"I will be back as soon as possible."
"There's one for you."
"Is anyone listening to me?"
"Who elected you gang leader?"
"But I have to tell you something."
"You just have to say it."
"I don't think I can do it."
"What do you offer me?"
"You did what you had to."
"And you, the trigger ace?"
"Shall we share breakfast first?"
"Thank you, that's very kind of you."
"I'll say that you called."
"Think about what I said."
"Do you know what we have to do?"
"I wanted to apologize for last night."
"That's where I want to go."
"That's very thoughtful of you."
"But that's ancient history."
"You think I did that?"
"Do you want me to tell you why?"
"How could you do this to him?"
"What happened to the American dream?"
"We both did it."
"He was very kind to me."
"What am I going to wear?"
"She didn't come home last night."
"The light slid north."
"I hoped it wouldn't come to that."
"What did you do to my son?"
"I didn't expect this ending."
"Let's see what he has to say."
"No, I'm not like that."
"This is exactly what I feared."
"I have a cat in my throat."
"At least, what's left of it."
"When can I get my own horse?"
"You did all this for me?"
"I've never seen you there."
"That's all he has."
"Is it yours or mine?"
"I put out a search notice."
"I knew I'd find you there."
"Embrace the destiny that is yours."
"That's very noble of you."
"What do you have to say to that?"
"There is no road."
"She doesn't know anything."
"Haven't you heard about it?"
"I don't feel so good."
"I know what you're capable of."
"I waited for you all night."
"With you, in one of your adventures."
"But it's up to you to decide."
"What did he ever do to her?"
"I don't want her here."
"Do you realize what that means?"
"So do what I tell you."
"What are you doing, honey?"
"Say something, please."
"That's what I read."
"I was in Avatar training with him."
"I'll call you when I'm done."
"How dare you talk to me like that?"
"There may be something else."
"That's what we meant."
"I feel like we're going to have fun."
"I thought you might be hungry."
"Repeat what you just said."
"Anyone have anything to say?"
"I don't know, I'll see."
"We'll make it work."
"Take your things and go."
"She seemed fine."
"How do you know it's him?"
"Do you think this task is yours?"
"It's in the middle of nowhere."
"It was a pleasure to see you again."
"You know what's going on."
"She didn't make it."
"The lights of the Holiday Tree."
"And that's about it."
"I'll give it back to you in an hour."
"So what is love?"
"There's just you and me."
"I will do whatever you say."
"There is a price to pay."
"That's exactly what it is."
"Do you know who it is?"
"Everyone is making fun of me."
"Wait, I have something for you."
"I have another gift for you."
"Call me if you have any news."
"Someone needs to talk to him."
"Come give me a hand."
"Do you think that's why?"
"The Master must enter the tunnel."
"I've been back for weeks."
"Thank you for what you did."
"I'm fed up."
"I got the hang of it."
"You know I like you."
"That's how we play."
"This is what we must do."
"What do you bring me?"
"You'll need it more than I will."
"I would like to talk to you about something."
"Yes, I already told you."
"There's something for everyone."
"I manage very well on my own."
"A lot has happened."
"Can I hug you?"
"It's not just her."
"Where do you think she is?"
"That's all it was."
"I know exactly what I want."
"I know what I need to know."
"Is there any other way out?"
"You had a car accident."
"It's just another day."
"They have to decide how to end it."
"No, you're not going to do that."
"He who sows the wind reaps the whirlwind."
"Is it someone's birthday?"
"Millions of lives are at stake."
"The dwelling place of his spirit is crumbling."
"It's an hour from here."
"I think about her all the time."
"And now, something completely different."
"This is the reason for my call."
"Take back what you just said."
"No, there aren't any more."
"I have two words to say to him."
"Yes, that's what I do."
"I know it's been hard."
"I need a small favor."
"What are you giving me?"
"Is that what you meant?"
"But there is hope."
"What if we don't?"
"I think we should get married."
"Wouldn't you be my family?"
"Let's see what's inside."
"That's what my father used to say."
"I have a better job for you."
"What should I see?"
"I know you saw it."
"Do with me what you want."
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
"That's what pays for all this."
"Not while we have strength."
"I know what we have to do."
"It's your word against his."
"What do you like to do?"
"I have a few questions for him."
"Did you find something interesting?"
"I think this is the end."
"I want to know more about you."
"That's what men do."
"I try to do my best."
"I'll tell my father."
"You only have it by chance."
"But that is not the point."
"Do you think he did it?"
"Maybe I did."
"I could tell you the same thing."
"I think this is the right one."
"What did you put?"
"Because the mirror shows many things."
"I thought you didn't drink."
"Tell him I want to talk to him."
"What if he's not there?"
"I can never give it back to you."
"No one deserves it more than you."
"I didn't order pizza."
"I am a friend of your father."
"Doctor, what is it?"
"Can I ask you another question?"
"I'm really glad to see you."
"How did I not think of that?"
"You think I'm going to believe that?"
"No, I'm not going to do that."
"Listen to what I have to say."
"He said you would say that."
"I read the police report."
"Is that supposed to tell me something?"
"It was my word against his."
"It's like I'm there."
"I really had a good time."
"I'll give you some good advice."
"Do you know what they did?"
"That's my mother's name."
"Do you have what you need?"
"Do you think he saw us?"
"I know I did it."
"My phone keeps ringing."
"I read an article about it."
"I have one more thing to do."
"That's what I tell him."
"I ask you to trust me."
"I wanted to take the Ring from him."
"It's just a piece of paper."
"What does it bring you?"
"You know I love you too?"
"I see what I can do."
"I know who is behind all this."
"Line up like everyone else."
"No, I have things to do."
"Where are the horse and rider?"
"I only trust you."
"There is good in him."
"But I was lucky."
"I only have you in the world."
"Do you know what that does to me?"
"I think he did."
"And that's what I want."
"She's not quite sane anymore."
"They are all I have."
"This is how we survive."
"It was a gift from my father."
"But what the hell are they doing?"
"No one knows you're here."
"Is this what you really want?"
"That's what you have to do."
"It's all smoke and mirrors."
"He is the chief of police."
"You won't need this anymore."
"Where is the rest of your team?"
"You know what I meant."
"It will be, my dear friend."
"I know what I need."
"He said it was personal."
"But what do you think?"
"I want to make love with you."
"He is a friend of my father."
"I can give you money."
"I read it in a magazine."
"Isn't that already the case?"
"I thought that was the case."
"You have been assigned this task."
"I knew you wouldn't understand."
"I'm sure it was you."
"I want to make a phone call."
"It's a pleasure to have you."
"I know exactly what it is."
"Do you know what you can do?"
"Take care of each other."
"That's what I needed."
"No, I'm the one who thanks you."
"You've never looked so beautiful."
"Not good taste at all, my darling."
"But something happened."
"Do you know what I need?"
"I need to go home."
"This is what the prophecy says."
"I think I have the solution."
"What is it, my heart?"
"What was I going to do?"
"I think this is for you."
"Are you sure it's okay?"
"Do you want me to read it to you?"
"But I'm glad to see you."
"You don't remember him?"
"There's another one here."
"I told him the same thing."
"Is there anything to eat?"
"Because she told me so."
"What happened to your father?"
"Do you think I have a choice?"
"What happened to his face?"
"He told me to do it."
"I have to take you home."
"I hope you change your mind."
"Looks like you're having fun."
"Don't leave me in the dark."
"No, you're not going to do it."
"How far are you willing to go?"
"So what has changed?"
"I told you I'd come."
"I was the first on the scene."
"Yes, you already told me."
"Do you know what he's going to do?"
"Can we know what's going on?"
"We can do this all day."
"I have already given the order."
"Do you want to do something for me?"
"You owe someone an apology."
"People do it all the time."
"What could have happened to him?"
"I think you should do it."
"Tell him we have to go."
"No, you didn't do that."
"It wasn't love."
"Is there anything we can do for you?"
"There's no accounting for taste."
"I knew it wouldn't work."
"What if I need to go to the bathroom?"
"You're only young once."
"I feel like I know her."
"They are operating on him."
"Tell us everything you know."
"I just want her to be happy."
"Do you see something you like?"
"Not after what you did."
"It was a one-night stand."
"Nobody knows what's going on."
"I really had a good evening."
"I want another cup of coffee."
"But you did it anyway."
"I'm just saying it's possible."
"If it is not?"
"You are the man of the house."
"They are not on the list."
"Is this the role of the cigarette?"
"I owe you an apology, my King."
"Both of you come to my office."
"That's not the point."
"You should talk to someone about this."
"You will do as you are told."
"Thank you for agreeing to speak with me."
"How could you let this happen?"
"I need an ID."
"What did I get?"
"I did as you said."
"Don't you dare do that."
"No, I didn't tell him."
"Can I know what you are doing?"
"What happened to my mother?"
"What is there to explain?"
"Is that what you were thinking?"
"I've done it many times."
"I need time for myself."
"That's all we had."
"This is how it all began."
"Tell him I want to see him."
"No, you're more beautiful than ever."
"Let's see what she has to say."
"I'll see what he wants."
"That's what my mother used to say."
"You are blessed among all women."
"You look hungry."
"I told you on the phone."
"I suspected you'd be here."
"I'll bring you a glass of water."
"Will we have an early spring?"
"She's not a little girl anymore."
"Can we have some privacy?"
"Thousands of lives are at stake."
"I want to be with you forever."
"I know very well who you are."
"It suits you better than it does me."
"Actually, there is something."
"Give me the car keys."
"You understand that, don't you?"
"I'll only ask once."
"There must be a good reason."
"Does it get easier?"
"You are more and more beautiful."
"Can I see your ID card?"
"I am a great admirer of yours."
"Is it good for everyone?"
"I took a day off."
"Do you think I'll believe you?"
"I have important things to do."
"He heard his Master calling him."
"People want value for their money."
"You better get on with it."
"Room for everyone."
"Try reading my mind again."
"This is where you belong."
"At dawn, look east."
"She's right next to me."
"I need to take a shower."
"She's someone's daughter."
"He knew it was time."
"I took a look."
"I'm sorry, but it's true."
"I know what can be done."
"That's what you do, right?"
"What did he want from you?"
"I can't say it."
"I finish what I started."
"No, he didn't say that."
"No, I didn't tell him anything."
"I know, you told me."
"But I want something in return."
"He is in the bathroom."
"I have to go anyway."
"Do you want me to make you laugh?"
"No, I don't want to do that."
"Do you want me to go get her?"
"Because I'm in love with you."
"It is the most important meal."
"Where is the rest of the crew?"
"Of course I saw it."
"I'll do what it takes."
"I may have had a Leroy."
"One month is enough to get to know them well."
"Yes, that's what I see."
"There's nothing up there."
"Do you have something to tell us?"
"Can't it wait until tomorrow morning?"
"There is no war."
"Nod your head if you can hear me."
"That's all he cares about."
"I'll tell him you came by."
"I know what he's capable of."
"Yes, I think you're right."
"You know I'm going to do it."
"You have your mother's eyes."
"Do you want to hug him?"
"That's what we all want."
"I can't do that here."
"Tell me what you remember."
"I just needed to see you."
"That's what we should do."
"I said I loved you."
"I don't go to school."
"I'll tell my mother."
"I was sure you spoke English."
"I know what's up."
"I didn't get a response."
"I have a little business to attend to."
"Is it because of your father?"
"I never had a father."
"Do you have any money on you?"
"Is it still good for tonight?"
"I've never seen her before."
"That's what I was wondering."
"Of course there are."
"Everything you say is true."
"I want you to leave here."
"You can't do that to him."
"I never did anything to you."
"I read this in a magazine."
"This is the one I want."
"I read that in the newspaper."
"Is that what I'm thinking?"
"Can we postpone this?"
"We all have a role to play."
"I have eyes in the back of my head."
"I have to take him to the hospital."
"I take the first turn on guard."
"I read it in his eyes."
"I never knew my parents."
"This is what pays for your research."
"It's like he disappeared."
"Do you have family there?"
"I was just passing by, that's all."
"We look out for each other."
"What will it give?"
"What's so special about it?"
"The police have it."
"There was more to it than that."
"That's all they have."
"There is a change of program."
"She is a friend of the family."
"And behind that door, your own office."
"Those are his words, not mine."
"It's a sleight of hand."
"It's the same as mine."
"What happened this morning?"
"I need more information."
"You will be the Fellowship of the Ring."
"I told you it would happen."
"Someone I trust."
"If that's what you think."
"It was there when I arrived."
"Is that all you wanted?"
"It's okay, the way is clear."
"There could be others."
"He's been wanting to hang me for a while."
"You are the father of my child."
"Friends, that's what it's for."
"How long were you married?"
"This is of the utmost importance."
"I have a lot of respect for you."
"What can you tell us about him?"
"I thought that was in the past."
"This is the third time this week."
"For once, we agree."
"You must do what I say."
"It's because he loves you."
"They seem to be having fun."
"Here, at the end of all things."
"We are all children of God."
"I know you have questions."
"Who put you on the case?"
"You'll know it when you see it."
"Have you ever been with a woman?"
"I think we should do it."
"The world will have to deal with us."
"I want to know what you are doing."
"That's what it's all about."
"At least we have that in common."
"You're the one I wanted to see."
"They are on a war footing."
"A year and a half ago."
"The door was locked from the inside."
"What happened to these people?"
"I want you to do something."
"It's good to see you again too."
"I can, and I will."
"I've been calling you all morning."
"We're going to take a tour of the neighborhood."
"How kind of him."
"I suspected it was you."
"You don't want me to stay?"
"Do you think he's still here?"
"Did you make them?"
"It's my wedding day."
"One more step and I shoot."
"One for all and all for one."
"I knew I was forgetting something."
"This is the shortest way."
"You look fine."
"Everyone was very kind."
"There is no boy."
"I just wanted to know how you were doing."
"I'm the one who should be thanking you."
"Dude, what the hell are you doing?"
"It will take as long as it takes."
"You do what you're told."
"Want to know what you're playing for?"
"What else did you hide from me?"
"I need you to focus."
"I saw it in action."
"Did someone say something to you?"
"I said I'd think about it."
"ID card, please."
"I remember you like this."
"I tried to dissuade him."
"You thought I wouldn't know?"
"It's in everyone's interest."
"You have something between your teeth."
"You look like you're having fun."
"He can say whatever he wants."
"I have a wife and two children."
"You are like a son to me."
"Because I don't love you."
"I think we should talk about it."
"I need to take some samples."
"Calm down, everything will be okay."
"I have a little something for you."
"I always say what I think."
"How will they know we're here?"
"I have a wife and a daughter."
"Tell them what happened."
"It was up to me to do it."
"The whole planet is one huge city."
"I knew you'd change your mind."
"I'll tell them where I am tomorrow."
"I improvise as I go along."
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
"You know what would make me happy?"
"What was inside?"
"As if he never existed."
"That's one way to look at it."
"No one ever told me that."
"It's important for everyone."
"Of course I trust you."
"Is there room for me?"
"But you didn't answer me."
"This is a great day for us."
"He's the one we need."
"Everyone knows it, except you."
"Which he didn't do."
"What makes us human?"
"What happened to my family?"
"I dream of taking samples there."
"Have you heard about my work?"
"You could have played a big role."
"She is the love of my life."
"I'll know when I see it."
"I'm going to get something to eat."
"I am very happy to be here."
"You may want to change your statement."
"Call me if you change your mind."
"What did you do to my brother?"
"Call me if you have any questions."
"I got your support."
"There's going to be action."
"It's up to you to wake up."
"And they will do the same thing here."
"The final step in becoming a man."
"There is something written."
"Are you trying to tell me something?"
"How do you intend to protect me with this?"
"Is this the life you want?"
"I want everything to go well."
"I believe this is yours."
"It's the price of fame."
"Am I my brother's keeper?"
"How was your first day?"
"You know I don't drink."
"You just have to go there."
"What would I say to him?"
"Would you mind doing me a favor?"
"That's what I want to see."
"Tell us what you saw."
"No, I don't want to talk about it."
"Do you think you're one of them?"
"Okay, what do we have?"
"No photos, please."
"Let's find a way out of here."
"What does he tell you?"
"It's nice of you to come see me."
"I'll do what I want with it."
"What else could I have done?"
"Did you see a man running?"
"I always dreamed of going there."
"And to whom do I have the honor?"
"He will be the inheritance of my kingdom."
"You're the one who's going to listen to me."
"How will I know if he chooses me?"
"I thought it was a dream."
"I love you and always will."
"I want to see it closer."
"That's very kind of you, sir."
"Is there anything for me?"
"Engine control looks good."
"All Na'vi know this story."
"Who else could have done this?"
"Can I have a hand?"
"Your mother must be proud of you."
"I will do it if necessary."
"You know what I thought?"
"I hope I'm not late."
"No, I've never seen her."
"On the other side of the hill."
"I know some things you don't."
"It's the most beautiful gift."
"I can't do anything more for you."
"I'm sure it's true."
"I heard the gunshots."
"You just have to say yes."
"The Ring is still in your pocket."
"That's all he wants."
"Almost the entire world population."
"Have you seen anyone else?"
"That's not it either."
"I still have some shopping to do."
"The opportunity to have your sentence reduced."
"I think I love you too."
"Nobody knows what it is."
"But what do they want?"
"I think I remember that."
"What do I have to do with it?"
"I'll see where they are."
"Did you just realize that?"
"I am very glad to see you."
"I remember our first meeting."
"What happened to the other one?"
"I think he chose you."
"To do what we are told."
"They say you are the best."
"And how do you plan to do this?"
"For everything I've done."
"What are the chances of this happening?"
"I've always dreamed of saying that."
"I must come in with you."
"You did well to call us."
"Do you remember your marriage proposal?"
"There was a short circuit."
"I want the same thing as you."
"I make do with what I have."
"Do you want me to come pick you up?"
"I told the police."
"Watch and learn from it."
"It was three days ago."
"Reaction time comes into play."
"Of course I have one."
"I apologize for the other day."
"It is their most sacred sanctuary."
"I want to know what you think."
"Tell us what to do."
"Do you know the make of his car?"
"I'm about to leave."
"He is very proud of his work."
"I think it's mine."
"I know what happened to him."
"They kindly asked him for his papers."
"What have you done with my daughter?"
"I wanted to apologize for this morning."
"Can I use your bathroom?"
"Do you want a quarter of an hour?"
"I would have done exactly the same thing."
"It's closing time."
"There's something over there."
"You are like a brother to me."
"Tell him to go to hell."
"It was easier than I thought."
"No, I didn't say it."
"The kid has it."
"The best at what he does."
"Is anyone on board?"
"Listen, here's what we're going to do."
"You give me goosebumps."
"I can handle this on my own."
"You told us you love music."
"You're saying that to make me leave."
"I have another mission for you."
"No, I haven't seen them."
"Do you have anything to tell me?"
"Sorry for earlier."
"What did you do with your time?"
"See you at dinner, kids."
"He just told them his name."
"This is the only one I have."
"Is this what you want to do?"
"Let me get my toothbrush."
"I don't think about anything else."
"I didn't expect to find you here."
"She knew I was talking to the colonel."
"It's up to the judge to decide."
"I wonder what he's thinking."
"I've never had so much fun."
"I'm glad you're okay."
"I want it to be the present."
"I have been all my life."
"But that was just a theory."
"Is this a test?"
"You're going to do something for me."
"I want us to get back together."
"That's how he does it."
"Is James Cole one of your patients?"
"Call me when you get this message."
"Look what you're making me do."
"I only thought of you."
"Didn't you forget something?"
"I'd bet my life on it."
"We are back to square one."
"Only a few were chosen to stay."
"I have the man for the job."
"You shouldn't think like that."
"You, what are you doing?"
"I think I would remember that."
"She said she would be there."
"That was nine years ago."
"Don't interfere in my private life."
"My little finger told me so."
"Is there anything there?"
"I keep telling you."
"Who taught you how to do that?"
"You are better than me at everything."
"It's over, they took it."
"Can I see your ID?"
"I have to get out of this."
"It's good to see you all."
"Listen carefully to what I'm telling you."
"No, I wasn't talking about that."
"That was two hours ago."
"Do you want to know what's going on?"
"I mean what I said."
"Stay with me, please."
"Come with me if you want to live."
"Dad, can I ask you a question?"
"It's you I want to see."
"You weren't supposed to see this."
"It's true that he is handsome."
"How many questions does it usually take?"
"I never asked you."
"Is he talking to me?"
"That's when I knew."
"I've known you all my life."
"The best driver I've seen?"
"No, I don't need anything."
"That was twenty years ago."
"For the first time in my life."
"Every night it's the same thing."
"This is what I don't understand."
"I can take you on my team."
"I found something interesting."
"That's very kind of you to say."
"I need to do something."
"We're going to do this the old-fashioned way."
"But all that is in the past."
"No, that's what I'm saying."
"Do you know what I want?"
"I have to get started."
"What does she want from me?"
"There is more to it than that."
"No, but you're going to tell me."
"I said I would think about it."
"He asked me to do it."
"The fresh air will do you good."
"Who's next on the list?"
"I'm sure you're right."
"Is it a male or a female?"
"I cannot answer this question."
"My father was an exceptional man."
"I want to see this more closely."
"What's his last name?"
"I'm sure you are."
"What did we miss?"
"He has a wife and children."
"She always needs to feed."
"I did it for your own good."
"What are you doing here at this hour?"
"This is the purpose of my visit."
"I appreciate what you did."
"You're going to do just fine."
"You are the only one I love."
"Send it to someone else."
"It's because of my father."
"She looks healthy."
"That's what we said to each other."
"I talked to everyone."
"No one knows this better than me."
"And you are wiser than me."
"What do you think you know?"
"I was wondering what it was."
"We grew up in the same neighborhood."
"There are gunshots."
"He never knew his father."
"I want to see it with my own eyes."
"Can't you or don't you want to?"
"I have to know the truth."
"So what do you want me to do?"
"You're going to have to train your left hand."
"I have cash and cards."
"The idea crossed my mind."
"You haven't told anyone about this?"
"You didn't tell anyone about it?"
"She didn't say anything else?"
"No, I'm not going to do it."
"This is the second time this week."
"This is happening now."
"What did we find?"
"He has a sense of humor."
"Now you have your kid of a wife."
"Who knows what he's capable of?"
"I can't really talk about it."
"I have a taxi waiting for me."
"Please try to understand."
"There was a small accident."
"What happened to your voice?"
"That's exactly what I believe."
"Are you sure they're here?"
"It's a gift from my daughter."
"I came to see how you were doing."
"I brought you some water."
"There are others here."
"He was all I had."
"I should have done this sooner."
"There's a first for everything."
"War is war."
"Are you the one who called me?"
"A songbird and an old hat."
"Maybe you are one too."
"I have two reservations for Key West."
"But here's what I'm going to do."
"Do you know why she did that?"
"I came to tell you something."
"What happened to the car?"
"He asked me to replace him."
"I've only ever loved you."
"It's the times that demand it."
"I told you it was fine."
"More than you will ever know."
"I never told you that."
"You don't need them."
"I think someone is following me."
"But we didn't."
"There must be another way out."
"You are the one who should be congratulated."
"No, that can't be it."
"You can't say otherwise."
"I know, he told me."
"I know what we need."
"There is some truth in that."
"No, it wasn't an accident."
"You are the Ring-bearer."
"I'm going to be a little late."
"Tomorrow is a big day for you."
"Is there another solution?"
"Show them what you can do."
"I need you to stay here."
"Isn't that what we do?"
"No, I can't say that."
"I'll have a glass of water."
"How many times do I have to repeat this?"
"I'd better get back to it."
"You have something I want."
"So what are we looking for?"
"Do you mind if I sit down?"
"I always wanted to tell you."
"What happened tonight?"
"It's time for prayer."
"I want to go for a walk."
"How did it go this morning?"
"He is my son's father."
"What are you going to imagine?"
"It's true that she is beautiful."
"No, I never thought about it."
"I would be happy to talk to him about it."
"You know I care about you."
"What happened to your wife?"
"Can I see you in my office?"
"Maybe you clean carpets."
"Tell mom I love her."
"What does this tell us?"
"I thought it was going well."
"Is there still time?"
"I'm happy where I am."
"You don't remember me anymore?"
"She doesn't answer her cell phone."
"I made the decision to act."
"The council authorizes me to train you."
"I should have done it myself."
"I have never seen this woman."
"This is my life's work."
"Did you stay there all night?"
"It's like looking in a mirror."
"A term of courtesy in this establishment."
"I'll let you say goodbye."
"Have you ever been with a prince?"
"Did you find what you wanted?"
"Tell the children I love them."
"Because I am a good observer."
"What happened to my house?"
"It didn't happen that way."
"I'm going to ask you to open it."
"After all he's done?"
"I'll see if it's available."
"Oh, I have something for you."
"What did you do to your hand?"
"But we don't have time."
"I saw how you looked at her."
"You think I didn't understand?"
"Do you want to know how I did it?"
"I only ask one thing of you."
"It's you I'm asking."
"When I was little, on TV."
"Which port do they intend to embark from?"
"I had to tell someone."
"There has to be a first time for everything."
"You caught his eye."
"That's all he had."
"It's time to get started."
"I think we should split up."
"Now there are beasts everywhere."
"This campaign is a game for them."
"Is this your way of apologizing?"
"She didn't tell me anything about it."
"Do you think it's that easy?"
"There is a lot to do here."
"I'm ahead of you."
"I found out what it is."
"I'll be back in an hour or two."
"It's between my wife and me."
"What did you feel?"
"I agree with you, the advice is."
"How long will he stay?"
"I chose a mortal life."
"I know you like him."
"I saw it in a movie."
"There were many deaths."
"She seems to be doing better."
"Where were you when it happened?"
"She looked me in the eyes."
"Haven't you been watching TV?"
"What's with the gunshots?"
"Can I call, please?"
"How long have they been there?"
"I tell it like it is."
"My destiny will be that of our people."
"He is the light of my life."
"I saw him last week."
"That was my father's name."
"No, I've never seen them."
"What do you think I did?"
"It's time to tell the truth."
"No, I have nothing to hide."
"We only did it once."
"Tell me if you accept my terms."
"Let's see what you look like."
"I want to know what he knows."
"It's up to you to tell him."
"I hope you don't mind."
"I've never had a wife."
"No, it's not just that."
"But they didn't."
"He created your mind, your brain."
"It's time for her to get married."
"The most exciting secret in the world."
"You've changed quite a bit too."
"That's why I chose you."
"My head is just spinning."
"Was I not clear enough?"
"I'm telling you I'm fine."
"Politics is the art of the practical."
"That's how I feel too."
"You've never heard of it?"
"There may be survivors."
"You tried to tell me."
"That's all that impresses them."
"That's what was wonderful."
"What is the word I am looking for?"
"As teeth go, so bones go."
"Over a year ago."
"I know what you're doing here."
"He's the man for the job."
"Yes, and they said your name."
"Do I have something on my face?"
"What happened to my father?"
"Did she tell you where she was going?"
"I've never heard a story like this."
"My Lady, you need to eat."
"This is where we have to go."
"You have to feel that inside you."
"I see what's going on here."
"The little one is strong, that's for sure."
"I said I was a cop."
"Actually, I write for cinema."
"I thought you should know that."
"He made fun of my old man."
"You're both working tonight."
"It is my most precious possession."
"I feel closer to you."
"Is that what happened to you?"
"No, but I've heard about it."
"I tried to talk to you about it."
"I work for the Attorney General's office."
"It'll be okay, I promise."
"She was all I had."
"I've been waiting for you all day."
"It's an order from above."
"I want you to listen to me carefully."
"I'm sure we'll see each other again."
"I thought it was the right one."
"She looks in great shape."
"You're not a little girl anymore."
"Is this someone from school?"
"How far up the river are we going?"
"It is an honor to welcome you."
"I think that's my mother."
"You think I'll believe that?"
"I have to take care of some things."
"I have some things to tell you."
"Who told you to come here?"
"He was stabbed in the throat."
"They live inside me?"
"Do what you do best."
"I saw him through the window."
"I know you want to kiss me."
"That's what it seems to me."
"No, he didn't say it."
"She did this to herself."
"I just say what I think."
"I'm so glad to see you again."
"Someone grabbed him from the ground."
"The garrison of Rome sets up camp."
"I'll take him home."
"Is that really how you feel?"
"No, what are you doing?"
"War awaits you, not victory."
"It made me want to throw up."
"Are you with us or against us?"
"It's time for plan B."
"Do you think this is the boy?"
"My place and my future are here."
"I need to call my wife."
"Call me if you find anything."
"Anyway, that's my opinion."
"I know what you've been through."
"It's really happening."
"How could he do this to me?"
"I have another one for you."
"Is this what you've become?"
"How many times do I have to say this?"
"Of course she did."
"What do you think that means?"
"That's what we agreed."
"I need to talk to you before you leave.'"
"What, what's going on?"
"How did we get to this point?"
"He must know what he is doing."
"This is what I discovered."
"I never left the country."
"I've never seen anything like this before."
"The sweetest grapes on earth."
"Do you want to screw everything up?"
"When will it stop?"
"I wanted to tell you myself."
"What are you waiting for, Dad?"
"I've been around the world."
"I'm watching it."
"I already told you, right?"
"We have the situation well under control."
"He is good, the Mountain is."
"It's true, I saw it."
"Is that what you want to know?"
"It was never a question."
"What was happening in your dream?"
"What did you do to my father?"
"I see you've met."
"It's as dark as an oven."
"Open your mouth, please."
"And you didn't do any of them."
"Give them bread and their freedom."
"Could I have a glass of water?"
"It's you I wanted to see."
"There are some very good ones."
"Hence the importance of his capture."
"No, I can't believe it."
"Can we talk about it when I get back?"
"I am the most virtuous in Rome."
"Now he wants us."
"You seem in a good mood."
"Did you get laid?"
"I prefer not to talk about that."
"The most pleasant miracle in the world."
"Did she say what she wanted?"
"Will they be able to penetrate their protective field?"
"You did what you wanted."
"There's no question of taking the queen there."
"I think my eyes are better."
"What would I have done?"
"You'll have to run over me."
"No, we're not going to do that."
"We agreed, right?"
"Something happened here."
"Look what you did to him."
"I did what I wanted."
"It's time I went."
"What do they want from us?"
"That's all I wish for."
"I know someone who does."
"If your number comes up, we'll find you."
"You can take me whenever you want."
"What made you decide?"
"This is exactly what is needed."
"You have nothing else to say?"
"That's how you grow up."
"How will you determine who is homosexual?"
"What is the password?"
"I'm right next to you."
"If only I could do something."
"I need to speak to the commander for a moment."
"How long will it take for them to arrive?"
"What do I always say?"
"Remember what we said."
"It's good that you're back."
"It's like a fairy tale."
"I have the right to see him."
"I know you need it."
"You can have whatever you want."
"I think it's better this way."
"As if I was going to tell you."
"Is that how you do it?"
"Just like old times, right?"
"Do you see what I did?"
"You know what I have to do."
"You can take your wives with you."
"I can see it on your face."
"She got what she wanted."
"We are doing it."
"You have to fly on your own."
"He's the one you need."
"There's something up there."
"She told me the same thing."
"It's my word against his."
"She didn't need it."
"That's who I was talking to."
"And then, I feel good here."
"Thank you for all you do."
"That's what we do, right?"
"They also left you a CD."
"What the hell are you doing, old man?"
"I wonder what she wants."
"I wasn't up to it."
"When you're right, you're right."
"That's what makes it so charming."
"I told you to get up."
"I don't need it now."
"Is there one for me?"
"We have to get her out of there."
"I told you to be careful."
"It has the merit of being clear."
"It may already be the case."
"You'd better go home."
"Are you done with my wife?"
"I believe I can do it."
"Of course I saw her."
"And it will start again, again and again."
"It's his sense of humor."
"He's not there either."
"What can I do for you, Inspector?"
"After what you did to me?"
"Can you tell me where we're going?"
"We did the right thing."
"I didn't tell him that."
"It could have been anything."
"I saw you on television."
"Come down and show me your safe conduct."
"I should have told you about this before."
"I heard what you were saying."
"She never told me anything."
"What was I imagining?"
"Was it a boy or a girl?"
"Did you take them?"
"It's a surprise, remember that."
"Did you give up?"
"You can't do that here."
"He did this to himself."
"I'm going to make you a star."
"If you only knew how much I love you."
"What does that imply?"
"Except it isn't."
"I have never seen a ballet."
"But we have to get out of here."
"No, we can't do that."
"It's my father's birthday."
"A drop in the ocean."
"I've read some stuff about it."
"I like you both."
"You disobeyed a direct order."
"Come on, you can do better than that."
"We have plenty of time for that."
"Who told you to do it?"
"I just had a great idea."
"Don't you have another idea?"
"I'm trying to tell you something."
"I think she's upstairs."
"But we need money."
"I wonder where it comes from."
"It's beyond my means."
"I told you to wait outside."
"I know there are some."
"Give me everything you have."
"I have something to offer you."
"Of course, you named your sword."
"I need to see someone."
"Don't you want another one?"
"It was just like old times."
"Is that all you're saying?"
"Are you going to stay here all day?"
"I'm so happy to see you again."
"You have to look at it like that."
"But it's you I want."
"There is a price on my head too."
"Is that the case?"
"And what do you feel?"
"I never thought it was possible."
"Do you want to know how I feel?"
"It is in my mother's name."
"Did you mean what you said?"
"Go see somewhere else if I'm there."
"You have an idea in mind."
"No one is more diligent than you."
"That's all I'll say."
"I will do what you tell me."
"And that's what happened."
"It's time for your medicine."
"You have the keys."
"I painted it."
"Thanks for getting me out of there."
"I knew you would agree."
"If you have to leave, now is the time."
"We found what we were looking for."
"What do you think I'm going to do?"
"You're never home."
"Have you talked to your mother about this?"
"I want to do the right thing."
"This is the moment I've been waiting for."
"As if we needed that."
"I wonder what that means."
"I made a deal with them."
"It looks in good condition."
"What do we do, boss?"
"To talk and walk like us."
"There is something else at stake."
"Nobody knows you're here."
"I will do it if you do it."
"I have something important to do."
"It's a gift from my husband."
"How good it is to be free."
"I have so much to do."
"Looks like you need it."
"He has his father's eyes."
"I'm glad I met you."
"I'm surprised you believe it."
"I had a great time tonight."
"He just wanted me to replace you."
"That's what I'm doing now."
"Honey, I'm so proud of you."
"It's just the two of you?"
"It must be my lucky day."
"I never want to talk to you again."
"No, he didn't do that."
"I can't ask him that."
"I think I have the flu."
"I apologize for being late."
"No, I can't go."
"No idea what it is."
"I put it back in its place."
"It was nice working with you."
"She ended her life."
"Not a word, please."
"What does it cost you?"
"I know what happened to you."
"Everyone get involved."
"He was the one who hired me."
"Can you explain to me what's going on?"
"I will do whatever is necessary."
"I let everyone down."
"I will take care of it in due course."
"Listen to my voice, come back to the light."
"I didn't say that either."
"Actually, there is something else."
"I need to be with you."
"One for you and one for me."
"No, it's never too late."
"Give your father a real kiss."
"I think we'll go."
"I know what we should do."
"I've taken up enough of your time."
"Are you sure that's all?"
"Who told you where I was?"
"Can we have a bigger army?"
"I think they called him Spartacus."
"As I am treated, I treat others."
"What did you imagine?"
"I came here to see you."
"I just want us to be friends."
"I thought it was already done."
"Thanks for saving my ass."
"I suggest you do the same."
"I'm sworn to secrecy."
"You think I won't do it?"
"You seem confident."
"This is a case of self-defense."
"I'll see if it's possible."
"There are plenty of them around here."
"We can do this another time."
"Thank you for coming all this way."
"You can take whatever you want."
"He was the one who attacked me."
"But there are others."
"We'll see what he thinks."
"I have everything you want."
"She has her mother's eyes."
"Glad you changed your mind."
"It's an old family recipe."
"She's the one who left me."
"The bigger the better."
"It's the truth, I swear."
"That's what I have to say."
"I like it when the candles are lit."
"How is this good news?"
"I really want to kiss you."
"I've been here for half an hour."
"I just need a second."
"Well, that's good news."
"Look what they gave me."
"No, it's not mine."
"They said it on TV."
"I am the head of security."
"What do they want from you?"
"The sun rises in an hour."
"On the first day of my new life."
"That's what we planned."
"Look over here, please."
"She is the one who needs to be replaced."
"He has as many reasons as you do."
"It was the chance of a lifetime."
"No, I don't want money."
"We're halfway there."
"And I fucked both of them."
"I'd better get on with it."
"I have two men in the hospital."
"And the sooner the better."
"I was the one who asked him."
"Did you spend the night with her?"
"I'm sure he will."
"No, we didn't."
"No, there weren't any."
"So there is hope."
"I need to know one thing."
"There's always something, right?"
"It's the first step that costs."
"I want him to go away."
"Do you think you're old enough for that?"
"I heard what happened."
"I told the police everything."
"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
"If they are here, we will find them."
"What are you doing, son?"
"If only that were all."
"I'm in the middle of nowhere."
"She's here, isn't she?"
"That was an hour ago."
"Throw it into one of the black cells."
"Entry code, please."
"And I'll tell you something."
"I heard you the first time."
"How long will it take you?"
"What do you have again?"
"I take my work very seriously."
"Do you want to know what I do?"
"I want you to trust me."
"I've already told you about her."
"Where did you come from?"
"That's why I come."
"The Force is with you, young Skywalker."
"It is an honor to serve you."
"I was the one who called him."
"Maybe I can do something."
"I took a shower this morning."
"I did some research on you."
"So what are you?"
"Baby, what's going on?"
"But I have something for you."
"That's what families do."
"Oh, what's going on?"
"It only exists on paper."
"Your father and I were very close."
"I have something to do first."
"There's a word for that."
"Barry reported regularly to the minister."
"It's at the end of the street."
"I've always been proud of you."
"I tell him you're here."
"I've never seen so many."
"You don't know how to spell 'bodyguard'?"
"You asked me to do it."
"But we are the king's men."
"I've only been a cop for eight months."
"Who dares to paint my roses red?"
"From what I heard."
"He was a friend of my father."
"Pass it to me, please."
"Oh, you can do better than that."
"I took them on my knees."
"I don't remember that."
"You could have at least called me back."
"We have a big day ahead of us."
"Is this where you're from?"
"Is there an instruction manual?"
"It is a place full of promise."
"I wish he had heard it."
"It's not up to you to decide."
"He said he was fine."
"I know you care about her."
"I knew it would happen one day."
"I saw a century pass."
"Good job for such a young guy."
"And the Precious One wants to return to him."
"He knows what happened."
"I think it's a boy."
"Two suits and a bag of laundry."
"There is something in her."
"You know what you said."
"You can't afford it."
"Do I have fleas in my eyes?"
"You have been declared sane."
"Can't you do something?"
"You reap what you sow."
"What have you done with my son?"
"I'll call you when it's done."
"What are you showing me?"
"Can I drink some water?"
"No, I wasn't aware."
"He always made money from it."
"This is your friend talking to you."
"I'll take him to the hospital."
"You were everything I wanted."
"How did you get this magical power?"
"What is there to eat?"
"We have guys waiting for them."
"What are you doing next weekend?"
"Well, what are you doing?"
"I'd like you to meet Matthews, the controller."
"What do we tell them?"
"As if it never happened."
"What's for dinner?"
"I think we can go."
"What is he going to say?"
"No one saw or heard anything."
"We found ourselves in the dark."
"I really wanted to see you."
"What can you tell me about her?"
"An anecdote about a drug deal."
"Maybe we'll see each other there."
"Yo, what the hell are you doing?"
"What are they doing to you?"
"You have to trust someone."
"How old was the black girl?"
"Manipulator of thought and behavior."
"I hope he's okay."
"But that's what I want."
"I am stronger than bullets."
"Come on, I have something for you."
"Do you remember your grandmother?"
"Orange has a bullet in his stomach."
"He slipped through my fingers."
"I work as fast as I can."
"I've never used it."
"What was so important?"
"I only saw one."
"I punished them both."
"Add courage to your new virtues."
"I said it was over."
"What if they aren't?"
"You know it's not going to happen."
"I'm going to sign you up for treatment."
"I love his hair thing."
"Yes, it's him and the woman."
"You're the one who scares me."
"You know what I understood?"
"Well, what are we waiting for?"
"He is always one step ahead."
"How generous of me."
"Do you know what you could do?"
"Thank you for taking care of him."
"This is just the first step."
"Can I borrow some money from you?"
"There was a cop among us."
"I thought you'd never ask."
"I saw this in a book."
"It takes a big army for that."
"I don't need a reason."
"And look what happened to him."
"There is a procedure to follow."
"Do you want a beer or something?"
"That's about to change."
"I thought you didn't want to."
"Please fasten your seatbelt."
"It's an honor to meet you."
"The best wine comes from Greece."
"I should have seen it sooner."
"Do you think I'm going to swallow that?"
"I guess you could say that."
"Yes, I remember it very well."
"Let's see what she does."
"I remember my first night."
"How kind of you."
"They have the right to do that?"
"My mission is to protect you."
"What will you say if someone comes?"
"We're going to do this for real."
"Please, it's important."
"I'm sure he's there."
"Do you think I have a chance?"
"It's been going on for a while."
"I am very happy for both of you."
"You can take it if you want."
"He made me do it."
"You never had a son."
"You're going to get a slice of it."
"I absolutely have to talk to you."
"What do you conclude from this?"
"I am one of his old friends."
"I think you already know that."
"I am a leaf in the wind."
"It seems like history is repeating itself."
"It's been going on for years."
"What will become of them?"
"Have you ever slept with a woman?"
"White and Pink, you're coming with me."
"I just got my nails done."
"I do what I know how to do."
"I know how to manage on my own very well."
"He was shot in the chest."
"This is how we filter."
"You must let me see my son."
"You really want me to say that?"
"I know how it feels."
"They got what they deserved."
"You eat when you are told to."
"And what do you want me to do?"
"Since I've existed, you've been there."
"I'll see what he knows."
"Come on Mr. White, you see this, right?"
"He held the victims in his arms."
"You say you're a man?"
"The Marine Corps wants killers."
"Did you find anything interesting?"
"I've had enough of this kid."
"You made a new friend."
"But where are we going?"
"Did I tell you to open it?"
"That's all you are."
"It's the natural order of things."
"When you are finished, enter your name."
"She's trying to tell us something."
"I have a wife and three children."
"I won't be the same there."
"Plus the kids who have to be taken for a walk."
"It's one of his good days."
"We have the right to be here."
"Do you know what they said?"
"So much has happened since then."
"Know all the details about these toilets."
"What a change he makes in a boy."
"I can see what's going on."
"Do you want to give your seat to Blake?"
"But there will be others."
"I've never been told that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience."
"Is that why you're calling?"
"I am the chief of police."
"She had nothing else to think about."
"You can and you will do it."
"I think she still loves him."
"I'll take care of all that."
"How did you know I would be here?"
"Yes, I've heard about you."
"You know what I say?"
"He kept talking, too."
"That's what he wanted to hear."
"You never came to see me."
"I think he's hiding something."
"Riot in progress over food."
"Do you know what I should do?"
"I know the day it will happen."
"It could come from anywhere."
"I'm going to tell you something important."
"I've been there, to the slaughterhouse."
"I'll go get some parts, I'll be back."
"I knew you'd say that."
"From what I've read."
"Haven't I given you everything?"
"This is what your neighbors heard."
"We've heard a lot about you."
"I should have been by your side."
"How long do I have to stay here?"
"Afterwards, I took care of him."
"And it will get better and better."
"She is the mother of my children."
"I thought it was over, Nina."
"Did you draw this?"
"I think you know the answer."
"I told you to wait for me."
"Did you have something to tell me?"
"You know very well who I am."
"Not after what we've been through."
"I am the man of the house."
"You weren't part of Operation Hastings."
"Black Swan, in place in five minutes."
"You have to take it south."
"The great one who comes from the high."
"It's from the Mexican Panda."
"Who knows what happened?"
"That's it, I said it."
"I was there, I saw everything."
"No, but you have to fill out some paperwork."
"Real estate takes up all his time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the facts."
"I was about to give up."
"I live in a shitty world, yes."
"Our father is the Hand of the King."
"How did it go for you?"
"The stronger the better."
"I made a phone call."
"I don't believe it either."
"Someone with the skills to intervene."
"I'm not going to answer that."
"It's the only one I have."
"I'm going to give you a good lesson."
"What are you going to wear?"
"I took my car back to go home."
"This is what is happening here."
"I spoke to him last week."
"Please go home."
"Have I shown signs of improvement?"
"Until you get better."
"That's all I asked."
"I was just thinking."
"They prefer life to freedom."
"A bird had entered our cage."
"What are we doing now?"
"I don't want her to know."
"Do you have time to fix it?"
"We laughed so much."
"That was his plan all along."
"But she's just a child."
"Carlos, where is Lady E tonight?"
"Yes, I guess you're right."
"You have to lower me into the tank."
"I could do whatever I wanted."
"Are you seeing anyone?"
"Do you want me to go get it?"
"Buy horses and a covered wagon."
"You should have told me about this before."
"I imagine when you were six."
"Who started talking about this?"
"You don't have to hide."
"Believe me, it's for the best."
"This period of your life is over."
"What am I going to do for you?"
"And that was just the beginning."
"Who put that into your head?"
"She didn't come this morning."
"It feels good to talk about it."
"It's time for your lesson."
"She's the one chasing me."
"Don't you know who I am?"
"I still have some business to attend to."
"You can't say the same."
"That was my mother's name."
"What did he order?"
"You haven't figured it out yet?"
"What happens tomorrow?"
"I will tell you everything I know."
"Something could have happened to him."
"We're going to have to split up."
"I have to get ready for work."
"He's the guy from the mall."
"You were brave enough like that."
"It's up to me to tell him."
"And all I have here."
"I hope I cross the border."
"That's how I do it."
"So what do we say?"
"Take this, they'll release gas."
"What did you understand?"
"I wasn't there for you."
"There was another incident."
"A tourist attraction, I told you."
"I don't think she'll come."
"You're the one doing me a favor."
"I may have found something."
"I didn't do that to him."
"And you know what it is?"
"If you are nice, I will be nice."
"She will tell you how to find Earth."
"She didn't tell anyone anything."
"You will see women of all sizes."
"It's very good for your health."
"I didn't take anything at all."
"Remember this day, little brother."
"Do you have someone in your life?"
"I turn over a hundred million a year."
"He knows a little about me."
"I never had a brother."
"Like I needed that."
"What is she doing now?"
"And what do I want?"
"I only did it once."
"I think that's the best."
"I'll give it back to you when we leave."
"That's exactly what she wants."
"There is one thing left for me to do."
"It looks very good to me."
"Find out what he wants."
"Someone has to make the first move."
"It started like that indeed."
"What would you like to do?"
"I have to go, I'll call you back."
"He wanted him to get out of it."
"I'm proud of you, my friend."
"You look great, honey."
"Are you in the infirmary this week?"
"I thought he was your friend."
"This thought crossed my mind."
"Of course, what is it?"
"Can't you see I'm working?"
"I want to see what it is."
"It's a bet like any other."
"That's where you have to go."
"But we have one thing in common."
"This is what I like to do."
"I just thought of something else."
"Dad, what is it?"
"I'll be here in half an hour."
"Where are my mother and father?"
"You know what you're getting into."
"I swear it's the truth."
"What does he want to prove?"
"Whatever comes to mind."
"I'm delighted to finally meet you."
"I invited you to do it."
"She always brings it back."
"They have everything they need."
"He looks more and more like you."
"This is the tenth course correction."
"I had a very good day."
"How happy I am to see you."
"She chews, she chews all the time."
"They believe you, you're super cool."
"That's where I belong."
"But it was self-defense."
"You take your desires for reality."
"On top of the black building, on the corner."
"She was like a sister to me."
"Show that you have a pair."
"No, that's what I thought."
"I know it and you know it."
"I was told you were leaving."
"I love you and you love me."
"That's what people want."
"No, it was someone else."
"I was wondering what was going on."
"What you're doing is good."
"He knew everything from A to Z."
"There is a reason for everything."
"I threw it out the window."
"The Doug we're looking for is white."
"I had my whole life ahead of me."
"I'm going to change your mind."
"She only served me three times."
"No one else can do it."
"Sorry you came for nothing."
"We think he's going to come home now."
"It's really good to see you."
"I swore I wouldn't say anything."
"Do you want me to call the cops?"
"I'm leaving for a while."
"I probably work in shipping."
"Who could have done this since yesterday?"
"It's just above us."
"They are doing it."
"There must be hundreds of them."
"How many times did you let it ring?"
"What is the reason for your visit?"
"She didn't say her name."
"What does he want from her?"
"I should be the one doing it."
"She told me to do it."
"I'll come as fast as I can."
"Because you're not."
"I did everything right."
"What do you want to happen?"
"I have ants in my legs."
"I need you to love me."
"Are you sure it was her?"
"Everyone loves everyone."
"It was the beginning of the end."
"What, what do you want?"
"There's a storm coming."
"What's going on, baby?"
"Do you want to go to my place?"
"Do you think that's the case?"
"I'll go with you on this one."
"I have some money for you."
"A man destined for great things."
"Take you there, and leave you there."
"Percy, reach out and be kind."
"Come give us a hand."
"How do you want me to calm down?"
"What did you tell him about me?"
"Does that mean what I think it means?"
"She is my son's mother."
"I thought you'd never arrive."
"And you know it's true."
"You know she's my wife?"
"I thought you should know."
"Negroes should have their own chair."
"First, promise me you'll stay calm."
"Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself."
"No, I'm not sure."
"Your father would be very proud of you."
"You're coming home later and later."
"What happened to the child?"
"What are we wondering?"
"Hi, what's going on?"
"Don't forget who you're talking to."
"If you find some money, we'll share it."
"This is what I wanted to show you."
"I did something for you."
"I'll introduce everyone to you."
"I always do what I say."
"I never wanted any of this."
"Look at what you give for them."
"You're going to have to find better than that."
"This is a big day for you."
"I thought you wouldn't come anymore."
"I'll see you in half an hour."
"Do you have a hat or scarf?"
"What do you say to him?"
"She has indeed flown away."
"She wasn't on the plane."
"Do you want to go together?"
"It's my life, not yours."
"I will do as you said."
"How long will it take me?"
"Did Marks close the front door?"
"That's what children do."
"That's where the money is."
"What's so funny?"
"I think we're all going."
"She is the woman of my life."
"Are you Bobby Caldwell's son?"
"To my right, above the cafe."
"Don't you want to go with me?"
"What have you done with my wife?"
"It is a great honor for me."
"This is where it gets tricky."
"He wants me to go away."
"I got what I deserved."
"You always give me good advice."
"He was the one who found us."
"They all think I'm her."
"What should I look at?"
"Is that what you wanted to know?"
"They'll extract it before dawn."
"What did you make?"
"To both."
"I know what he needs."
"This is exactly what we were looking for."
"Or rather what's left of it."
"Justice wants to take all of this from us."
"I just ask you to think about it."
"I went downstairs and you were gone."
"You can't think like that."
"We mostly have this kind of flash."
"You're taller than I thought."
"This is what partners do."
"It's between you and your father."
"Han, my boy, you are the best."
"That's what they do here."
"That was centuries ago."
"What's the name of this place?"
"You know what I'm talking about, right?"
"I almost got shot."
"Sorry to have brought you into this."
"It's someone from the inside."
"I want to do what I want."
"It wasn't about that."
"And they wanted it every month."
"It was the middle of the night."
"Because you need me."
"I also have an announcement to make."
"But we must move forward."
"There can only be one left."
"Because I asked you to."
"I will give you an unforgettable time."
"I have a pretty good idea."
"By the way, send a bottle of champagne."
"We see what we want to see."
"The dining room window?"
"I'm very pleased to meet you."
"You think about her all the time."
"What is the meaning of life?"
"That's why it pays."
"I'm ready to do anything for you."
"I didn't dare ask you."
"Legends from elsewhere and stories for children."
"Perhaps I expressed myself badly."
"You must have heard of me."
"I thought you forgot about me."
"I know what I want to do."
"Don't you have something to do?"
"We take care of each other."
"Just lend me the Ring."
"That's what friends do."
"I really like what you do."
"I will have to remember that."
"She was the mother of my child."
"I want to see you in my office."
"How do they know we're together?"
"Whatever happens, don't go out."
"I just want everything to be perfect."
"It's great that you're here."
"It was a century ago."
"I will always be there to protect you."
"Nothing will change my mind."
"It's up to him to do it."
"Until I see you."
"What if I'm not?"
"Everyone knows everyone."
"I think that's his name."
"I'll see you after the weekend."
"But I only trust him."
"I tell everyone."
"Are you thinking of someone in particular?"
"When it's personal, they have to hang up."
"Maybe he doesn't know."
"Almost two weeks ago."
"I was sure it was you."
"Maybe it was the first time."
"There must be another entrance."
"Do you want the wing or the leg?"
"Do you recognize any of these men?"
"Have you ever done boxing?"
"Another glass, please."
"Are we allowed to be here?"
"Let's ask her what she wants to do."
"She's not here either."
"I'll explain when we see each other."
"She had nowhere to go."
"This is the most likely location."
"I'll tell you the truth, darling."
"I thought you might want it."
"The answer to your question is yes."
"You've gained a little weight."
"It was you I called."
"There is still hope for you."
"The question does not even arise."
"Who's tough?"
"He takes the last flight to Miami."
"Do you think we can do it?"
"We have to prevent that, right?"
"No, it must be towards the end."
"And I wanted you to know that."
"I'm glad it's you."
"It's society that wants it."
"It'll take us half an hour."
"It's from all of us."
"It slipped my mind."
"I'll give you a little advice."
"First, I just had to get out of there."
"And that's you saying that?"
"Dominic said it was good."
"What had he done?"
"You look very fit."
"I hope I don't see you here again."
"I've always taken care of you."
"Two men outside, one at the entrance."
"This is hospital policy."
"Did she put you in this?"
"I tried to get him released."
"I have a busy schedule."
"This is my husband's car."
"I hope it doesn't come to that."
"Do you want to see my ID card?"
"That's what you imagine."
"Because it's not his eyes."
"Is it like this every night?"
"How many times do you have to tell yourself?"
"So what's going on here?"
"Do you know who this guy is?"
"I have something to say too."
"I don't want to think about that."
"You can have me wherever you want."
"Where are we with our accommodation?"
"I just want us to be together."
"Did you see or hear anything?"
"I'm the one who's going to get you."
"I've had enough of you two."
"It enhances the images they receive."
"I have a bullet in my stomach."
"I want to hear what he says."
"And I know you love me."
"But at least there are some."
"This is where I need to be."
"I had my breasts done."
"No, she didn't do that."
"What do you want me to tell them?"
"Southerners are welcome here."
"Since when do you give me orders?"
"Please do something."
"I heard this on the radio."
"I hope you have fun."
"What happened to the money?"
"I have never been so proud."
"You know what's at stake."
"It's my wife's birthday."
"What could we do?"
"I see what happened."
"How are things going on your end?"
"My camp now is me."
"Whatever the price to pay."
"I have often asked myself this question."
"I thought we told each other everything."
"But don't kid yourself."
"It's worth a try, right?"
"Each piece is unique, as is the fiber."
"This guy is a closed case."
"We found this in his pocket."
"So what will happen?"
"My father didn't agree."
"A little outside the city."
"It's him, I'm sure of it."
"And I have a gift for you."
"It was a gift from my mother."
"Is it me who has to be zen?"
"You talk about it like a game."
"What if I don't want it?"
"I need to take stock."
"But you didn't go."
"We had a good time together."
"I want to know how you feel."
"What did she see?"
"Was it a male or female voice?"
"Can't you stay a little longer?"
"Oh, it's good to see you."
"I'll get him some water."
"I look forward to hearing your story."
"Do you really believe what you say?"
"We met on the plane."
"I left them in the car."
"First time I've heard of it."
"You promised you wouldn't say anything."
"Thanks for keeping me updated."
"You can't just stand there."
"I kept my end of the bargain."
"Please show her in."
"I take what I'm given."
"An unidentified individual at the window."
"It's just marked in the files."
"I did it for years."
"Let me make a call."
"Others must find their own way."
"Our source at the bank called."
"I know what she said."
"I'm twice your age."
"I'm taking the last flight to Miami."
"The penultimate shot, there were four of us."
"It's interesting to read your reactions."
"It happened a long time ago."
"I'll see you on the other side."
"It just occurred to me."
"They do pattern recognition."
"You should have gone to the doctor."
"It took longer than expected."
"And you know I love you."
"It's a small price to pay."
"I have things to do here."
"Put your arm around my neck."
"But there is another way."
"You sure seem like it."
"So we will have little time together."
"How do you want me to do that?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming."
"Is this someone you know?"
"I thought we were on the same side."
"He was always kind to me."
"Do you know what they're going to do?"
"No, there is nothing here."
"That's what fathers do."
"I want to make things clear."
"You see, you're a born runner."
"Is this what you're going to wear?"
"That's what adults do."
"Do you have any change on you?"
"We see what that resulted in."
"That's exactly what you are."
"They are right above us."
"Gotham needs its real hero."
"Don't apologize to me."
"Mulder, what are you doing?"
"I can take care of it myself."
"It was your mother's idea."
"What would that mean?"
"Hey, you got up early."
"Tell me what I need to know."
"You stepped on my foot."
"A casino boss is shot dead."
"Have you spoken to the police about this?"
"Yes, I think it will be fine."
"I'll call you one of these days."
"Is that what you're asking me?"
"Are you sure you want to go?"
"What does he want from us?"
"That's all she has."
"Are you making decisions for him?"
"What a beautiful day, isn't it?"
"I won a module in the game."
"Those in favor, raise your hands."
"I'll get you another one."
"This is how I feel now."
"How do you know what to do?"
"I think I saw it."
"Please watch over him."
"I took you for a friend."
"There's water there."
"A guy across the street, in the park."
"I want to be able to trust you."
"I need to talk to him about it."
"Do with me what you will."
"All of that was just me."
"I thought it was the woman."
"We'll deal with them later."
"If you know something, say it."
"If you know something, please tell us."
"Because I'm proud of you."
"I think that's where it comes from."
"Where is the body supposed to be?"
"It's story time."
"No more than I love mine."
"Is that what you saw?"
"I thought he was a friend."
"Is this your way of getting revenge?"
"Give him a chance to recover."
"It's time for his lesson."
"Nor that we are old friends."
"There is nothing good."
"I thought you were in Rome."
"He's on his way to the hospital."
"Do you think we have a choice?"
"This is the other side of the coin."
"It's going to be a breeze."
"You should have thought of this sooner."
"They will know that I was with you."
"Was there anyone with you?"
"What is it, my little one?"
"She is the mother of my child."
"Do you think I'm making this all up?"
"Did you forget to buy the newspaper?"
"It takes time to discover it."
"Thus began my policy of conquest."
"I did this for your own good."
"I thought 'Gretchen Ross' was pretty cool."
"I need to take some liquid."
"Remember to bring two handbags."
"The one that will be my birthday present."
"No, they can't say it yet."
"I don't ask myself that question anymore."
"I saw them under the bridge."
"Once he came back, he played small."
"I'm glad you stopped by."
"I thought we got along well."
"Team three takes care of the fish."
"I think they were kidnapped."
"But what does this mean?"
"Can I ask you a theoretical question?"
"And now he's gone."
"No, I don't remember anything."
"It looks like they're leaving."
"There are more and more of them."
"I will be sure to tell him."
"I have never seen the sea."
"Have you given up?"
"What do they mean?"
"Did you hear a gunshot?"
"But Colonel is also an order."
"I saw you at the funeral."
"We need to move up a gear."
"The Comedian was a bit of both."
"Yeah, I think you're right."
"She takes it to her plastic surgeon."
"If that's what he wants."
"Do you know where I could find it?"
"They took him to the hospital."
"That's our daughter's name."
"Because she asked me to."
"That's what you know how to do."
"I don't know, what do you think?"
"I can't even think about it."
"Sounds like a superhero name."
"She shows my card all the time."
"I just spoke to the police."
"I found this in his room."
"Just answer yes or no."
"What is the purpose of photography?"
"I said not to move."
"We greet each other when we pass each other."
"This is the hospital's rule."
"I would get a B or a B-."
"I can do this all night."
"She waves her paws to turn around."
"I thought it was a legend."
"You know what I wonder?"
"I appreciate your cooperation."
"It is a revolution of the mind."
"They are still fighting over their suitcases."
"The lover said something."
"But I know he's there."
"I'll see what we have."
"I was the one who pushed him."
"You know, the guy who writes to me?"
"There are rules to follow."
"No, this is not a test."
"It's time for my walk."
"It's meeting time."
"There are only women."
"I have some paperwork to do."
"No, she didn't tell me anything."
"I'm on the corner."
"It's good to have you here."
"He is a good friend of mine."
"Someone left the door open."
"No, one year of celebration is enough."
"Hey does it come with the crate?"
"I never asked myself the question."
"I used to come often when we were in a team."
"How does he know so much about me?"
"Katie's killers, evidence in hand."
"I have news on the Phantom."
"My husband brought it back from Japan."
"It belongs to us and we want it."
"I wondered where he had gone."
"How long have we been here?"
"Say what you don't say."
"Uh, what is it?"
"They will come and eat out of your hand."
"And I have a family to support."
"I think it's a girl."
"All of Europe will hear about this."
"Place an 'X' in the appropriate place."
"What are you going to do with all this?"
"What did you do to my daughter?"
"No, I'm the one who apologizes."
"At least I had that chance."
"It will be convenient to find your way around."
"No, she didn't say it."
"Do I have something between my teeth?"
"They'll get our skin for this thing."
"You must hear us all the time."
"You look good, Adrian."
"I have other errands to run."
"I have so many questions to ask."
"Come see the rest of the family."
"I like things as they are."
"Where is Mrs. Chan going at this time?"
"I forgot you were here."
"I think you look good together."
"They are looking for beer."
"You just have to tell me."
"He may have seen something."
"I have a sense of humor."
"You see what I meant?"
"We'll do it your way."
"I was given a second chance."
"We'll see if you like it."
"I will be forever grateful to him."
"You have made great profits from it."
"I think I can fix this."
"It's in my purse."
"No, I'm too old for that."
"I need your full attention."
"She's fine where she is."
"Nothing like a good beer."
"We'll live longer, in any case."
"What's your last name?"
"This is the strength of the human heart."
"It is a pleasure to welcome you."
"I'll make Eve and Diane wait."
"I'm going to go in and eliminate the target."
"I love her and she loves me."
"How could you hide it from me?"
"Everyone is at their posts."
"You must take me for someone else."
"He'll never expect that."
"I know it matters to you."
"What else did you tell him?"
"Do you think they saw us?"
"Everyone is laughing at you."
"Until it's ready."
"I already have a team there."
"I have a wife and a child."
"We've done some big things together."
"No, there's more to it than that."
"I just need a moment."
"I'm going to need a minute."
"I flipped a coin."
"Let us be silent and swift as shadows."
"You know I can do it."
"And there will be others."
"No, I didn't think about that."
"But what are you looking for?"
"I came of my own free will."
"My plan ended with the Jeep."
"What do doctors say about the head?"
"Well, that's a good thing."
"She's awesome, isn't she?"
"That's well said, Mr. Hammer."
"He absolutely has to be ready."
"This time you came as a master."
"It's mainly to get some fresh air."
"It's my word against yours."
"And it's because of me."
"I have a business meeting."
"It's your wedding day."
"I don't remember them."
"With Tony it's always a party."
"I could always count on you."
"I kicked him out."
"Think about what we could do."
"I think I can't."
"I'd better do it."
"I recognize the sounds of the street."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please."
"Thank you for inviting me to dinner."
"He makes more puns."
"What are you still doing?"
"He knew Nicky had a microphone."
"Everything is fine, you are safe."
"But you know who did it."
"This is what we needed."
"Mom, I need to talk to you."
"I want you to look at the screen."
"That's what I do, right?"
"At his house, I found clues."
"Yes, Dad, you told us."
"No, I haven't decided yet."
"She gives me goosebumps."
"I give you what you want."
"Since the other night, I mean?"
"That's what my father says."
"Sorry to have to break it to you."
"The magician shows you an ordinary thing."
"I had never seen her before."
"Here or there, same thing."
"Sorry about what happened."
"I wonder what they are talking about."
"But I've never been there."
"I'm sorry about that."
"I hope that doesn't happen."
"The richest man in the world."
"The Ring of Power within my grasp."
"You don't know anything?"
"What happened to your parents?"
"Who can no longer access the system?"
"I weigh more than all of you put together."
"If there is a next time."
"A spear coming out of the chest."
"I'm going to make myself comfortable."
"Look what she did to herself."
"I'm glad you're happy."
"And you know I'm right."
"And what does he feel for her?"
"Is that what scares you?"
"You think about it and call me?"
"I can call you whenever I want."
"I think about her every day."
"Can't we go to your house?"
"I want you to get out of here."
"And you have that in your chest?"
"I'm glad to see you here."
"You and I have a lot in common."
"I decide, not you."
"I just wanted to wish you good luck."
"Did she have an argument with a customer?"
"I came to bring you a check."
"This is my brother's car."
"On the other side of the square."
"Where is the rest of the money?"
"We all have something to hide."
"I said stay in the car."
"Look what he gave me."
"I'm talking about your family, Donnie."
"She was the one who called me."
"I really appreciate what you do."
"Thank you for coming to my rescue."
"Can I say whatever I want?"
"No, what are you talking about?"
"I think I have one."
"They put it in a bag."
"I already have something planned."
"With everything we've done?"
"You are a triple agent in fact."
"What does she want from him?"
"I'll wake you up when they're done."
"I was with you in the meadow."
"There is milk in the fridge."
"We did well to come here."
"This is my mother's car."
"Just do what I tell you."
"We went around the world."
"Don't you believe in your people?"
"Of course I can see you."
"This is what is written here."
"It's time for your medication."
"She's right, the party is over."
"For them, he was the star."
"I never got a response."
"I realized something."
"Glad to see you're doing well."
"I put her away."
"You're the only one who knows."
"They needed a man they could trust."
"A hot dog, please."
"They should be leaving soon."
"I'll take you back to your father."
"A new stage of your journey begins."
"But I've never seen him."
"I'll sign anything you want."
"Should I tell you about your father?"
"A miracle has just happened."
"I've always been lucky."
"You better come with me."
"I can't go now."
"Kids, we're going to the hotel."
"I wanted to talk to you about it first."
"Why do I have to explain things to you?"
"Actually, there are two."
"It looks like she knew the shooter."
"Am I going to pay for this all my life?"
"It's because of money."
"I have a lot of love to give."
"You pinched a certain Ray Harris."
"The book describes their movements, their smell."
"And that goes for everyone."
"What was the nature of your relationship?"
"From the bottom of my heart, I greet you."
"I think it's my turn."
"It's almost dinner time."
"I'll send you a piece of soap."
"I have big plans for you."
"Look what they did to him."
"I'm tired of this place."
"What memories do you have of your father?"
"I'm all she has."
"Guys, look what I got."
"So we can't prevent this?"
"What if they don't make it?"
"I saw him the other day."
"Please come to the point."
"I have a good one for you."
"They are mine, I take them."
"They blamed everything on him."
"You didn't change the locks?"
"It's good to see you smile."
"Once again, please."
"It would be great if it were you."
"His bullets go over the fence."
"Now the Ring has brought him here."
"You need to rebuild your schedule."
"I just need a few days."
"I want to do something for you."
"It feels like Christmas morning."
"It's like we're brothers."
"Was there anyone with him?"
"You are the only one who knows."
"And I did it for you."
"Where is he holding her?"
"Are you in on it, or not?"
"Only what can happen happens."
"That would be something to ask Mr. Rand."
"What about the other one?"
"It's even better in the dark."
"It took me a while to understand."
"I just need it."
"That's it, laugh at me."
"There are ten years of waiting."
"Don't you want a normal life?"
"They will return for the quarter-finals."
"No one respects the forest anymore."
"I needed the tax deduction."
"Okay, here's what we're going to do."
"Nothing is more important than that."
"Ivan, what is it?"
"I learned how to use it."
"His power is growing, isn't it?"
"But what are you?"
"I remember giving it to him."
"Raise your arms, please."
"I had to become something else."
"Every living thing follows an established path."
"This is your captain speaking."
"How long has it been there?"
"This is my father's office."
"You were like a son to me."
"What's left for us to eat?"
"She is a very impressive young person."
"What's good about it?"
"It does, however, justify questioning him."
"That's what matters most."
"Yes, that's a very good idea."
"I give him a hand."
"Do you realize how lucky you are?"
"I never asked you that."
"The rescue team is on its way."
"You looked after me so well."
"The one who gave you this jewel."
"What the hell are you doing, Tyler?"
"I told him to go."
"I'll try to find something."
"I hope it still fits me."
"Look what I did to you."
"I have to tell you, for the future."
"You wanted to undress me and kiss me."
"Tell me who did this to you."
"He is one of my best friends."
"People make all kinds of plans."
"Do I have to tell you again?"
"It's just flesh."
"This is the end of the road."
"Less than a day ahead of us."
"Do you have money for your milk?"
"I want you to close your eyes."
"I have a wife waiting for me."
"I love you and you know it."
"How do you know if you're telling the truth?"
"Just tell me what you want."
"What would you have done in my place?"
"Is that all you came for?"
"And you think it's me?"
"Do you believe in time travel?"
"I'll join you as soon as I can."
"I said what I knew."
"I wonder how this happened."
"You will, won't you?"
"You should take a look."
"What gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?"
"I've done a little bit of everything."
"You have white and pink."
"It's a mix of martial arts."
"It makes us a lot of money."
"How old is Grandma Death?"
"It's time for my nap."
"Janey Slater, Manhattan's ex-girlfriend."
"I want to talk to you about Ray Harris."
"Your little games no longer amuse them."
"I'll give you another chance."
"I'll get the first aid kit."
"Not yet, anyway."
"I will never come to the dark side."
"Gotham needs a real hero."
"Do you know who you are dealing with?"
"You have to give the order."
"I'll give them back to you next month."
"She wasn't there this morning."
"Go ahead, lift it up, make a little effort."
"Doctor says the treatment is simple."
"You are the best dad in the world."
"Do I have a brother?"
"You are a truly exciting person."
"That's what he means."
"What is it, big guy?"
"There was water everywhere."
"I promise you it will be okay."
"It's hunting season."
"He was the best of us."
"What did you want for that Christmas?"
"He does this to everyone."
"How many months are you?"
"We can talk now, if you want."
"Thank you for participating in our exercise."
"She will never be the same again."
"You must answer when I speak to you."
"Is this what you want to be?"
"The cop car is cool."
"That way we were able to talk to each other."
"I also have a gift for you."
"What was that car thing about?"
"Does everyone know what they have to do?"
"I'm replacing someone for the evening."
"All this means nothing."
"What makes you happy?"
"Do you see what you're doing to him?"
"I'm glad to see you too."
"You know what I forgot?"
"Our mission is to deliver justice."
"What are you doing, Mom?"
"And you, how are you doing?"
"I designed it."
"We'll squeeze them into the car."
"You're Sally Jupiter's daughter."
"When are we getting married?"
"This may be the best solution."
"What is it, my angel?"
"She's not safe here."
"That, my friend, is a pint."
"Do I matter so little?"
"Just a moment, please."
"I stuck her in a door."
"The finish line is in sight."
"What do you think of your mother now?"
"It's because we love you."
"Haven't you been told anything yet?"
"I need stitches."
"What happened to your glasses?"
"You think I haven't tried?"
"It's good to feel useful."
"I'm talking to you about school, Donnie."
"If you want to call it that."
"We'll meet back here in an hour."
"I need to eat something."
"What's for dessert?"
"I don't need this anymore."
"I want you to take my place."
"It was you I came to see."
"There are divers in the park."
"I think we'll find out."
"You don't have long left."
"Did you see how he looked at me?"
"Don't you want to go get some ice cream?"
"I forgot my toothbrush."
"Just like your audience with the Senate."
"I will give them to him when he returns."
"It's late, I have to go."
"Are you ready to party?"
"You know I love you very much."
"I'll show you how it works."
"Everyone who spreads the word."
"There must be another one."
"There are two kinds of people."
"And the beatings she received?"
"You have just created a new item."
"Are you discovering a bit of humanity in yourself?"
"In the interest of science, let's say."
"You know how much I love my family."
"The Force is strong in your family."
"There must be another access."
"Because it's important to me."
"Do you have any pictures to give me?"
"You can keep it if you want."
"Do you know what happened to me?"
"I hid it in my trunk."
"Are you sure he's here?"
"Marriage is good, isn't it?"
"There might be some mail."
"Forgive me for doubting you."
"Is there hope?"
"That's how I like it."
"I have a big surprise for you."
"Love is a battlefield."
"I have the beginning of a story."
"You'll tell me if it worked."
"Your son gave us shelter."
"What do you do then?"
"I woke up, he was there."
"It's the only one I know."
"What are you two talking about?"
"Buffy is like no one else."
"I want to be part of your life."
"There's an app for that."
"I like it when you talk like that."
"They blamed everything on me."
"I'll see where he is."
"Do you want me to call a taxi?"
"I'll pick her up from work."
"Does this suit both of you?"
"Do you have something to ask me?"
"Did you get your hair cut?"
"What if she misses church too?"
"You don't look like him at all."
"Thank God you are safe and sound."
"He has something to tell you."
"Ah Ping wrote to me from Singapore."
"You're flying to L.A."
"This is what he told me."
"I swear, I don't know."
"Thank you both for coming."
"Where do I come from?"
"Are you offering me a bribe?"
"I think you should apologize."
"No one else has access to it."
"But a lot of things have changed."
"We have time for that one."
"You need to take shelter."
"I have a stable relationship or almost."
"I hope I'm not interrupting anything."
"I'll start with a little massage."
"I have big plans for him."
"I'm telling you, that's all."
"What is happiness for you?"
"He protects us, he protects people."
"But it proves that the system works."
"It was several months ago."
"For once, I agree."
"I think he's looking for the queen."
"Can we know what you are doing?"
"Is it stimulating enough?"
"She was the strongest of the trio."
"This is where you come from."
"Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
"I'll never be good at baseball."
"I have a good plan for you."
"No, but it's a good idea."
"She has no business being there."
"We'll bring you back to life."
"If you think it's better."
"I like your haircut."
"And the boy will return to his forest."
"How long will I stay here?"
"They leave, and you let them."
"We will see the flames from very far away."
"That's what matters to me."
"I promise I will pay you back."
"We'll draw straws."
"We stay and do it."
"Because you don't want to."
"He's the sheriff's brother-in-law."
"Han will cut the energy field."
"I love you both so much."
"It's not just us."
"But you can't go there."
"Ah, you need some new clothes."
"What do you want to do in life?"
"I did what was right."
"It's good to have a fan."
"You're throwing your life away."
"I have to go back to the street."
"The girl I told you about."
"I have absolute confidence in him."
"Did you say 'please'?"
"Do you think you could do that?"
"As if I were going to tell you."
"Maybe we'll see each other again one day."
"Wait here, I'll be right back."
"He speaks French and German."
"How about a nightcap?"
"I have to talk to my husband about this."
"I want to be sure I understand."
"So, do you like the bird?"
"Open the trunk, please."
"The cabin door is open and locked."
"It's flu season."
"You know what I found?"
"You think I wanted this?"
"I do everything out of love for you."
"I think you should talk to him."
"Let me judge for myself."
"Where can I go?"
"What if there was someone?"
"I didn't do anything else."
"What comes out of the ground?"
"I think we've waited long enough."
"I did it last week."
"Of course I want one."
"What else can you tell me?"
"Let's show them what we can do."
"Do you see what I have to go through?"
"How could I not see anything?"
"You can ask anyone."
"She doesn't answer her phone."
"What happened to you, my boy?"
"You know very well that I love you."
"He came out of it cleansed of everything."
"I've read about it."
"That's what it seemed."
"He wants to know what's going on."
"Do you want a bullet in the head?"
"He will know what that means."
"Have I not been clear enough?"
"I've dreamed about it all my life."
"I have some personal matters to attend to."
"Don't you wish me luck?"
"She needs to be taken to the hospital."
"I have to tell my mother."
"If you're reading this, you're out."
"I don't know, it's possible."
"I think I can handle this."
"Okay. I'll be right there."
"I met him on the train."
"Is this supposed to make me feel better?"
"It's been like this for years."
"That's what I'm for."
"I heard you on the radio."
"Do you know what we're doing here?"
"What does he say about it?"
"I made you."
"Do you know what I realized?"
"Your family is united, I feel it."
"The perfect marriage between technology and management."
"What if we don't find it?"
"Not mine or the director's."
"Please, this is important."
"And even if it was?"
"I really want to see you."
"Inspector Ho, please."
"What do you want me to know about it?"
"They are exterminating us."
"I never had a daughter."
"Do you tell him or do I do it?"
"There must be some somewhere."
"We'll have to catch up on our fishing trips."
"You are your father's daughter."
"I should have told you about us."
"We do it in front of the United Nations."
"Would you like this to become a movie?"
"I thought we had that sorted."
"Tell the Registers to get lost."
"You never talked about her."
"It's nice of you to think of it."
"Three beers for each of my colleagues."
"He's a really good person."
"I am an FBI special agent."
"I did pretty well."
"They already know we're here."
"No, I didn't find it."
"Didn't anyone notice?"
"If that's how you feel."
"Let's go see your aunt's apartment."
"There is only one possibility."
"It's better that you don't know anything."
"You want it to end like this?"
"I think we're onto something."
"This is the first thing to do."
"After all, tomorrow is another day."
"Do you want us to call someone?"
"There is no camera."
"Nothing good will come of it."
"Power beyond your dreams."
"Tell the driver to take my luggage away."
"Did I tell you to do it?"
"Who knows what that means?"
"Oh, she's my friend Caroline."
"It depends on how you look at it."
"I saw how you looked at each other."
"But Nicky and his gang had slipped up."
"You need the password."
"I thought it was mine."
"But you have to tell me the truth."
"I'm not what you think."
"I look forward to completing your training."
"FBI We have a warrant."
"Maybe there is someone."
"Let's tune in to the highest energy."
"Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?"
"What if she's not there?"
"All born one year apart."
"What happened to my apartment?"
"There is a man downstairs."
"No, I'm not very hungry."
"How many times do I have to apologize?"
"Thank you for opening my eyes."
"Because it's rare, you understand?"
"If it is God's will."
"I know you have things to do."
"Place your bets, please."
"I put it in a barrel."
"It's just a small gift."
"There must be other options."
"You should have said that earlier."
"I want you to come home with me."
"A rebel who gives himself up to us."
"We'll find them, you and I."
"I need a fresh start."
"I'll deal with him later."
"You can stay here if you want."
"I can make phone calls."
"So what have we gotten ourselves into?"
"I thought we were a team."
"I thought it was for me."
"What do you want, Dad?"
"It should be the same in life."
"We wish you a very happy birthday."
"He's trying to tell you something."
"I want you to take the Falcon."
"I guess that's the case."
"I'm going to go get myself a beer."
"I know what you're all thinking."
"This is what brings me here."
"I don't know that word."
"No stopover in the red zone."
"This is my father's funeral."
"For what I did to you."
"I don't ask myself the question."
"I told them where we were."
"And then there is something else."
"I wrote something for you."
"It's never been so good."
"You are the last of this line."
"Yes, you already told me that."
"Have you seen my report card?"
"Roy, what are you doing?"
"Have your cake and eat it too."
"Do you have any advice for me?"
"No woman is worth it."
"I'm glad we understand each other."
"The same as your father's."
"No, I'm not aware of that."
"I'm going to put out a wanted poster."
"I was a friend of your father."
"We all put something into it."
"Is she safe?"
"I did it last time."
"Do you think it's the food?"
"Sorry I wasn't there."
"Please don't hang up."
"It's day and night."
"It's about your son."
"Trust me, please."
"Something else happened."
"I am exactly where I want to be."
"And how do you intend to go about it?"
"That's what we always do."
"I could see it in his eyes."
"I need a heating engineer."
"Do you think this will last long?"
"So, shall we go around, guys?"
"They only talk about you."
"But you should have been faster."
"Do you care about me?"
"What are you looking for here?"
"Wait, what is this?"
"It's tap water."
"How many times should I say it?"
"Yes, what can I do for you?"
"You'd better check in my office."
"I'm glad to have met you."
"I'll be back in three days."
"I've never been asked."
"He has lifted the spirits of many."
"I'm bringing back Mr. Chow's books."
"I love spending time with you."
"I have one last thing to do."
"It's always about money."
"Who else is in on this?"
"Of course you want things."
"Oh, I forgot to tell you."
"I hope one day you will understand."
"Yes, I even thought about writing one."
"I told you to hurry."
"He has the right to be there."
"She's not on the list."
"They shot him in the back."
"Do you want me to come back later?"
"Mom, where are we?"
"Maybe he won't come back."
"I said that."
"Ms. Chan, are you going out to buy noodles?"
"You know what I heard?"
"The events in Monaco have proven this."
"Vegas was a dream come true for me."
"I am from the Music Hall union."
"Say something to Mom for me."
"This story is inspired by true events."
"It was my mother's house."
"What did you do to my baby?"
"You're no better than me."
"I took him to the hospital."
"There may be microphones."
"Nobody talks to me like that."
"I've loved you since day one."
"Who came up with the idea for the calendar?"
"You say that to all the girls."
"What happened to your lip?"
"I received a phone call."
"She was impounded."
"Well, what do I do?"
"It's because I'm here."
"And I have to thank you for that."
"And what do you believe?"
"It's about you and me."
"He taught me a lot of things."
"Where did you get Oklahoma-Michigan from?"
"Here is the warrant for the detainee's arrest."
"I know his name, I know him?"
"I need another service."
"I thought it was important."
"Are you on your period right now?"
"Oh yeah, I've heard about it."
"And I will always be there for you."
"You can believe whatever you want."
"You're not a little boy anymore."
"Is this the reason for your visit?"
"Does the Senator yield the floor?"
"I told you to go."
"Mom said it."
"I only need you."
"She didn't want to say it."
"I need to know what you know."
"I'd better go talk to him."
"Check with the FBI to see if he's on file."
"The last one standing is the winner."
"You seem to be doing fine."
"Jon must see the world like that."
"What happened to my men?"
"This is my mother's room."
"You've been locked up here for two days."
"I don't even dare to think about it."
"No, there were others."
"You're the one who doesn't understand anything."
"They are practically out of the game."
"I had a vision of you."
"You will see a jump in a puddle,.."
"I don't know her either."
"It's just love."
"And that's what you want?"
"It took a little while."
"I'm sure it's good."
"Would you do anything for me?"
"What will you do when you grow up?"
"It's a real gold mine."
"I thought you wanted to leave her?"
"I'm sure you'll make it."
"They are getting younger and younger."
"No, but I know where he is."
"I called her ex-wife."
"This return is surprising on his part."
"What did you decide?"
"For a pack of cigarettes per head."
"A lot of things can happen."
"Sign here for your valuables."
"That's what I had to say."
"Did you see what it was?"
"Tell me what she did."
"That's what my mother says."
"This is how I love Helen."
"I'll keep you safe."
"I see you're serving drinks."
"I used to play it when I was little."
"I had put him on the spot."
"The number of hotel employees."
"It's time to choose sides."
"Mindy wanted two girls and a boy."
"Wouldn't he be safe here?"
"I'm sure you'll like it."
"An iced tea, please."
"Thank you for telling me your secret."
"This is exactly what I expect."
"Have you seen me on TV?"
"Looks like the post office is still working."
"What does that mean to you?"
"She gave her life for me."
"I only have half an hour."
"He had a fight with his wife."
"See you later, my love."
"Who can shed some light on these inscriptions?"
"Your mother's maiden name?"
"I'll see what he's doing."
"Being locked up and finally accepting it."
"I can see how you look at me."
"What happened in the meantime?"
"Go see elsewhere if I'm there."
"What about this one?"
"I'm glad I found you."
"Can I see some ID?"
"I needed time to think."
"It was time we met."
"And what will you do?"
"Yes, I was lucky."
"I feel it deep inside me."
"You look very sexy tonight, baby."
"With a brother from another marriage."
"You didn't want me to come?"
"I wish everything was different."
"Do you think we can do this?"
"I'll give you an 'old buddy' discount."
"He would be about your age."
"But what does he say?"
"No, I have nothing to do with it."
"The study of pressures and time."
"This is the job of the police."
"You saw what happened."
"But you have to promise me one thing."
"Can't you make an exception?"
"I thought it was better."
"You said some pretty brilliant things."
"I just want to ask you a question."
"Isn't that what we wanted?"
"This is what we all wish for."
"All you have to do is sign."
"I have always taken care of you."
"How many times have you done this?"
"I'm a bit of a magician at that."
"I took it just in case."
"There is always another way."
"No, you mean it's great."
"That gives us a little time."
"I do my job, do yours."
"The Force is strong in my family."
"We just agreed."
"What is her maiden name?"
"I forgot I had it."
"I mistook you for a cop."
"Let's see who is hiding behind the mask."
"Is this the Department of Justice?"
"He talks about you all the time."
"You have always been by my side."
"I'll come back tomorrow, first thing in the morning."
"It's like we're married."
"It's time for me to introduce myself."
"It's time for you to go to bed."
"I thought we had an arrangement."
"I found someone else."
"She said it was important."
"Well, that's a good question."
"Do you really think that's it?"
"It's a little early for that."
"I saw you through the window."
"I want you to work for me."
"Your own number, on your own door."
"Please drop your weapons."
"Your parents must be proud of you."
"I can't live with you anymore."
"Who should I call?"
"And then she played with him."
"He came to the stock this morning."
"We will do what I have decided."
"The curve of the Earth prevents this."
"I just want to, that's all."
"You better get out of here."
"This is exactly what we want."
"She's lovely, isn't she?"
"Until the end of my days."
"You know I like Jasmine."
"Promise me one thing, both of you."
"Tell him what you saw."
"What happened to this woman?"
"You'll see what it does."
"Did you stay up all night?"
"What we should have already done."
"What is it, my son?"
"I really hope you are right."
"There's plenty of it."
"I saw the face of God."
"Were you the first on the scene?"
"It was my father's first name."
"Don't you feel the same way?"
"I have a friend in the hospital."
"He may have changed his mind."
"I have a lot to say."
"Do you want to be my bridesmaid?"
"Glad to see you're feeling better."
"But he's a good person."
"You didn't ask the question."
"What are you singing to us?"
"Are you used to this job?"
"I'm going to be late for class."
"He could screw everything up."
"They better do this right."
"He has some really good ones."
"You are the woman of my life."
"You want to know what I want?"
"I have what I need here."
"I came to ask you a question."
"I need a urine sample."
"This stuff sells itself."
"This is a big moment for me."
"Especially when it comes to money."
"We are all very proud of you."
"You know what we need?"
"That's it, I remember it."
"Do you think I made it all up?"
"I thought you wouldn't come back."
"We started together, we will end together."
"I've never been anywhere."
"Do you think we'll believe you?"
"I'm going to ask you some simple questions."
"I have a little job for you."
"In Memphis, talking to you."
"Have you met someone else?"
"This is the way out."
"What don't you think?"
"It's just a memory now."
"You don't know what I'm talking about?"
"And that's what I will do."
"It's heaven that sent you."
"You have a knack for saving me."
"But there is good news."
"We'll take care of the house."
"Do you think I don't see anything?"
"I know he's your friend."
"Is it because of a girl?"
"Of course, otherwise I wouldn't ask."
"That's very mature of you."
"It must be one of those."
"To them, everything seemed fine."
"See you in half an hour."
"Still can't sleep?"
"I think I have a plan."
"I know you wanted to deactivate me."
"I hope it works out for you."
"It will be the same for you."
"His book has no story."
"No, there is another one."
"And look what happened."
"I've had long nights here."
"He must have already sent some guys."
"I know exactly what you're talking about."
"All right, I'll be right there."
"I thought you would be more enthusiastic."
"To me, he's mentally ill."
"It makes my blood run cold."
"I can and I will do it."
"I know times are tough."
"I didn't learn much."
"This is the first one I've done."
"I need some wire."
"You never told me anything."
"Who is the Spider photographer?"
"You know what I really want?"
"Until now you have been flawless."
"That's how we operate."
"That's a different story."
"Do I look like a bank?"
"Please come to Earth."
"Their number is increasing day by day."
"What happened to your tooth?"
"That's what you always do."
"The scouts will lead us to the generator."
"There is water here."
"I need a big favor."
"What are we going to see?"
"Tanaka certainly has something in mind."
"Maybe you shouldn't."
"He said it was good."
"Joey, what are you doing?"
"Do you show him that you love him?"
"What else happened?"
"What is the secret that unites them?"
"See you next weekend."
"I never had a family."
"He took me under his wing."
"You said you'd be back soon."
"You don't say anything about your gifts."
"That's what they tell me."
"You, give me a hand."
"I'm sure it will work out."
"What do you think he's going to do?"
"What do you want, Morgan?"
"I suspected you'd say that."
"Should I have sent him packing?"
"This is my dearest wish."
"The baby is kicking."
"I love walking there in the evening."
"I'll call you back as soon as I can."
"We're all on the same team."
"But thank you for thinking of me."
"What did he tell you, exactly?"
"You had an affair with her."
"If his feelings are sincere or not?"
"The L.A. police, the feds."
"It won't be much longer now."
"I do it from time to time."
"I gave him a sleeping pill."
"This is the key to the future."
"My stomach is full of Xanax."
"The same goes for you."
"There must be a rational explanation."
"In his little Russian house, all blue."
"I'm at my best."
"Do you want to tell me where we're going?"
"This is modern art."
"You could have said it sooner."
"I always wanted to be a spy."
"You don't want to come with me?"
"They had other plans for me."
"But you never did."
"What do you have planned?"
"I was never told that."
"It has to go well."
"Who says you are one?"
"You pulled your own tooth out."
"You need to talk to him, Antonio."
"It's becoming more and more common."
"It had slipped my mind."
"The report of his quest for the Grail."
"Do you listen to me when I talk to you?"
"Take your courage to the girl, Spartacus."
"Oh, the pleasure is all mine."
"But what does that change?"
"Have you seen my service record?"
"I'm not sure either."
"That's what we would like to know."
"I have a sixth sense for that."
"We do what we want with it."
"I'm the first to say it."
"I thought it was your mother."
"No Security Level worth it."
"Time is slipping through our fingers."
"For the first time in two months."
"I have to get ready for school."
"What's so different?"
"This is how it ends."
"You may have known him for a long time."
"Are you sure it's them?"
"You have other fish to fry."
"I'm married to a doctor now."
"It's just a small cut."
"Where did you get that one from?"
"Maybe the girl signed up?"
"This is far from the case."
"Stu, how much do you have in the bank?"
"It sometimes takes three days for identification."
"I think you're right, Montana."
"You did this to yourself."
"I'll pay whatever you want."
"It was several years ago."
"I say we should hire him."
"She never said anything about it."
"This is the room for serious conversations."
"I wonder what they say."
"You didn't answer the phone."
"You'll be the first to know."
"And who does this check go to?"
"That's all that matters now."
"We are all from the same family."
"I'll go get her with you, Everett."
"Is there another man?"
"I'll look for some transportation."
"Do you know what happened to you?"
"I thought it was the hunter."
"What will it do?"
"He had a wife and two children."
"Are you going to write that into your script?"
"I made you debut."
"Are you sure that's it?"
"You know I have it."
"I make and sell soap."
"That we should tell each other things."
"You can't go now."
"Thanks buddy, this is for you."
"Colin saw it in his camera."
"I fought for this country."
"The priest leads them directly to the Temple."
"I just want to tell you something."
"But he never did."
"An hour for me or for you?"
"I wish things were different."
"We are in the middle of a war."
"No, I don't like that, thank you."
"They are in a safe in Spain."
"I need another favor."
"Who do you think you're dealing with?"
"One more gram and it will be great."
"Can you take me to this address?"
"If you need me, call."
"I need them both."
"Do you like seeing other people's cards?"
"It's because of the accident."
"Come see something very beautiful."
"Where are my father's guards?"
"Are you the one giving the medal?"
"Is there a mechanic in the room?"
"With a package, a backpack?"
"I didn't ask for a lawyer."
"No, you don't have the right."
"You look like a lunatic."
"We must defend the traditions of freedom."
"Make sure they find them."
"It can mean many things."
"This seems to surprise you."
"I still have feelings for you."
"Is she the girl of your dreams?"
"I think he wants to marry me."
"That's what we tell ourselves."
"I've heard that one before."
"I saw the end of the world."
"But I will send you a nice gift."
"You want to know what I was doing?"
"Have you looked in the mirror?"
"I read about him."
"I heard you were looking for me."
"It must be someone else."
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
"You want me to call the cops?"
"This is the opportunity of a lifetime."
"Are you able to answer our questions?"
"His Grail research journal."
"That must have been quite a battle."
"And that was a long time ago."
"Inside and out."
"They say it's the best."
"Try to make the most of it."
"Who knows if he's not getting sugar?"
"Do you know what they will do to us?"
"How long has it been since you slept?"
"You can be whatever you want."
"There is something underneath."
"It could happen to anyone."
"My boss demands an expense report."
"And above all, a woman who loves you."
"There's nothing for me?"
"She doesn't agree."
"Doug, it's just a car."
"No, I'll put you on something else."
"I did my best here."
"What I want is you."
"Others do it for you."
"Where will this lead us?"
"You had found paradise in America."
"The cup that gives eternal life."
"But you have to keep an open mind."
"This is what you did to him."
"I already have what I want."
"I didn't ask you that."
"Is that all you remember?"
"I made him a hero."
"Welcome back to the world of the living."
"Nice work, isn't it?"
"I don't know, that's how it is."
"It ends with you in tears."
"That's all they do."
"I'll call you as soon as I arrive."
"So what do you do for a living?"
"How did you get into the mask?"
"I think we're done here."
"It is a law of nature."
"Where are we going to live?"
"It was a carpenter's cut."
"There are a lot of reasons."
"But you know what it is."
"What do you mean you don't know Benny Alvarez?"
"I only took one."
"Maybe you're right, you know?"
"She left because of me."
"He tells everyone."
"He took a shower this morning."
"I know exactly how she feels."
"You are your father's son."
"And the insurance will probably reimburse me."
"You'd better stay here."
"Your presence is required at the podium."
"We began to see things differently."
"I saw some on TV."
"Haven't you done enough?"
"This job was made for you."
"Before it was part of a ritual."
"You have to come see this."
"After what just happened?"
"I'm sorry, but that's how it is."
"I always wanted to start a family."
"You will live to see those days reborn."
"Is this what you wanted Tony?"
"But yes, I say goodbye to you."
"I'm done with the witness."
"The answer to what you are looking for."
"She hasn't changed at all."
"That seems to be it."
"Take everything you need."
"I'll do your hair and makeup."
"I saw it on his face."
"This man needs a doctor."
"I've lived here my whole life."
"He turned white as a sheet."
"I haven't eaten since yesterday."
"I have lived in many places."
"I spoke to you on the phone, didn't I?"
"There is a telephone over there."
"Do you really know what you're doing?"
"I have work to do tomorrow."
"So let him take you home."
"I think they're leaving."
"I can take you if you want."
"You must have had that idea in mind."
"You only care about yourself."
"Sonny was keen on my offer, right?"
"You're the one who's high, Tony."
"Thank you for coming so far."
"I'm yours, you see, Tony?"
"What is the new system?"
"I take things as they come."
"No one observed vital functions?"
"His fate turned against him."
"I made a new friend."
"You were taken for a toad."
"I think I'll give up."
"I want you to feel better."
"As if I wasn't there."
"What image does he have of himself?"
"I need to catch my breath."
"Bring your old brother a beer."
"What does he imagine?"
"But you have to be honest with me."
"To wait to be able to speak."
"It's the best in town."
"You'll be sharing Beth's dressing room."
"She's charming, isn't she?"
"Initiative comes to those who wait."
"You should cross your fingers elsewhere."
"Because I don't have any."
"How did it go there?"
"You'll see what I mean."
"What Art and Dash saw."
"This is the woman I love."
"The lead role is made for me."
"You're the one who needs it."
"The bathroom is upstairs."
"What do you give him?"
"I'll be back in a quarter of an hour."
"And what do you want to talk to him about?"
"Who said I love you?"
"That's what he meant."
"What is it, Doctor?"
"I want you to come with us."
"How long did you stay there?"
"I'll get myself another drink."
"Do you want me to say something?"
"Do you want to go to prom with me?"
"I know another children's story."
"It's like licking a battery."
"And you, are you lecturing me?"
"He said to start without him."
"You're going to give me an example."
"I met him in a bar."
"Sorry about what happened to you."
"I think we're almost there."
"You were very clear about that."
"It's the leap of faith."
"I haven't heard anything since."
"Find him and you will find the Grail."
"It still belongs to him, are you sure?"
"Call me at lunchtime."
"It's about your mother."
"Can't you sit across the table?"
"Do you think I did it?"
"I didn't know who I was anymore."
"Did he give you money?"
"But that's not true anymore."
"I want to know how it happened."
"Everyone to battle stations."
"One for the road, and you're on your way home."
"The solution presents itself."
"Are you on the soccer team?"
"I just wanted to make that clear."
"What about my dad's car?"
"You know it is."
"An incredible thing happened to me."
"Yes, that's what I wanted."
"Of course you can't."
"Well, enjoy your party, Your Majesty."
"It was a while ago."
"Did you have a visitor tonight?"
"I know, I have perfect pitch."
"Do you know what's going to happen to you?"
"After all we've done?"
"You tell me when, that's all."
"I don't think he hears."
"It's just a routine check."
"One km without tailing, that's won."
"What does that inspire in you?"
"It's been like this since this morning."
"My license plate says 'inspector'."
"Can we know what it is?"
"What if he doesn't survive?"
"Do I look like a thief?"
"Do you have an answer for that too?"
"Have you seen Bates's mother?"
"Yeah, that's what it sounds like."
"There is hope, yes."
"It's inside you."
"It sends shivers down my spine."
"I've never seen him do it."
"He's going to screw everything up."
"I've been looking for you all night."
"That's my wife's name."
"We'll get you to safety."
"For once, they're doing their job."
"It's up to you to sort this out."
"He would do anything for her."
"You just have to stay there."
"Can I get you something to drink?"
"An ace, when you've trained."
"Have you had several boyfriends before?"
"Did he close the front door?"
"And what can I do for you?"
"I already have what I need."
"I want to be a good person."
"You are in charge of this City."
"The official photo, where do I take that?"
"You're hoping to have a stillborn baby."
"Thank you for dinner and the evening."
"She's not an ordinary girl."
"How good to see you."
"Maybe one of these days."
"Lord, what are we doing?"
"So far, has she confessed?"
"Please straighten the backs of your seats."
"There are people there."
"What are you doing, Doc?"
"I learned this at school."
"Don't you want to be with me?"
"You better come get me."
"We had ten years of peace."
"You left early in the morning."
"I know how to handle him."
"I had a brilliant idea."
"I was going to make him a big star."
"I have an appointment at the hairdresser's."
"But here, pride comes first."
"Nice to meet you both."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a historic moment."
"Do I know anything about diamonds?"
"Is there something going on between you?"
"Do you have a reason to be?"
"As soon as he licks your pussy."
"From then on, I knew."
"You know you can't."
"Let's see what else we have."
"It's just the way he is."
"I'll get you another drink."
"It's money well spent."
"No, it's not your fault."
"When can we be on air?"
"We made you the best possible."
"I watched it all night."
"Norman told him about the girl."
"Don't get on my side."
"What do you want me to do now?"
"Sorry for what he said."
"How are things going at school?"
"You said that last time."
"Is there a place for me?"
"Japanese men don't do that."
"What's going on, old man?"
"I was just trying to lighten the mood."
"The girl who lives there was lovely."
"I just wanted her to be happy."
"Professor Jones needs space."
"What am I supposed to do with this?"
"This is the reason for our presence."
"This is a good idea, do you think?"
"It was his idea, not mine."
"No, I'm not one."
"What do I have here?"
"I'm going to have to ask you some questions."
"Dad plays golf with this guy."
"Everyone has a hobby."
"You didn't say anything at all."
"But drugs are the future."
"I make the law."
"I thought it might be useful."
"I never trusted you."
"I have to go to the bathroom for a minute."
"What do you see in them?"
"May I join you, Esteban?"
"Noah, what are you doing?"
"Are you with me or against me?"
"You're looking for a partner, right?"
"What did we forget?"
"Tell me what you want to do."
"You can see I'm busy."
"His reputation sticks to him."
"I will bring him to the Bahamas myself."
"Can I be driven back to the airport?"
"You talked throughout the presentation."
"We know what we saw."
"Well, that's the end of the book."
"I will do what needs to be done."
"Are you allowed to be here?"
"It is sail and steam powered."
"A bag instead of a belly."
"The best thing that ever happened to me."
"Would you have preferred it to be me?"
"What did you do to your face?"
"I took this from her dress."
"I think it's for me."
"That's what we all do."
"He got along with everyone."
"I found this in his things."
"How do you know it's me?"
"No, you don't need it."
"I am the hotel manager."
"I think we can do it."
"Is that the name of the city?"
"There are a whole series of them."
"Do you want to spend the night there?"
"Do you believe the Grail really exists?"
"They think he is a prophet."
"One last measure and it's done."
"You said we were chosen."
"You can say it to my face."
"At night there were lights."
"It looks like they fought."
"Don't you think you're exaggerating?"
"I signed a confidentiality agreement."
"Please be nice, this is my first client."
"I just want a glass of water."
"There is no glass."
"It's worth a visit."
"Where could we go?"
"What happened after that?"
"Is that the role?"
"He has certainly already found the Grail."
"I have other patients to see."
"I will stay as long as necessary."
"There are only our men."
"You can't even say it."
"What I ask of them is doable."
"I have answered all your questions."
"I decided to trust you."
"They say the world will be wonderful."
"He's about my height."
"I'll make a deal between us."
"She's nice, isn't she?"
"How long have you known me?"
"That's what you should do."
"Sit on the bench to wait."
"We'll do it with or without you."
"How does it feel to be back?"
"What have you done with your life?"
"She's been like this since you came back."
"Can't we change the subject?"
"You have to leave it to us."
"At least let him take a bath."
"Do you know why she said that?"
"That's where they come from."
"I have an appointment with the dentist."
"A bit of a reflection of the real world."
"That's what parents do."
"I'm just changing tickets."
"Do you want me to write it for you?"
"I want you to believe in me."
"According to the directory, it's here."
"Love shouldn't be secret."
"What happened to your foot?"
"You're the only one who knows her."
"She is in the waiting room."
"Can't read English?"
"I want to know who he's talking to."
"Take the mayor with his girlfriend."
"She said she was a cop."
"Come on, I have a surprise for you."
"That's what I believe too."
"What does he think about all this?"
"I don't want her to leave."
"You have some nerve coming here."
"I guess that's a start."
"He would do it if he could."
"When I'm free, one weekend."
"I thought it was in the past."
"Do you know about the trial?"
"He's been seeing one for some time."
"Maybe it's time for a change."
"How did I not see it?"
"She is always on the edge of the abyss."
"Can Spider-Man come play with me?"
"We have to face reality."
"I was like you at your age."
"You must have had a nice childhood."
"So you know what it is."
"She didn't have to."
"What will he think?"
"I hope we can sort everything out."
"You hired him."
"His wallet and keys are inside."
"Tell me what he said."
"He leaves because he has to."
"I don't need her anymore."
"A sandwich, while you're at it."
"I'm not quite right anymore."
"Something is stirring in the east."
"Put this in the trunk and come back."
"What exactly does this treatment consist of?"
"You didn't even think about it?"
"How can you think such a thing?"
"We need to be able to reach him everywhere."
"You want to know how I know?"
"There's enough for two."
"What did he find?"
"There was a car in the driveway."
"I am my father's son."
"It was a few days ago."
"It's time for my shot."
"I hope we can remain friends."
"Who else is inside?"
"When the big moment comes, let me know."
"Let's say someone who collects them."
"I think they're going to kidnap her."
"Marie packed Madame's luggage."
"That was a nice move, Your Majesty."
"I'll remember that next time."
"Where is the nearest hospital?"
"Give it to me, please."
"I hope everything works out."
"Once we fought and died together."
"During the day, it's good for sleeping."
"And what did he tell you?"
"Please come and sit down."
"What if it's not her?"
"You need people like me."
"She said she was fine."
"Look at the passion on this wall."
"I do whatever it takes."
"Of course, who do you take me for?"
"I must have read that somewhere."
"You've got a message."
"He's the one who writes the script."
"Of course, whatever you want."
"I emptied the rest of the bottle."
"I only saw her once."
"And I think Doug was there."
"Items of great value, Your Highness."
"What kind of motivation do you need?"
"It all depends on what you want."
"Why do you always talk to me like that?"
"Oh, what are you doing?"
"Who brought them?"
"On a scale of one to ten."
"When they need you, yes."
"Have you talked to your parents about it?"
"Do you have any questions for me?"
"We don't care about your series."
"We found this in his room."
"All for one and one for all."
"What is the next goal of the project?"
"I've always been honest with you."
"What's better?"
"That's what my father wanted."
"I need you to sign this."
"And that's what you do."
"This is what you have to find out."
"This is one of my favorite movies."
"I saw him, with his suitcase."
"What do you want to happen to me?"
"She must be at the hotel, right?"
"That's why it works."
"You tell me that every time."
"I have a beautiful white lounge chair."
"Is this what's going on?"
"Do you get along well with your father?"
"I thought we were having fun."
"Who will play my role?"
"This is company policy."
"Where did you learn English, Tony?"
"What should I write?"
"We'll meet back here in two hours."
"It's time we met."
"You're fine, I have to go."
"I'll get you to use them."
"Is it because I'm white?"
"It's at the house's expense."
"And you, could you find some pants?"
"There's always an answer, Tony."
"You have the newspaper in your pocket."
"No, it really wasn't far off."
"She couldn't do it."
"Someone will take care of you."
"It's just us now."
"All you have to do is give it to him."
"You can expect five more."
"I'll tell you who I am."
"It feels like we're there."
"We have the number and address."
"Where did he learn negotiation?"
"There's one over there."
"Hundreds of lives are at stake."
"It's up to us to judge."
"That's very generous of him."
"He will blend into the crowd."
"This is the key, I know it."
"What's going on, boss?"
"This is a big step for me."
"Of course, that's what I'm here for."
"Mr. Ho, haven't you had lunch?"
"Is what she says true?"
"She was the light of my life."
"I'll need you later."
"She can't marry a guy like that."
"I won't let that happen."
"Do you know what you remind me of?"
"Tell me what happened to him."
"I think I'll stay longer."
"She shouldn't have mentioned it."
"I'm going to a three-day seminar."
"And that really pisses us off."
"One more trip should be enough."
"You'll have a great story to tell."
"I wanted to see what you would do."
"Come with us, please."
"I see what you are doing."
"My name is Human Spider."
"Because tomorrow the sun will rise."
"You were right about the wedding ring too."
"Call me for the teeth type."
"We trusted you, and rightly so."
"What matters most?"
"But first, I want real proof."
"You do the best you can."
"I really want to go there."
"He said he would think about it."
"I have to do what is right."
"Are you saying this to me in front of my son?"
"I thought I had left the National."
"What would you do with it?"
"Can you see us without the sheets?"
"I've had enough, that's all."
"You are the child who survived."
"Go ahead, I'll be right there."
"Do you let him talk to you like that?"
"It's just you and me now."
"I need it more than you do."
"And what do you see?"
"No, there are too many people."
"I usually do it."
"I'm going to Mexico with my wife."
"I saw the guest list."
"Maybe it's a secret love."
"It's the first door on the right."
"Do you want to know what's real?"
"She's been here for about six hours."
"People are being murdered every day."
"I saw how he looked at you."
"We're going to do great things together."
"There is a very beautiful beach."
"He led us into a swamp."
"Don't screw this up."
"For me too, it was wonderful."
"I have a husband and a son."
"You are all I want."
"You got what you deserved."
"What happened to my wife?"
"I feel as big as a mountain."
"I know what they can do."
"And what does that change?"
"Raise your right hand, please."
"There may be an explanation."
"Was I right or was I right?"
"Marla needs a social worker."
"Don't ask where he got it."
"I don't need excuses."
"Did he tell you where he was going?"
"I have to tell you everything."
"I know you mean well."
"People only talk about that."
"You're not inviting me in?"
"How did this flower get here?"
"I like you, Donald, you know?"
"A place for my friend and me?"
"You didn't tell him about it?"
"What does she think about it?"
"I have someone in my life."
"Take what you want and leave."
"You took me in your arms."
"No, there won't be."
"What do you think is going on?"
"Grab your things, we're leaving."
"Pay attention to how you feel."
"But we can't do that."
"Or I make porridge out of it."
"Don't try to bend the spoon."
"I'll get you to safety."
"What happened to my daughter?"
"It already only existed halfway."
"What are they doing now?"
"This turkey is a little dry, isn't it?"
"I said I admired you."
"Dad saw you on the course."
"Is there anyone with him?"
"A lawyer may attend the interrogation."
"This is my father's house."
"Here is the answer to all the riddles."
"Are you having a good evening at Babylon?"
"But you have to be a hero."
"I hope he pulls through."
"The house had become a living thing."
"Yes, that's what we thought."
"Better now that I've seen it."
"Of course I read it."
"You think I knew that Stu?"
"What have you achieved thanks to me?"
"I'm sure you understand me."
"What if she doesn't make it?"
"We'll see each other again in another life."
"You remember my son Samuel."
"Whatever you want, my love."
"I would be careful if I were you."
"It was so that he would love me."
"I hope this is the last one."
"You have to do the right thing."
"Do you know what he means?"
"Remember our last drink together."
"You are not paid to think."
"Do you know someone who would be interested?"
"He was so good to me."
"What do you think I should do?"
"And I want to keep it that way."
"What do I get from you?"
"Is there no hope?"
"I'll tell your father."
"His compassion for you will be his downfall."
"You always took care of me."
"But finally, what is happening?"
"Maybe nothing is being done."
"This is where it ends."
"What, you don't trust me?"
"That's right, you don't understand."
"No, I'll take care of it myself."
"He's my love, my whole life."
"In my office, please."
"Put your arms around my neck."
"Do you think I should go?"
"I wonder what they are doing."
"I said to go around."
"Do you know how many there are?"
"That is very noble of you."
"Did the guy take a long time to come?"
"According to Diane and Eve, he loved her."
"I'm telling you what I know."
"So what is it about?"
"It's better that we separate."
"Let's go talk at my place, if you like."
"Are you particularly interested in music?"
"I worked with him in Tucson."
"I should have told you the truth."
"For you, it's in the bag."
"It's the only thing that works."
"You're the one calling the shots."
"You could set up a studio there."
"I know you don't understand."
"On a new one starting out, for example."
"That's when everything changed."
"Afterwards, you will do what you want."
"You have written a lot about workers."
"What do I want to do?"
"You keep saying it."
"You have to go through the service door."
"What, what are you saying?"
"I made it for my daughter."
"You seem to be doing better."
"But more importantly, we have the plan."
"There are a lot of people here."
"I have to go, see you later."
"You come to me with a proposition."
"I saw how you look at her."
"This is an important moment for me."
"She told me a lot about you."
"But I want to face them with you."
"I told you this morning."
"Some of our men will come here."
"She is in my prayer group."
"But what are they making?"
"Taste the life of a simple man."
"Have you done any research on me?"
"I'll show you where it is."
"What matters is the Grail."
"Remember our friend Doug?"
"Alright, what's going on?"
"You prefer women to money."
"To make sure everything is okay."
"There's something I'm missing."
"I'm asking her."
"I'll take the same thing as him."
"I sent you an email."
"I heard about this guy."
"This is how we move forward."
"I had never had an accident."
"I need to make some calls."
"Shawn, what are you doing?"
"That's how you win."
"I took her to the hospital."
"And she was really nice to you."
"I'm going to have to ask you to step out."
"I'm the one who's leaving."
"I had everything I wanted."
"There is nothing sexual."
"I think I like him."
"Are you the one who treated me?"
"I can take you back, if you want."
"Hey Superstar, it's Marty Super Agent."
"That's what I need."
"Sorry, we don't have any more space."
"I just came to say goodbye."
"Finally, we will make ourselves known to the Jedi."
"I want to see someone else."
"Let's hope He is on our side."
"I came to make a deal."
"But it is a matter of principle."
"He tears the skin off his fingers."
"Something is happening there."
"Everything is as I found it."
"Where have you been these past few weeks?"
"Any idea who did this?"
"And what am I selling?"
"Tell me what happened to you."
"No, we can't say that."
"I know you have rehearsals."
"She's not family."
"Other than that, not a word."
"This is the only one we have."
"Bring Amy to Sasha's birthday."
"I've been looking for her all my life."
"What do you think would be a reasonable price?"
"But not on this matter, on you."
"What happened to the crew?"
"It comes from the embassy itself."
"How long did it take you?"
"I came to find my father."
"It's for your own good, my boy."
"Ships passing in the night."
"First, your family must release my sisters."
"I received a letter from him."
"How to speak a language without knowing it?"
"Because of who I am?"
"A secret badge for the secret service."
"It's important that you eat everything."
"I have other things on my mind."
"I need the money tomorrow."
"I want you to tell me everything."
"I thought you didn't have any."
"How did you know I'd be there?"
"You know who that is, I imagine?"
"Arrange it with my concierge first."
"They say they have two kilos to start with."
"May I ask who you are?"
"I thought that was the point."
"I took you for a thief."
"I'll tell him you called."
"What is he trying to tell us?"
"And how are things going for you?"
"Is the dark side stronger?"
"Is there food on board?"
"I have been with you for so long."
"Mick, you have heart like no one else."
"Don't you want to have some fun?"
"I put a lot of effort into it."
"I spent a lot of time there."
"What can happen to you?"
"We'll see you on the other side."
"Is there anyone left?"
"They are smarter than you think."
"I can show you how to reach them."
"That's what we're going to determine."
"He took a child with him."
"On you and the Jew's wife."
"It's an old man's sport."
"Is there hot water?"
"Maybe it's not the right time."
"And now he's the one getting divorced."
"Is the security device in place?"
"Is that all they want?"
"We have to go there."
"Maybe this is paradise?"
"That's what he wrote."
"We need to call the police."
"He treated you like a royal visitor."
"He has other things on his mind."
"The President will be here in three hours."
"You're a long way from home, Captain."
"What if I wasn't?"
"There are twenty of us waiting for confirmation."
"Are you blaming this on me?"
"The Knight takes the Queen, you see?"
"They did this."
"Or prepare to reap the whirlwind."
"This is an interesting point of view."
"I want to do something good."
"I'll clear this all up."
"It would give you the strength to act."
"Have you talked about it with your mother?"
"What if you don't?"
"First I would like more sheep."
"I don't think he speaks English."
"I hope we see each other again soon."
"I bought it last week."
"I need to take a walk."
"She is no longer of this world."
"I wanted to see you one last time."
"Men, that's what we are."
"They say that God has abandoned them."
"That's why I drink."
"Hey, do you want a glass of water?"
"They want you to speak more clearly."
"The Age of Men has ended."
"This offer is non-negotiable and final."
"I was just checking to see if everything was okay."
"It's his mother's funeral."
"A composer occupies the studio opposite."
"I was the one who suggested it to him."
"Is this God's world?"
"We can hear you all over the neighborhood."
"Show him what you can do."
"There is only one Lawrence."
"You're going to have to accept it."
"It's time to relax."
"I have an appointment with the doctor."
"I had an affair with her."
"Is that how you talk?"
"I don't want ordinary men."
"Do we understand each other well?"
"You told me about intelligence."
"Is there a law against this?"
"I thought you would agree."
"I have respect for that kid."
"It's fine with me if it's fine with you."
"You can be proud of your son."
"Please promise me."
"Tell me what's going on here."
"Maybe that's why I'm here."
"Matthew is a charming and intelligent boy."
"Stanley is not a good swimmer."
"Inside there is a famous wizard."
"I'll tell you what I want."
"After all, we're going to the morgue."
"I swear I don't know."
"It's better here than up there."
"I thought it was the other way around."
"Do you believe in the friendship of peoples?"
"What do you want to do for your birthday?"
"It must be some kind of record."
"No time to think about girls."
"Did she tell you to say that?"
"Because he's never there."
"I know what he's going to say."
"The father, God knows where he is."
"It was her, wasn't it?"
"We do what we are told."
"You are a goddess, a living legend."
"I'll make you a nice coffee."
"If that's what she wants."
"Everyone is inside."
"Only with two drops of French perfume."
"Finally, in better places than here?"
"This is my wife's car."
"Rome is the statue, I see."
"What time should we go to bed?"
"Can I stay, please?"
"No, but I know who you are."
"There's my pager number."
"She had Liz Taylor's eyes."
"I wish you would."
"Do you see the woman at the window?"
"She has everything she needs."
"Pay him and give him soap."
"Probably the best thing to do."
"Are you sure it's God?"
"The device exploded underwater."
"Just a minute, please."
"You know the answer to this question."
"What did she know about it?"
"He is one of the kings of narcotics."
"I made my money with Jackson."
"You did something good."
"I can also write you a check."
"Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served."
"I am here to learn from you."
"But be careful how you say it."
"You're a bit of a merchant, after all."
"I took a pregnancy test."
"I think it's a woman."
"He had bars on his window."
"This is the pardon of the Attorney General."
"Go see if the tractor is intact."
"The inspector told us all this."
"After all you've done?"
"But call the San Antonio office."
"Do you want to ask me any more questions?"
"No one else should know."
"You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
"I assure you it is true."
"You've never seen it work?"
"I have a Father in heaven."
"I would have given my life for him."
"I never return to a market."
"One of my old roommates lives here."
"The Emperor orders you to contact him."
"I thought we were going to your place."
"You are in the middle of the road."
"Didn't she tell you anything about me?"
"What's in the briefcase?"
"You have a spot on your nose."
"I think this is my glass."
"It's about my son."
"The day your daughter gets married."
"I think you'll like this."
"At the end of the rainbow."
"You all know what I want."
"And the old men make peace."
"It seems like you're enjoying it."
"I called when I arrived in Madrid."
"But how does he know about the treasure?"
"I want to see what it looks like."
"She's much prettier in reality."
"We have a long road ahead of us."
"There must be other ways."
"I filled the plane with supplies."
"Let him tell me himself."
"Your cell phone or whatever."
"Terry over there takes care of the betting."
"We are surrounded by Russian submarines."
"And offer to take this off for me."
"Would you like us a cup of coffee?"
"I'm in the Army, actually."
"Can't they go back to the jungle?"
"Tell me about your time in the hospital."
"It's the best thing in the world."
"What did you say to the police?"
"I really want to give you a chance."
"No one will love you as much as I do."
"Manhunt in the city."
"M.L.F., have you heard?"
"I found it in your bag."
"He shot him in the head."
"It's easier than you think."
"Would you like to show it to your agent?"
"I will do as you please, Yoda."
"They say you were very well."
"He writes about war heroes."
"He looked into her eyes."
"But promise to keep it to yourself."
"You wouldn't happen to have a match, would you?"
"We have each other."
"We have so much in common."
"You will find it in the forward hold."
"I saw enough last night."
"I wonder where he went."
"I know I saw it."
"What do they want again?"
"Boris, we have all kinds of sandwiches."
"You're doing better than me."
"But it's not just that."
"It's her wedding day."
"Should arms sales be controlled?"
"I'll do it my way."
"It allows me to control these arms."
"I hear you're a genius."
"You know you want to do it."
"Give me a reason to do it."
"I will do anything to make you happy."
"Do you want to know my name?"
"I believe in what I do."
"You must be ready for tomorrow."
"It's a bit windy."
"You are the one who betrayed me."
"I had an incredible night."
"I should have said this earlier."
"I'm still in working order."
"Isn't that reason enough?"
"I only thought of myself."
"There are many believers and curious people."
"If you have a family, leave it."
"That's exactly what I want."
"Do you want me to do it for you?"
"I want you to be yourself."
"No, you don't want to do that."
"All's well that ends well, right?"
"It's really nice to see you."
"I mean, what is this?"
"I've only known you for one night."
"I couldn't stop thinking about it."
"What does this have to do with anything?"
"You don't have a boyfriend?"
"I guess I should thank you."
"I tried to explain it to him."
"It's settled with this half portion."
"I'll tell you something, Mr."
"It's out of the question now."
"You had the green light to leave."
"You'll never guess who's here."
"You have to arrive on time."
"I have something else to ask you."
"A word to one of you."
"What is he, then?"
"You're fine, that's the main thing."
"It seems to be very beautiful."
"It comes from the reactor wall."
"I just wanted to know who it was."
"This is where I belong."
"You make things come up in me."
"I brought you some clean clothes."
"As a last resort, target sensitive areas."
"You had to see it to believe it."
"I have just turned a new page."
"And that's priceless."
"I look at him and he's about to leave."
"He recognized something in you."
"And it made me feel good."
"My mother is a very important woman."
"These are the last infantry reinforcements."
"I gave them a hand."
"We'll meet in half an hour."
"She was talking to me."
"A life she cannot share."
"Did you learn that on your screen?"
"But here I ask your permission."
"You think so and you are right."
"Thanks for the tip, Brick Head."
"I think we have a winner."
"I had something in my eye."
"For old coffee, it's good."
"And what does he want?"
"They say they don't understand."
"Good news, we found your Mercedes."
"The whole world will pay to see this."
"A cream tone would give more light."
"It's good to see you here."
"I need to call my mother."
"Do you think he'll like it?"
"They got Sonny on the highway."
"A great opportunity presents itself to us."
"I won it in a bet."
"I didn't talk about you."
"What would we have done in his place?"
"Until we catch him."
"I want you to call the police."
"I'm the one leading the dance."
"Children, your room is on the right."
"I wanted to tell you earlier."
"Yeah, that's what I do."
"Good accounts make good friends."
"Did you read it in his eyes?"
"We're having a drink, that's all."
"Are you talking bad about the family?"
"I was always there for him."
"The security code has been changed."
"The Cylons knew exactly where to find us."
"I'll see you again at that university course."
"She gave me money."
"I saw your taxi park."
"Are you still going to school?"
"A contract that is, two years."
"I don't have the courage anymore."
"Abraham Lincoln meets a Golden Family."
"But I need a favor."
"I will pay for them with my life, Judas."
"There was only one guy."
"I almost pooped my pants."
"What does she say about it?"
"Can't you go get it?"
"What happened in this room?"
"But we are very different boxers."
"I have a sense of crowd."
"What compels my admiration?"
"He's coming back and we have to go."
"What if he doesn't show up?"
"I introduce this guy to some guys."
"We found it at the library."
"I still have one thing to do."
"I say the hare will be fucked."
"I know you said it."
"I never had a son."
"People called him through an intermediary."
"Better late than never, I guess."
"Don't you want to play with me?"
"She didn't say much."
"What happened to your family?"
"Do you know how this restaurant works?"
"That's what my friends say."
"Can I see your driver's license?"
"You can send me anywhere."
"Tell us what we want to know."
"My mother used it for sewing."
"But there is an important difference."
"No need, it's all there."
"You want to play hard to get with me?"
"There was something between us."
"Maybe we went too fast."
"Do you see the chest movements?"
"I think you did well."
"But what if he doesn't like Romania?"
"No, that's not an option."
"We don't care about his name."
"Jim, what are you doing?"
"I think it was Lars."
"Go to this comedian's son's house."
"But what if it had been more important?"
"I make the rules."
"Are you thinking of someone else?"
"This is a great moment for us."
"I must say universal peace."
"How did you know where to find me?"
"They'll fill your ears."
"It's time to give it back to you."
"He is harder than a nail."
"What are you going to do for your Talent?"
"You said it was over."
"That was three weeks ago."
"I have answered enough questions."
"No one knows what he looks like."
"First choice, and first hand."
"As soon as he's here, call us."
"Not that you have tons of it."
"The channel wants a facelift."
"What do you think they're talking about?"
"Come back here, I want to talk to you again."
"They have never seen such artillery."
"I knew you would come for me."
"I could talk about it all night."
"Can we sit down and talk business?"
"No, I never have been."
"What did you do with my kid?"
"I need to know now if it fits."
"Do you want him to talk or not?"
"They pursue the vanquished after the battle."
"It's such an emotion for her."
"And that's from me."
"I'm glad you said that."
"Are all these drawings yours, doctor?"
"And you, you who are in mourning."
"I suggested that she get married."
"Here is a good opportunity to do so."
"Who told you to say that?"
"I think you could say that."
"Are you judging me by my size?"
"I'm killing myself trying to tell you this."
"No, he couldn't come."
"You will need their cooperation."
"One thing led to another."
"This place is getting on my nerves."
"You know what I'm telling you?"
"He'll be here in an hour."
"That's where we'll find him."
"I'm living it."
"I have to make some phone calls."
"This is the real American dream."
"Some more scotch for mom."
"You haven't changed either."
"I won't need this anymore."
"Crawford wants to see you in his office."
"Take the helm, okay, buddy?"
"See you in the operating room."
"And what do you give on the water?"
"Will I be in contact with them?"
"Please let me finish."
"Do you want me to call a doctor?"
"A big prize offered by Air France."
"You need structure, discipline."
"Call it a friend, if you will."
"What are you guys doing tonight?"
"That's life, that's all."
"This one had a plum-colored dress."
"It's like a license to fly."
"Can't we resolve our differences?"
"No, I'm giving him something to think about."
"This is not just anything."
"What is your mother's name?"
"Do you want us to take care of it?"
"Everyone should have one."
"She has something in her throat."
"She would never have left her wedding ring."
"The Pittsburgh guys wanted guns."
"I thought it was the delivery man."
"Do you think I'll tell him?"
"Are you going for a walk in the park?"
"I don't know anyone named Iris."
"You have the right to be happy."
"You've been talking about your wife forever."
"We can come back tomorrow with my son."
"That was before I knew him."
"I don't think that will happen."
"They didn't ask you?"
"Music is for everyone."
"Yeah, that's what I want."
"And me, do I count for nothing?"
"You forgot the Turkish military hospital."
"You should have taken better care of me."
"She should have been here hours ago."
"I want to do what you do."
"I hope he's not mean."
"Put them in the bag, will you?"
"No need to go any further."
"They must have done something to us."
"I said I loved him."
"No, I wouldn't know what to do with it."
"He's at that table over there."
"You dare to speak to me in that tone?"
"Welcome, Jesus, I congratulate you."
"I need more space."
"And that's what you got."
"We emptied the shed and the lab."
"My Bigfoot photo was different."
"In the style of the Military March."
"That thing I told you about."
"Do you want me to call the boss?"
"That's what I wrote."
"I've been waiting for this all day."
"Not if I see you first."
"I'll be back as soon as it's ready."
"Is that what you heard?"
"You want your story told."
"White wine, please."
"You talk about them and yourself."
"Is that what being discreet means to you?"
"He has something in his mouth."
"What will they say?"
"You can't drive like that."
"He got a weak tea yesterday."
"They decided everything."
"What do you think of Italian cuisine?"
"You have to stay out of this."
"I hope you can understand."
"You have to know what you're doing."
"There may be no one there."
"He was the love of his life."
"This is my parents' house."
"I want to invite you to something."
"Tell him it's for me."
"I gained a little weight."
"We are doing a concert with the choir."
"After what he did to me?"
"An old friend who visits you."
"Do you know when you have to go to bed?"
"Yes, we don't see many Dwarf Women."
"That's basically what I am."
"How many cameras did you have on you?"
"Protecting these girls is my job."
"You will need two more types."
"I think they liked it."
"A psychology exercise, of sorts."
"Have we met somewhere before?"
"Do you feel my hand on the back of your neck?"
"You know what I read?"
"I have other sources of income."
"I think he passed out."
"I'll call you as soon as I know."
"This is my favorite picture of you."
"Everyone has been so kind."
"Are you blind?"
"I wonder where he can be."
"Please let me through."
"Who cares anyway?"
"You must give me strength."
"That's where the heart is."
"I kept it as best I could."
"Do you think it's smart to skip school?"
"No, you never did anything."
"And his daughter, as a means of pressure?"
"What did you order?"
"Is it normal for him to do this?"
"I have rights over this man."
"Do you think it's a homicide?"
"It seems he likes guns."
"Mom will take you home."
"I think the same about you."
"That's very nice of you."
"I need you there."
"That's why tomorrow it will be moved elsewhere."
"Okay if you eat a little."
"That's what they always say."
"What does she want again?"
"I want to take her home."
"Moe Greene is going to sell us his shares."
"He wants the Ring, that's all."
"You can tell me your name."
"I know what's at stake."
"People are who they are."
"I love you and will see you soon."
"We protect others to protect ourselves."
"That's what mothers do."
"I think this is the last one."
"I know you're in there."
"This city is full of good memories."
"I said I love you."
"How long did I look for her?"
"I called you on your cell phone."
"Just outside the city."
"Traces of life were captured."
"You're like a brother to me."
"Is that your picture in the newspaper?"
"Glad you realize that."
"That's what we need."
"She has her whole life ahead of her."
"Do you want me to take you there?"
"Lola put me on the straw."
"It's true that he is cute."
"Tony, what are you doing?"
"This is one of my favorite songs."
"No, it's not a simulation."
"You know he was a Jedi."
"I have to go up to the office."
"And this one is still with us."
"It's a crucial business evening."
"He's one of your colleagues."
"For safety reasons, the hotel must be evacuated."
"As long as we get our share."
"What are you hungry and thirsty for?"
"I was going to tell you tonight."
"Do you know who is behind all this?"
"She didn't open her mouth."
"I'll have to talk to him."
"What do you think we should do?"
"Tell me you have a plan."
"I have something on the go."
"It's been like this for an hour."
"It looks like you're selling toothpaste."
"That's why they come."
"She's an old friend of mine."
"We will settle the score with this family."
"Few people knew where they were."
"Look what the cat brought back."
"Come with me to the house."
"He's fine, you see, normal."
"Isn't life wonderful?"
"You're not normal, she's right."
"No, it's while playing basketball."
"That's what they're going to do."
"And you know what I think?"
"I would have told them who I am."
"Or rather, you ask their permission."
"Yes, half an hour ago."
"There's the Eiffel Tower there."
"Love is sweet as honey."
"You have nothing to say to him?"
"But I've never played it."
"I think I made myself clear."
"Do you want to know who my God is?"
"I know where I saw you."
"The inmates are ready for inspection."
"But I think I love you."
"Show him you can do it."
"I play cards with my father."
"It's a business meeting."
"You could have told me the truth."
"I'll be back before dark."
"Come give your dad a hug."
"Do you know all the girls here?"
"I wish I had more time."
"You will find it hanging from a nail."
"Do you still have faith, Father?"
"What do you want to be called?"
"Is this life yours?"
"Because you are my best friend."
"I told you to watch her."
"Like you did for me."
"Do you think we have a chance?"
"Anyway, I drink more of it."
"I will give everything I have."
"Shine the parquet floor with pads."
"She called half of Barcelona."
"Do I look like a caterer?"
"But I wanted you to know."
"Don't you want me to come with you?"
"If you know, tell me."
"This one sticks to your stomach."
"I found this in your pocket."
"Ask them if they want a drink."
"I have a daughter the same age."
"Is that why you're leaving?"
"Let Sol and I play this."
"What can I get you to drink?"
"You've known her all her life."
"I don't have the strength anymore."
"I'll call him on his cell phone."
"I didn't think I'd kiss a snake."
"I don't need the details."
"Go get some dry land, old man."
"Come in, this is your moment to shine."
"I used a new conditioner."
"I will make a pact with you."
"We take life as it comes."
"This is what Europeans want."
"She told me herself."
"I'm trying to cheer you up."
"It's just that you're not listening."
"He's like that before a match."
"I've been waiting for you all these years."
"She thought we were having an affair."
"It's inside me."
"Except he isn't."
"I told him about these things."
"I had three weeks of training."
"Do you really mean what you say?"
"You look healthy."
"Looks like the party is over."
"No, I have nothing to say."
"The Citizen acted here first."
"Yes, you are absolutely right."
"Give me a little more time."
"But what's happening to him?"
"I told you he would come."
"I think we can do better."
"Hold this for me, please."
"But we caught him in time."
"I often pass by, and I see you."
"What do you want, huh?"
"I bought it for my father."
"Aren't we in the Matrix?"
"They made a record here recently."
"I forgot to ask his name."
"I can tell you where he is."
"No, we need to talk about it."
"So go ahead and let us think."
"Where are you coming from at this hour?"
"Maybe now is the time."
"How long did you live there?"
"Do you work for the railways?"
"You tell me, right?"
"Can you take me home?"
"You have a wife and children."
"That's what the legend says."
"No one can hold a candle to him."
"They're always ahead in California."
"I saw her last week."
"What happened to this place?"
"How is the honeymoon going?"
"He's probably a good person."
"I thought it would never happen."
"No one will know it's you."
"It really is the end of the world."
"What kind of guy are you, huh?"
"We put whatever we want in it."
"I am at peace with myself."
"Just a year ago."
"I was talking to him."
"I am with you all the way."
"I told my wife."
"What's making that noise?"
"This is exactly what we do."
"That's exactly what we do."
"Because I knew what she was singing."
"Recently surrendered to the CIA."
"She knew what was going to happen."
"It's a young girl's name."
"Not one of your mercenary boyfriends."
"You, what do you want?"
"You're my brother, act like it."
"What is she going to say?"
"Is this our friend's fiancée?"
"He is the one who makes the law."
"I'll get the hors d'oeuvres."
"I don't have confidence in myself."
"Who do you want me to talk about?"
"Yes, that's what I was saying."
"But let me tell you one thing."
"It's my mother's first name."
"Instead, what did he say?"
"I spent time with him."
"Whatever it may cost you."
"They are only found in Asia."
"He may have photographed the attacker."
"I have two things to tell you."
"He told me to come here."
"Do you think he's in there?"
"We're going to be here for a while."
"I want you to see something."
"I'm glad I saw you."
"You'll see what I'm capable of."
"Who else lives in this house?"
"He's making a ton of money."
"Not in front of Sugar Ray, right, Mick?"
"I love you more than myself."
"We treat you the way you treat us."
"But how am I going to pay for all this?"
"You just have to remember that."
"That you do something for me."
"Where are my wife and son?"
"Remember that guy in Texas?"
"Were you there when it happened?"
"Tell me if you see anything."
"That's your name, right?"
"You mean she'll be there?"
"I'll go with you if you want."
"We need to take him to the infirmary."
"I love doing plant mutation."
"He thinks you're the best."
"What don't you want anymore?"
"You'll see, it will be better tomorrow morning."
"I had never seen the ocean."
"I haven't heard from him."
"And before, was this your home?"
"And you did yours."
"I read that in a book."
"Tell them what they want to hear."
"I can show you how it works."
"They would have sent someone else."
"Many are near, praise the Lord."
"I'm above all that."
"Did I talk to you last time?"
"All right, I'll be right back."
"I just need to talk to him."
"I thought I was the only one."
"What is your talent?"
"He was going to screw everything up."
"I'll tell you where it leads."
"Your feelings betrayed her too."
"Listen to what he has to say."
"I make love, not war."
"I'll take us all the way."
"We live in a very real world."
"What is there to think about?"
"Put Captain Solo in the hold."
"So we have something in common."
"I tell you it's him."
"You are the only one who understands me."
"You know what I want?"
"I put it in a box."
"Tell him it's our baby."
"I'm the one who arranged everything."
"You are my eyes and ears."
"We'll take care of the rest later."
"It's my sister's birthday."
"May you find your friend Spider-Man."
"Even a dog has more luck."
"Or is there something else?"
"I see what this is about."
"Thousands of years ago."
"This is the goal of the operation."
"It's better they don't come."
"I'm waiting for a boyfriend, that's all."
"I got a good price for it."
"It's nice of you to remind me."
"I didn't ask for this marriage."
"For that, you have to work for yourself."
"She's all I have left."
"Friends who don't even write?"
"My father did his best."
"I make sure everything is okay."
"Can I stay with a reduced team?"
"Is that what he was thinking?"
"Sir, what are you doing?"
"I always ran away from these situations."
"This is Madeleine in a different light."
"I've been wanting to tell you this for a long time."
"I'm still dreaming."
"You can think whatever you want."
"It was old age attacking youth."
"I did it for my son."
"Can you give me a tour now?"
"No need for miracles for the Messiah."
"He has a lot on his mind."
"And I have a lot of things in it."
"It reminds us how beautiful the world is."
"He says that to everyone."
"I wonder what it was."
"Here, we pay everything at once."
"It's bigger than I thought."
"What the hell are you doing, Tony?"
"Go to the police station for your statement."
"I want you to be my witness."
"Any idea where he went?"
"I was thinking about my phone number."
"Close your eyes and open your mouth."
"It looks like that is the case."
"Think carefully about what you do."
"I could tell you some great stories."
"I choose not to."
"This is how the Savior comes."
"Red sky in the morning alerts the sailor."
"He's a former CIA man."
"Close your eyes and wet your lips."
"She's Red Dog, and this is Beaver."
"Let her see who her uncle is."
"I see what I want."
"It's true that she is pretty."
"As long as we treat them like adults."
"No, that's not the question."
"Are he and his wife going to divorce?"
"It's the shots from last night."
"You have a mother, remember?"
"I wanted to spend time with you."
"They will be our army."
"Our army, our economy must be strong."
"Someone must know something."
"No, I can't tonight."
"I see her every two weeks."
"His family are all snitches."
"Are you telling me it's you?"
"It's time for things to change."
"He's with a great girl, Alabama."
"I have nothing else left."
"Everyone needs love."
"I really wanted to see them."
"Your father was very proud of you."
"Hey, this is what's going to happen."
"I had a lot of fun with you."
"The friend I told you about."
"I am crazy with admiration for you."
"Don't thank me all at once."
"Can we have a coffee in there?"
"He asked for a girl for you."
"You've done a lot of things together."
"Luckily there is this plant."
"What was he going to do?"
"No, the tone is not there."
"I wondered the same thing."
"He must have gone to the right."
"I'll come say goodnight to you later."
"Do you really want me to go?"
"I'm doing you a favor, my friend."
"What am I going to say to him?"
"You have to see the big picture."
"His crosses were better than his speeches."
"That was all I had."
"Judas, the Master speaks to you, answer him."
"I'll make short work of it."
"You owe it to yourself."
"Listen, I'm going to tell you something."
"Give them tokens, on my account."
"We take our things and leave."
"You call that being cool?"
"According to my mother, it's all him."
"I have what he needs."
"What do you do to them?"
"I won't give you that pleasure."
"You just have to tell him."
"At least you'd be away from here."
"You're going to be late for class."
"This is how I survive."
"Do you think you're so good?"
"You heard, his name is Tyler."
"The real driver is floating in a sewer."
"People think I never go out."
"I have a beautiful and wonderful wife."
"Do it, if you're so smart."
"That's all you're good for."
"This is a good place to start."
"I love you and I miss you."
"Do you understand what this means?"
"You know, it's practically my team."
"Let's stay here, among ourselves, in privacy."
"When do I see you?"
"She proves that the story is true."
"I think she likes him."
"What did he make you do?"
"I thought we talked about it."
"I wonder what's happening to him."
"I bought it for my wife."
"It's your turn to shine."
"Did you find anything useful?"
"You know why I have to face him."
"If you have sheep, give them away."
"Do you want me to go with you?"
"I will stay with you all night."
"I thought you might like this."
"I'm only happy like that."
"On the way out, we'll buy two more."
"And you will be able to defeat the king."
"Do you think I wanted this?"
"That's what I pray for."
"You have never been to Singapore."
"Should we prepare for their launch, General?"
"Oh, I see what it is."
"What is your husband's first name?"
"I thought I was doing God's will."
"I'll tell you anyway."
"Since we've known each other for so long."
"I would have liked to be born the daughter of a samurai."
"That was very kind of him."
"I have to tell someone."
"Imagine that this line represents time."
"Welcome to your first flight lesson."
"Who would want to live in a place like this?"
"I know this because Tyler knows this."
"The peasants are the real winners."
"The way he looks at you, or not."
"Just looking at her exhausts me."
"There's a word on the TV."
"You have turned the city against him."
"Do you think I can do it?"
"The hardest part is the looks."
"He finds himself covered in black ink."
"They are heading towards another point."
"Electricity within everyone's reach."
"I completely agree with you."
"It was a pleasure talking to you."
"It's two hours from here."
"Forced marriages are sometimes the best."
"And what an honor to get this far."
"You are doing it."
"What does it have to do with it?"
"Do you have any idea of its purpose?"
"Was there anyone who mattered?"
"No, I'm reading."
"I asked for a high-class chili."
"One of them opens this door."
"You have a way with words."
"This is what it will do to him."
"Anywhere, as fast as possible."
"I know what she did."
"I think he already knows that."
"You brown it, without it sticking."
"What the hell are you doing, Solomon?"
"I can, but not that close."
"I want to see the place as I pass by."
"Of course we have the right."
"What could he do?"
"Do I have time to change?"
"I needed to hear your voice."
"I better get to class."
"That was five months ago."
"Do you want a piece of my pie?"
"You're going to like this tiger, man."
"We have all night ahead of us."
"We have a question for you."
"The fresh air does me good."
"I am so happy to meet you."
"He is a man like any other."
"The one you didn't want to open the door to?"
"Everything is possible thanks to technology."
"He knew everything about everyone."
"No one will change your mind."
"And I have Mr. Shadow on the line."
"I am a friend of Bobby Singer."
"No, he is not in a condition."
"How did you learn to do that?"
"Look what's happening to your friend."
"You're the one who parked it."
"I'm going to my office to get ready."
"Are these the only ones you see?"
"What do you think of my little philosophy?"
"You are the geisha of my life."
"What if I don't have one?"
"That he's some kind of vampire?"
"You just have to come and see."
"So you are the king of the Jews?"
"I told you she would stay."
"What do you have to say about that?"
"What are we going to do to my teeth?"
"What did we do last night?"
"But everything is back to normal."
"I live around the corner."
"You have something on your cheek."
"It is against God's will."
"That's what I had to do."
"I was talking to you."
"No, you didn't say it."
"You know that Arabs are barbarians."
"It's a man's life."
"Do you think I did that?"
"Come on, I need to talk to you."
"Commander Lawrence will campaign this winter."
"Come back with me, please."
"Let's do what we do best."
"They seem to be heading towards the morgue."
"She knows exactly where the stones are."
"She didn't do anything at all."
"Because I've already done it."
"Give me the keys to my car."
"I would have told them where you are."
"You risked your life for me."
"It's about robbing a bookmaker."
"Lots of people here can do it."
"I like the way this is going."
"Kathy is feeling a bit pissed off right now."
"Can we do this?"
"You must have heard about me."
"The Don is proud of you too."
"There is always room."
"Four samurai to guard each side."
"I'm paid to enforce it."
"I might have a better idea."
"But it's worth a try."
"For me, it's the most beautiful."
"What if she doesn't love me?"
"I need a ride."
"No one born of woman will reach Macbeth."
"She may have changed her mind."
"I want it done right."
"I am interested in other subjects."
"I'll tell you everything when I get back."
"You and your wife will be fine there."
"What if there is nothing?"
"He's the love of his life."
"I'm just keeping the king's peace."
"I did my part of the bargain."
"How about we have a little fun?"
"Do you understand what I'm doing here?"
"What are you going to do with this money?"
"When did she tell you that?"
"There is something between them."
"You'd better remember that."
"Was there a wedding here?"
"I think we should listen to him."
"I forgot what it was."
"My father entrusted her to Doug."
"It's time to clean up."
"In summer, we even work at night."
"My colleagues and I are very excited."
"Do you ever dress like a woman?"
"This is all so new to me."
"There are plenty of other jobs."
"Well, that explains a lot."
"I'm leaving town for a few days."
"They think they won't come anymore."
"Why do you make me do this to you?"
"I put a simple sleeping pill in it."
"There were some good times."
"Have you studied the building plan?"
"You have a body, like everyone else."
"Do you think I'll go?"
"This is a portrait of James Monroe."
"This is a present for my son."
"Give me a chance to prove it."
"How long are you going to do this?"
"Later, people will say that about us."
"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror?"
"Look what's happening to your son."
"It's his word against yours."
"Do you have change for five cents?"
"Two of his teeth are dad's."
"No, I know no one by that name."
"Where was he last seen?"
"This meeting will have been a good thing."
"You let me take care of that."
"They reached the air shield."
"Answer the door and be polite."
"It ties you to your old life."
"That's what I tell him again."
"But that was just the beginning."
"You will hear from my lawyer."
"No, this is not my house."
"Are you sure you're not coming?"
"I would give everything I have."
"Good God, what's going on?"
"I had to go to the hospital."
"How do you put yourself in these situations?"
"No, I don't have children."
"I think of you every day."
"Do you have the keys to the apartment?"
"I guess I'll tell you."
"Tell him to call me urgently."
"I had to get out of there."
"Did you talk to his father too?"
"You will give the name of the first composer."
"I thought it was a game."
"As soon as I get back to base."
"People will think we love each other."
"I wanted to talk to you about something else."
"A bit like you with women."
"I have exactly what I need."
"I am an American, a refugee in Sicily."
"It's a big day for you."
"I have the right to defend myself."
"Let me talk to this guy."
"The second part, I agree."
"I understand why you did it."
"How do I know you're cops?"
"I don't think we know each other."
"What do you do with your Arab friends?"
"I grow it in my window."
"That's the word you're looking for."
"When needed, he is fast."
"What happened to your eyes?"
"Tell him I need to talk to him."
"I settle the family accounts."
"The director is waiting for you in his office."
"Safe shots, clear background."
"I'll give you money to leave."
"It will take an hour."
"She's the boss's wife, see?"
"I didn't take part in it."
"I have to go to the bookmaker."
"When did he tell you that?"
"Imagine that I suspected it."
"No, I didn't go."
"Listen, I know how you feel."
"Is it still far away, at the Russian?"
"No, I'm telling you what it is."
"They've been in there since last night."
"Are you sure you can stabilize the fusion?"
"I have an appointment with my editor."
"Do you like the effect it has?"
"What world do you live in, what world?"
"What's stopping me?"
"We have three big days ahead of us."
"Give it to someone else."
"No, I'm not finished yet."
"I think he's a cop."
"You've always been straight with me."
"Not a king like you, lord."
"It's good to have friends."
"That's where the stars go."
"We'll see about finances later."
"By the way, who were you dancing with?"
"He wants to train you for command."
"I'll take care of your figure."
"Among ourselves, we called each other 'friends'."
"The governor will see you at his leisure."
"And those night outs with the suitcase?"
"You are a god among insects."
"These kids are here for a while."
"Or declare all-out war on them?"
"I would do it if I knew him."
"I brought you some soup."
"Imagine what power we would have together."
"I would like to know what that means."
"Do we have a plan?"
"You know what I saw?"
"She kicked me out."
"Your father also flouted the rules."
"How will he do it?"
"I want to be in your arms too."
"We didn't give him any publicity."
"I asked him to come with me."
"Is this your first time in Japan?"
"You must return to the child."
"The noise might attract someone."
"Now we will return to Black Rock."
"Can't you read my mind?"
"He came here to have fun."
"You can go if you want."
"I want her to stay with me."
"Did you take him for a rabbit?"
"And I want you to be happy."
"The little one behind you is Mouse."
"I can pick some up from your place."
"You could have lived a little longer."
"Have I ever asked you for a favor?"
"I've been good all day."
"Is there one for that?"
"Put on something elegant quickly."
"I know that's how it is."
"I miss you and I love you."
"No, it's not a dream."
"Did you give him new cards?"
"You're cuter than I thought."
"You don't want me to wait?"
"He will have to do this in two places."
"I said I would try."
"What if he asks where you are?"
"Is it safe to let her go?"
"Life is God's choice."
"I need you to believe me."
"What did you do with my father?"
"I'll see how it goes."
"What is there to add?"
"I am absolutely certain of it."
"Turn around and go away."
"I'm coming from the mailbox."
"Can you tell me where he is?"
"I have a son and a daughter."
"Did you tell him where we were?"
"Who needs us in Moscow?"
"I'll get a glass of water."
"No, I have what it takes."
"Large capital and few men."
"Few people have a destiny, Lawrence."
"I know what she means."
"And all's well that ends well."
"Two bulls or six, it's the same."
"I knew what that meant."
"It has to look real."
"What do we do to him?"
"It's not nearly that simple."
"I don't want her to come."
"You're not a cop, are you?"
"We will find common ground."
"Let's see if the referee will count it."
"Don't let anyone convince you otherwise."
"Tell me when it's time."
"How many times do I have to repeat myself?"
"It's time to go to work."
"Yet he is here, I assure you."
"You see, that's the thing."
"It's house policy."
"I'll call you tomorrow, you let me know."
"I'm telling you it's good."
"What are you singing to him?"
"Here are my three meals, smart guy."
"He reminded me of you."
"I told you to get dressed."
"But what are you waiting for?"
"I feel sorry for you."
"For your own good, give up your idea."
"I demand to know who you are."
"So, what did you want to talk to me about?"
"As rare as the Manhattan phone book."
"The man with the cabbage head."
"Do your parents know where you are?"
"That's what I used to do."
"When did you start smoking?"
"I wanted to thank you for recording."
"Yes, if he gets his way."
"You owe him a ton of money."
"Is this the one?"
"Tell her you're going to take her out."
"He's almost part of the family."
"Fighting is teamwork."
"You will never be the same again."
"Are we sure this is true?"
"She always has a shovel around there."
"These are the house rules."
"Please, time is running out."
"Everything your body needs."
"We will call you before H-hour."
"I was the happiest kid."
"Sorry it's under these circumstances."
"You didn't come by camel?"
"Go ahead, have a drink, have fun."
"It made me think of us."
"So far, I've been having a good day."
"Please don't do it again."
"Because you could really use it."
"The Don is half retired."
"She's here because of you."
"I have it on the big screen."
"Men will be backstage with Tony."
"She wasn't home."
"I still feel his presence in me."
"Eat this, it feels so good."
"You shot him in the back."
"Robinson didn't tell us."
"Tell me what you're going to do."
"He had a fight with your husband."
"You saw how he looked at her."
"I think I've said it all."
"I thought you might like that."
"Gather some of your best assassins."
"But what are you looking at?"
"You have the man for the job."
"I think he doesn't know anything."
"What do you think he's playing at?"
"And where does it happen for me?"
"You feel good, I'm happy."
"He taught me."
"Did I do the right thing?"
"It didn't go as planned."
"It's the living room on your right."
"Do you want to stay here all night?"
"Let her wear what she wants."
"Do you have a license for this kid?"
"Introducing the legendary Denny Z."
"At the entrance to the afterlife."
"We thought he was our friend."
"We'll see each other then."
"What do you see when you look at me?"
"They should be ready in a few years."
"Let me hug you."
"The toilets are at the end of the corridor."
"Catherine is very sweet and very kind."
"I had to get your attention."
"Did the cat eat your tongue?"
"What can it do?"
"What am I going to tell?"
"I promised my mother."
"Who said I was?"
"Water down your wine."
"It will be settled in no time."
"There's a package for you."
"I'm here for one reason."
"Is it just about sex?"
"He knows what it's about."
"Is this what communication means to you?"
"If you had a job, you would understand."
"What else is 'out of the zone'?"
"I have things well in hand."
"Who is Lowell's pride now?"
"There is a very simple explanation."
"So, what does it look like?"
"What am I saying here?"
"I already told you yesterday."
"He tells you to stir the sauce."
"You promised to stay close by."
"He has to get out of this."
"One life in exchange for another."
"I catch him and release him."
"Who's standing next to me?"
"I just need to be told when."
"Let us pray that this never happens."
"Because it's worth it."
"You're the one who horrifies me."
"But where have you been for so long?"
"You're the one who's going to do it."
"I put the cat next to it."
"Where are my mother and sister?"
"If you want it, it's there."
"It's nice of you to visit us."
"Will we ever manage to get back?"
"They don't need that."
"The most surprising knockout ever seen."
"Ambrose is with a guy at the bar."
"I swear I don't know anything."
"Do you think I have a microphone?"
"Do you know that I liked him?"
"He wants us to move the island."
"I've spent my whole life here."
"I have a gift for you too."
"There is an opportunity to be seized."
"I want to have a baby with you."
"I know you don't want to."
"And I'm so proud of you."
"What else do you know about me?"
"You already asked me this question."
"I have to go to America for three months."
"I wonder what's happening to her."
"It's not: 'Where is he?'"
"It is the cocoon of an insect."
"It is four floors underground."
"So what would you do?"
"As if he was going to tell me."
"What's wrong with you, huh?"
"I have a proposition for my father."
"But I have something to say."
"Once famous, he left you."
"I was wondering where you had gone."
"You're on TV again."
"Is my father here?"
"Did you put it under the bed?"
"The difference between us and machines."
"I have an organization behind me."
"The only thing that is pure, clean."
"Everyone wanted to please him."
"Tell me what to say."
"She knows what she did."
"Glad you remember me."
"I waited outside all night."
"Haven't seen it yet?"
"Tony, what's going on?"
"Can we talk about this another time?"
"No need for the governor's reward."
"With anyone, anywhere."
"Relax, we'll take care of the rest."
"We have everything we want."
"I saw her running out."
"That's right, he makes underwear."
"I'm just a utility, right?"
"It was self-defense, right?"
"He said I could come?"
"I think I can do that."
"What does she want to prove?"
"I was on the news for three minutes."
"I found it in the parking lot."
"You're the one who's naive, aren't you?"
"Someone got shot."
"He'll be here in half an hour."
"Do you know what she took?"
"No, we don't need it."
"Who are you to give advice?"
"Put the scarecrow near that tree."
"It's getting more and more interesting."
"We will have the opportunity to see each other again."
"I wanted to say I'm sorry."
"Or soar high in the clouds."
"I thought we would make it."
"And I know you will."
"They are found in the computer system."
"I will stay awake to prevent him."
"There are people here tonight."
"A pretty young woman to excite him."
"I love conversations that start like this."
"Years and years of practice."
"Yes my love, you come before God."
"Do you want to go out tonight?"
"I never promised you anything."
"That's all she wants."
"It was never the right time."
"I like you too, my chick."
"I grew up in a small town."
"I've been investigating him for three years."
"It went better than expected."
"You're the one who should go."
"She was making great progress, and that was it."
"Okay, I got it, I got it."
"It was my mother's idea."
"I don't have much to say."
"Except they did that in America."
"Don't you want to eat something?"
"I've heard of this before."
"I helped build these cells."
"It's for the Mascot Contest."
"Check, he just turned due north."
"It's time you knew."
"It's the past, it's far away."
"How long do you have?"
"And I have a surprise for you."
"He knows I betrayed him."
"Need freedom, you know who to vote for."
"Tell your men to stand down."
"This may be good news."
"Tell me you have his location."
"Is this how you work?"
"It's like this every morning."
"They don't answer our calls."
"If you get it right, you'll be free."
"But he's just a kid."
"I remember you very well."
"She has a little crisis at times."
"I will do everything to find him."
"I say what the other would say?"
"Do you think it's a male?"
"Is there anything to do?"
"He was twice the size of the other one."
"Do you want us to get out of here?"
"Only one guy can decide for you."
"It looks like some kind of padlock."
"That's good, eat your candy."
"Are you going to force me to do it?"
"I was paid to be there."
"There's someone down there."
"Don't I get a kiss?"
"But I have nothing better."
"It's time to close the door."
"First the stone, then the doctor."
"I just met the good fairy."
"You're right, we had an agreement."
"He is leaving us."
"You will see the station right away."
"This is my wife and daughter."
"You should not read this book."
"She didn't say goodbye."
"I have one in my bag."
"I need to turn the page."
"And you, are you okay?"
"Who has a message for Germany?"
"What was he doing in the common room?"
"It's the same as yours."
"Two or three years ago."
"Is this the second password?"
"Ed Miller was a good friend of mine."
"I have a lot of work to finish."
"I sent out tons of resumes."
"You deserve each other."
"We're treating you, and you're feeling better."
"Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure."
"Don't you remember us?"
"Last month you said two weeks."
"The doctor who was there last night?"
"You have blue eyes, so do I."
"This is the moment you've all been waiting for."
"You will need to watch the volume button."
"I asked everyone."
"Go to the window on your left."
"But wasn't that the question?"
"You put him back in his place."
"And what was the lesson of the day?"
"That's what we wanted, right?"
"I thought I was fighting to be champion."
"It is an honor and a pleasure."
"Think about what they put in it."
"Maybe they don't like humans."
"He knows, he wants to talk, I buy."
"Are you a businessman or a journalist?"
"He wants us to get back together."
"I told him to be careful."
"Please let me in."
"How many women have you slept with?"
"I have a good diet book."
"I'll show you on the map."
"How could I let this happen?"
"No reason not to."
"My friends are not murderers."
"I threw it out into the street."
"What changed him?"
"Lord, shine your light upon us."
"Blue is when you're pregnant."
"I took her in my arms."
"If it's not the smoker."
"Do you want to watch the World Cup?"
"I hope you will be happy here."
"I welcomed you into this world."
"Saturday was brides' night."
"They don't know what they want."
"But someone was there this morning."
"Why are you so good to me?"
"But I wanted to tell you something."
"So write that down in your diary."
"Your god chooses to remain silent."
"I'm already happy to be here."
"I can taste them in my mouth."
"How long have you had this?"
"I'll give you a call."
"She keeps calling me."
"I told him, he checks everything."
"What's going on, son?"
"I know you're still here."
"It must be one of them."
"My agent says it's important."
"Bring it to me, along with the device."
"Have you noticed what I'm doing?"
"There are weapons everywhere here."
"We'll see that when I see you."
"You only think about your own interests."
"I play in the big leagues."
"Thank you for taking care of her."
"And the day you learn them?"
"I can make everything go back to the way it was."
"I was right next to him."
"How are you doing up there?"
"I asked you to sit down."
"I know she did."
"Let's look through the looking glass."
"No, but she called me Brad."
"You reminded me of him."
"You need to sign for the owners."
"That's the way things are."
"Did your mother tell you about me?"
"Do you serve those who come without a maid?"
"She looks very good to me."
"Thanks, but I'll drink it here."
"Others fight for His cause."
"But it's really good."
"What was this little conversation leading to?"
"I'm here to set the record straight."
"I forgot what I was saying."
"They have been identified, that's for sure."
"It was the limelight."
"It's a slaughterhouse in itself."
"You took a bullet for me."
"It was beyond my strength."
"I just like him, that's all."
"I always had other desires."
"You are in the house of God."
"Look, I was told to cooperate."
"But it's you I love."
"Am I going to have to drink this hot coffee?"
"I should be paid to watch this."
"I think that's a good sign."
"I've never seen her like this."
"Honey, where are you going?"
"I have information on Hannibal Lecter."
"There were just the two of us."
"I have to use the bathroom."
"So what does it give?"
"Professor, what is this?"
"You lure him with food."
"You should come to my house for a few weeks."
"What are you doing to yourself?"
"She is the most beautiful in the world."
"People made big sacrifices."
"By the Lord and His Almighty Power."
"He had a lot of change on him."
"But at least from there you will see."
"And that's what we will do."
"Meet at the hangar area."
"Such was the price of your crown."
"Do you know where I can find some?"
"Did you put this?"
"Maybe I'll sell shoes."
"Is it normal for him to be here?"
"That's because he is."
"She is not at her desk."
"You're no better than him."
"Your green light for a special operation."
"I don't think he's coming back."
"I don't want another girl."
"I'm just helping out."
"I think I'll say yes."
"I can't even talk to you."
"You're not Rosebud?"
"Everything in my power."
"Hit the head, but work the body."
"Is there any mail for me?"
"I had to become someone else."
"He's outside changing the oil."
"If you're right about the guns."
"I like that you're here."
"No other man can touch her."
"Basically, they see things differently."
"Everything related to the game."
"I wonder what he looks like."
"I remembered something."
"You have people under your responsibility."
"This salt comes from the Indian Ocean."
"There must be a freight elevator."
"I had two glasses of wine."
"As if time had stopped."
"I am the last of my kind."
"Time to kiss those sweet handcuffs."
"And when were you going to tell me?"
"We need to talk in private."
"Either one is fine with me."
"Where we found the black book."
"I think it's best to go home."
"They can say whatever they want."
"Yes, that's it, that's it."
"But he's a good, honest guy."
"Tell me what you're doing here."
"It's like I won."
"I knew it from the start."
"I found it in his jacket."
"But our species have a common ancestor."
"See you tomorrow at school."
"Do you like England and Arabia?"
"You always react the same way."
"A very curious performance from Micky Ward."
"That's what I know how to do."
"As if I've heard it before."
"Show them what we are capable of."
"Have you seen Lawrence since he returned?"
"We are aware of the situation."
"By the end of the week."
"Billy, it's the house that treats."
"His voice was frighteningly true."
"What do we do there?"
"They left for the weekend."
"She didn't want to talk to me."
"You go into the field with Crawford."
"But you have to listen to me."
"I heard about Life magazine."
"I have a patient nearby."
"Let's move on to analyzing this simulation."
"Do you have a second to spare?"
"You need stitches."
"Your captains will be your aides-de-camp."
"Do you have something to show me?"
"Who's going to take care of you, darling?"
"Maybe it's not so bad."
"Arabia is part of his empire."
"Have you never flown before?"
"No one knows how you did it."
"He lives across the street from me."
"I was a friend of your dad."
"Because she made a choice."
"What do you think it does to me?"
"That is, a certain number."
"Because you seemed nice."
"Let him do what he wants."
"It will take him more than six weeks."
"What have you done in your life?"
"What do we do, Red?"
"She can drink here whenever she wants."
"I was told about the prescription."
"Who wants to play bridge after dinner?"
"It did me a world of good."
"I had nothing to say to him."
"That was nine centuries ago."
"And there we will talk about your future."
"I have my whole life ahead of me."
"Show me what you ate."
"She opens her eyes out of pure reflex."
"I've always been in love with you."
"The generator will start."
"What did she say about me?"
"You only had one thing to do."
"Customs had a record of him."
"It better be me."
"Did you bring the plastic men?"
"I was just beginning to have fun."
"I could have had class."
"Maybe we should say a prayer?"
"Thank you so much for coming tonight."
"Since I came back from the future."
"He said he knew you."
"A topic of interest between pubs."
"I'll tell you in a minute."
"I am a friend of your son."
"Where are we going, swimming?"
"Your friendship can send you underground."
"Do you want to train with your brother?"
"I saw them with my own eyes."
"He is a very tough young man."
"She has her head screwed on."
"I don't think we can."
"It's nice of you to visit me."
"Let's go, we'll be there at dawn."
"I know just the guy."
"Did he follow me?"
"Everyone has a different name."
"To show him a good time."
"You want to play this with me."
"I have never taken drugs."
"I've got my eye on you, kid."
"You look good, your eyes are clear."
"Tell him what I said."
"Your son, the flesh of your flesh."
"I would like to write a feature article."
"You wanted to have fun last night."
"I am here as a friend."
"A man needs a name."
"Let me in, please."
"Maybe we got rid of it."
"I sent them before your wife."
"I helped him, that's all."
"Where is the nearest unit?"
"I told you, Dad."
"Is it me or is it hot?"
"We were the ones who wanted one."
"A price has been put on our heads."
"When she's done, take her out."
"Would you like to repeat your statement to us?"
"It's you I'm thinking of."
"That's what we were talking about."
"Oh, he was a very handsome boy."
"Have you read one of my books?"
"Curfew time has passed."
"That's for me to say."
"She wasn't like this before."
"What if someone saw you?"
"You can't do that to them."
"We see each other from time to time."
"Is this someone we know?"
"Grab your bags and form ranks."
"You don't owe me an apology."
"You're right, you're always right."
"I could go take a closer look."
"I think you'll be fine here."
"We all have a face to hide."
"I'm sure he'll score."
"You are the father of the nation."
"There's something else that's bothering me."
"He knows what he did."
"Dad said it."
"From the end of Return of the Jedi."
"Is there a way, doctor?"
"Did you tell them who you were?"
"You just stood there staring at me."
"Maybe I'll have one one day."
"Can't you wait a little?"
"Can I borrow it for a moment?"
"This is a portrait of his father."
"The password for the evening?"
"She changes, and we go out together."
"Parking is prohibited here."
"I would like to spend the nights with her."
"All this to enrich other families."
"He went to a lot of trouble."
"Maybe I'm out of it."
"I had one once."
"The most important thing is to stay calm."
"I have more in reserve."
"Is that what betrayed me?"
"I thought about you all the time."
"She was a wonderful woman, so beautiful."
"She can turn me into a real boy."
"Don't give him anything from your plate."
"What happens to pregnant women?"
"A visit that never took place."
"This is an important evening for us."
"They have been trying for many years."
"I have just what I need."
"I have never seen you before."
"Do you know where the Blue Fairy lives?"
"It is an honor and a privilege."
"Did she say anything to you?"
"It would be nice if it were true."
"You're almost one of us."
"A human rights lawyer."
"There is no list."
"I'm going to see Caitlin at the hospital."
"You will be the first to know."
"But keep your real name secret."
"You know I need it."
"I'm the one with the money."
"Who has ever done chemistry?"
"It's so good to meet you."
"They went to dinner at a cabaret."
"I'll be there as soon as I'm done."
"He is my mother's father."
"You have a bright future ahead of you."
"I want to speak to Mr. Edward Wilson."
"The year is almost over, Brighton."
"You understand what could happen, right?"
"What are you doing on Saturday?"
"I found this in the garage."
"What will I say to my next sources?"
"Did you say I was good?"
"You didn't make love?"
"Can I have the password?"
"This is the one I came for."
"Now tell me who is behind this."
"I want you to do your job."
"I don't want an incident."
"My wife is giving birth."
"I need a new job."
"What does he have to gain from it?"
"I'm sure he can pay."
"I let myself be guided by my conscience."
"We have the family's agreement."
"Mom, what's wrong with you?"
"I want to do something for her."
"As far back as I can remember."
"That's where you have to look."
"No one else did it."
"What won't work?"
"What are we telling each other?"
"Make bacon or ham out of it."
"Will we finish what we started?"
"Do you still have feelings for her?"
"I thought I was finished."
"Are you the only one living there?"
"You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday."
"No, it's just us."
"Yes, that's what I believe."
"And that a third goes beyond this intersection."
"You have to find someone else."
"Would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
"Tomorrow is a long day of driving."
"In that case, I'll go."
"Shall I tell you about my day at the office?"
"I do what she loved to do."
"You are the first of your kind."
"But he never said anything."
"It's my uncle's birthday."
"Even if it's not true."
"I'll take care of that later."
"We have other fish to fry."
"I have something else to talk to you about."
"Yes, that's what you say."
"You see me in a vendetta mood."
"What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?"
"This is the state of Mississippi, here."
"You said you wanted to talk."
"Take the pictures, leave me the titles."
"Red is the color of the gods."
"What will we do with you?"
"May the Force be with you, Master."
"I am the one who called you."
"I feel like I'm going to like it."
"What happened to my car?"
"I released the oxygen masks."
"Yeah, what's going on?"
"I spent my life in America."
"You should get your hair cut."
"The English are hungry for wide open spaces."
"You just have to follow me."
"Was it presented to you like that?"
"Any idea what it was?"
"Not something you can program."
"I know what you are capable of."
"He said it was you."
"I'll get it back to you as soon as possible."
"This will be the music of battle."
"It's my turn to speak."
"I loved you right away."
"It's just for a little while."
"She reminds me a lot of you."
"It's early for cartoons."
"Thank you for coming to tell me."
"No, that's not the one."
"You put the money here first."
"I use it every day."
"I had my face redone."
"It helps me to have a goal."
"We've always needed you."
"I want us to make love."
"That's all he is."
"Do you believe in Jesus Christ, Our Lord?"
"I have to go to the store."
"I will not answer any more questions."
"I have control of the situation."
"You-Know-Who to return to power."
"I had something to tell you."
"Then she had other guys."
"You should come and wish him a good trip."
"You need to get some fresh air."
"I'll call you when I get there."
"I have to say goodnight to the little ones."
"I'm going to pull myself together and make an effort."
"I move things with my brain."
"Thank you for saving our lives."
"Maybe you should see a doctor."
"Haven't you heard the radio?"
"She's amazing, isn't she?"
"What would we do with it?"
"That was the first thing to do."
"I want to get this thing over with."
"It's a piece of cake, you're relaxed."
"For example, the origin of these signals."
"You only think of yourself."
"I think I know what he's looking for."
"My eldest son is in sales."
"Would you like another glass of wine?"
"You'd better go then."
"Now it's your little friends' turn."
"It was his decision, not mine."
"There is more to life."
"That's all he has left."
"You want to know what I have?"
"It's time to tell me everything."
"Give my compliments to your master."
"It's time to shine again."
"You could at least hide the bottle."
"You knew exactly what you were doing."
"Just after a nice right from Ward."
"Was it enough to face Sugar Ray?"
"Do you hear the noise of that mill?"
"I know what you have to do."
"I'm at my summer camp."
"It's a bit the same thing."
"Love is stronger than anything."
"My saliva feels like cotton wool."
"This is the end of our show."
"Maybe this is a sign."
"That's what the sign says."
"Do you believe that informing changes things?"
"I thought you might like to know."
"I can make a few calls."
"I love him with all my heart."
"You taught me a valuable lesson."
"I'm going to stay here in this shack."
"I'll buy you dinner in town."
"We'll bring him home."
"For me, this game is a competition."
"Do you want to change the subject?"
"Your sister left the office on Friday."
"I already told you, no."
"He needs to know that too."
"As long as he is healthy."
"I saw a bar over there."
"That's what brothers do."
"It will be because I want it."
"Let's go before the Germans arrive."
"It's like being there."
"Grab your stuff and let's go."
"Have you ever been with a girl?"
"Right in the real world, right?"
"Call a truce for lunch."
"He knows it, he won't talk."
"I shot him in the head."
"Is there a back door?"
"I knew it would come to this."
"Did you set this up?"
"I wonder if that's true."
"You mean he's here?"
"This is exactly what you wanted."
"He has never been happier."
"What happened to the ball?"
"You didn't say much."
"Christ does not live in them."
"Listen, something happened."
"It's a beautiful smile contest."
"There's something down there."
"Because it means something."
"Your newspaper has had a lot of influence."
"Something is happening between us."
"Would you please come down and talk to me?"
"What if he wasn't?"
"Maybe it's a better name."
"Not if you designed the place."
"She said she was sorry."
"I am happy where I am."
"I have exactly what you want."
"I was just calling you."
"How long did it stay attached?"
"But because it didn't exist."
"He's their pianist right now."
"Maybe, if I saw the file."
"Little man-boy with beady eyes."
"If you want it, it will be there."
"I think it's the opposite."
"Have you researched me?"
"He has to get into her."
"Can't you drive any faster?"
"I want to talk to you about your tape."
"Let's talk about what happened."
"I think I have the answer."
"What happened to the house?"
"That's what I wanted to see."
"You know exactly what it is."
"In accordance with the pioneer code."
"A man rises to the foreground."
"I just want to go on the show."
"I've worked in a lot of bars."
"Everything I ever wanted."
"Have you lived here all your life?"
"Nor why the birds no longer sing."
"I would do a few more hours."
"That's what she needs."
"And there are others."
"I'll put you back in your place."
"Wait. I'll be there in a second."
"I have friends in the industry."
"He was in business with my father."
"I discovered it myself."
"I don't trust him at all."
"For the first time in his life."
"This is the man you are looking for."
"You could have done it yourself."
"I even married a vampire woman."
"I carried the baby up the stairs."
"I saw something inexplicable."
"There may be a reason."
"The river is straight east."
"She risked her life for me."
"It takes two to catch Jesse."
"I thought it was for tomorrow."
"This one there, and this one here."
"We'll take care of you later."
"Just for who you are."
"I must prepare for prayer."
"You are the one who will listen to me."
"You must be good and go to bed."
"Of course I want to marry you."
"Did you want to give me a little kiss?"
"She is my father's wife."
"I never really loved you."
"And I will protect you instead of him."
"Have you talked to your father about this?"
"I saw your bank statement."
"The second act is called 'the effect'."
"That's the understatement of the year."
"What do you want us to do with it?"
"You'll see them again, I promise."
"Do what your mother said."
"Body and mind are one."
"It's just habit, that's all."
"I feel sorry for them."
"He knew what was going on there."
"I have these hallucinations and visions."
"A flash in a copper conductor."
"This part of my life is over."
"It's your turn to go."
"No, how dare you even think that?"
"It's up to her to do it."
"There are some all the time."
"Try the second one from the top."
"You didn't mention Bob."
"I prepare them and you drink them."
"But you know you love it."
"Two sides of the same coin."
"You weren't answering my calls."
"There is a door over there."
"Your title entitles you to the throne."
"Please let us go."
"And the Great Eye is ever vigilant."
"I can never go home."
"I was saving the place for you, Father."
"We need to get everyone out."
"No, I didn't talk to him."
"He will say the prayer in the garden."
"Now is the time to do it."
"I'm going to call our band that."
"He still has a bit of breath left."
"Yes, something happened."
"I should never have faced him."
"I knew you were going to do that."
"I told you I was working."
"The password, please?"
"I have an electric jet project."
"We did it for him."
"That's all he deserves."
"I get tired of repeating this sentence."
"What did he drink?"
"What will you do when it's all over?"
"I will change the color of your Fairy."
"I'm coming to see if everything is okay."
"Ask if he got the letter."
"They want to see what's going on."
"Please pay attention to the drawings."
"He puts it in his left pocket."
"Change your life, completely."
"I did everything by the book."
"Tell me what that means."
"I'm retiring next year."
"That was fifteen years ago."
"No one can change their destiny now."
"Power is dropping across the entire network."
"You have to trap them in a subtle way."
"Do you know you are under oath?"
"I took what I wanted."
"Do you want some too, kiddo?"
"So we'll have to try something else."
"I have him in my sights."
"I'm done with men."
"You don't sound sure."
"I know boys your age."
"Do you want coffee or something else?"
"He had to go shopping."
"You're the one who said 'king'."
"Can I know what you're doing?"
"There you are, working for Tobacco."
"I thought it would never end."
"It's a great relief for me."
"Who's going to put a stop to this, Senator?"
"It will be just like old times."
"She said I could stay."
"It is time for us to act."
"I also cover sensitive issues there."
"I want to talk to you about it in person."
"Tell me you have something else."
"This is where it happened."
"I spoke with accounting yesterday."
"That's all you get."
"One of my former bodyguards."
"I thought we trusted each other."
"And who does their work there?"
"It's my sister's wedding."
"I feel a question of form coming."
"Finally, I was the one who spoke."
"We must bring him home."
"Stick your chest out by raising your arms."
"It's his way of expressing himself."
"Maybe that's all it is."
"Did you spend the whole night there?"
"You weren't serious last night?"
"I'm sure it's her."
"Did you throw the towel on the floor?"
"Who do you think did this?"
"I decided it."
"I did it for the money."
"What interests you so much?"
"I think it's his hand."
"Is that how you answer?"
"Please, let's find an agreement."
"She looks like she's having fun."
"Angel says it's time."
"No rush, take her to a psychiatrist."
"As if there was any logic."
"I just want to hear you say it."
"Did you see or hear anyone?"
"I have that effect on people."
"Where do we come from?"
"I am the love of his life."
"What distracted you?"
"Even if you are already very beautiful."
"I said goodbye to Lydia."
"Believe me, it's not fun."
"Circle around the card reader."
"Kyle, what are you doing?"
"I told you to come here."
"The future would be so simple and beautiful."
"Did they give you new teeth?"
"She must have been wearing them before I was born."
"Well, I'll tell you."
"How could I not be?"
"You can see that it's closed."
"I am fully aware of that."
"A friend's surveillance company."
"Was this helpful?"
"How do you know what is feasible?"
"It might snow."
"This is what I offer you."
"I saw you in your works."
"Take a tie so we can come in."
"The first part is called 'the pact'."
"But I was sure of his affection."
"The crew wishes you a safe journey."
"It's my turn to introduce you."
"It's not mine either."
"I think you are unaware of its extent."
"When do they have your recruitment method?"
"Come inside, or you'll feel my hand."
"I try to think of something else."
"Actually I draw all the time."
"I put you on the list."
"Go play in your room for a while."
"You still don't understand, do you?"
"They just want some food."
"You must have Jedi reflexes."
"I therefore pronounce you husband and wife."
"What do you do when it wakes you up?"
"Now he has me by the throat."
"I bet he hits a mine."
"Take all the time you want."
"But what if I don't succeed?"
"Maybe I'm imagining things."
"It's my only reason for living."
"You can go whenever you want."
"Wouldn't he be in love with you?"
"You just show up at my house like that?"
"Did you say you wanted to stay?"
"We'll see what his chances are."
"We'll see what you're worth."
"You hid me there once."
"It's about my brother."
"But we don't need anything."
"That's what we decided."
"I said he was gone."
"I prefer to place my trust in him."
"I know he was your friend."
"I wondered where she had gone."
"The wind always comes from the west."
"I'll show you how much."
"Where do you want us to put them?"
"The device has very powerful headlights."
"Did you hear gunshots?"
"But I need a partner."
"He was the one who found it."
"That's all I hear."
"No need for that, it's quiet."
"The doctor says she can travel."
"You know things, I feel it."
"Do you want me to come see you?"
"Once you're gone, don't think about it anymore."
"I need to say something."
"No. I did it myself."
"She only has me in the world."
"You haven't told him anything yet?"
"Yes, but we have control here."
"Now everything has to do with God."
"I have to go to high school."
"I think I'll keep it."
"The last one was maybe less strong?"
"Lecter did it for fun."
"I heard a man's voice."
"I can't handle this right now."
"Who will we find to replace him?"
"Is that right, you fainted?"
"You know we can do it."
"Do you want to make me another one?"
"What's keeping us here?"
"Honey, I have to ask you."
"There will be three of us watching over you."
"With all due respect, I don't think so."
"So give me one of those."
"You can see it whenever you want."
"And it came to me like that."
"What are you doing again?"
"Do you think she's well kept?"
"The one who brings light, wisdom and kindness."
"I never meant for this to happen."
"A story tells what happens."
"You were always the strongest."
"What does that give us?"
"I have a sense of direction."
"Even more than you think."
"There is a passage above."
"He introduced me to everyone."
"This is the symbolic importance of the gesture."
"I know what you can do."
"Maybe it was about him."
"Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?"
"I know you're hiding something."
"I learned a lot from my father."
"What was on that badge?"
"One for me and one for you."
"It's a two-hour drive."
"I have the address you wanted."
"We'll talk about all that later."
"It's just like you said."
"I could do this all night."
"For the network, we all are."
"I need you for a second."
"Do you prefer a table, or the bar?"
"What is the purpose of all this?"
"I have a date with a girl."
"I have a knot in my stomach."
"God knows what she's capable of."
"No one was to hear what he was saying."
"Try to find your parents among them."
"I can't really talk to you."
"Have you tried the training program?"
"He says he did it."
"Do you want me to open the window?"
"What have you been doing all this time?"
"What about your daughter?"
"Supposedly to write a tourist guide."
"Did she say something about me?"
"Tonight, I'm the one treating you."
"If you live to be old, you will see her."
"What are we looking for then?"
"I have experienced many important moments."
"He wants my job, my girlfriend."
"A white shepherd with his black sheep."
"I have to be in order."
"I already consider you my sister."
"Do you know what I could do?"
"What exactly do you expect from me?"
"Because I can afford it."
"How dare you turn your back on me?"
"I'm sorry for the last time."
"Oh, that was a long time ago."
"No need to stand out."
"Not in this life, anyway."
"You gave me hope."
"Everything is about to change."
"You do what you are asked."
"What's up this time?"
"She must get that from her mother."
"Sugar Ray said to call him."
"You're the one I'm going to marry."
"We love water and the forest."
"What am I doing to you?"
"He remembered so many things."
"It's my stepfather's."
"Explain to me what happened."
"I don't think you can."
"I've already taken care of him."
"Isn't this noise over, Lin?"
"Do you think they spotted us?"
"What happened to your car?"
"I came to tell you the beginning."
"He was the one who discovered it."
"If anyone listened, they knew everything."
"And maybe memorize the right level."
"Did this thought cross your mind?"
"That is, everyone."
"It seems like they're talking about us."
"She was talking about a cute little guy."
"I'll make a deal with you."
"Do you have any news about my daughter?"
"I found this in my bag."
"My cars are in my wife's name."
"Dinner will be ready in five minutes."
"Do you remember that day?"
"A birthday present from my father."
"You thought I wouldn't come?"
"It was never very solid."
"We must renounce all moral sense?"
"But that's just my opinion."
"But he leaves the basketball court."
"But there is another reason."
"But the owner demands to be paid."
"I lived mostly with my uncle."
"There are laws against that."
"I want to push it to the end."
"Go buy yourself something nice."
"How much do you think it could bring in?"
"I found this in the kitchen."
"Based on his political beliefs."
"I thought you'd never call."
"I don't know anything about art."
"Can we see each other again?"
"Do you want to make a snowman?"
"It's like this all the time."
"Three games for the price of one."
"What does she like to do?"
"You have to stick to the plan."
"She doesn't have much time left."
"Please don't do anything."
"You will speak when asked."
"Is this how you see me?"
"I was hoping we were past that."
"What can I do for you, Mr. French?"
"The envelope is next week."
"I would like to live in another city."
"So it's simpler this way."
"You'll hear gunshots."
"I can just show you the door."
"I bought you a dishwasher."
"My son was one of a kind."
"Does he make you laugh?"
"The thing that goes with the fork."
"It has to stay that way."
"They know you are with me."
"Jesse looked at Bob with a melancholy look."
"Yes, I agree with you."
"Life has no meaning."
"I needed a change of scenery."
"I trusted my friends."
"The house where my father was born."
"Maybe he can't."
"Well, your son is an artist."
"Go to the nearest safe area."
"There may be a catch."
"I say he's popular."
"They want us to go with them."
"This is the one I rented."
"We do it twice as fast."
"If you have any questions, please ask."
"It only takes one voice."
"A visual, sound, but also spiritual dimension."
"Come to my mission, in San Carlos."
"I know how it is here."
"I will be forever grateful to you."
"It's called 'Lily's Ocean'."
"What do the workers say about our action?"
"Since when do you speak in that tone?"
"You really have to see this."
"They get along well, those two."
"Can I ask you about this?"
"I need a Japanese blade."
"That's what I was thinking about."
"Someone has to take care of him."
"Is all this under your shack?"
"This is the one I'm talking about."
"Cut his meat and the table shakes."
"Tell them I'll take care of it."
"I think I know how you feel."
"A member of the brotherhood, I imagine."
"I thought you saw it."
"You were a little disrespectful to him."
"I'll let you both talk."
"I've never had an orgasm."
"It came to me suddenly."
"But we want justice to be done."
"In two or three games, you'll be ready."
"You can do one thing for me."
"Randy, what are you doing?"
"How did the autopsy go?"
"That's what the letter says."
"Would you come back to him?"
"I changed, I adapted."
"My God, what happened to you?"
"I have new teeth and everything."
"I found this in front of my door."
"Would you excuse me for a minute?"
"Something is happening at the restaurant."
"We wanted something, we helped ourselves."
"There's something around here."
"I was sleeping on the living room couch."
"That's all they wanted."
"It lasted more than a month."
"She is getting better, she is regaining strength."
"You have to stay with her, commit."
"What would you say to him?"
"She is at the top of her game."
"For the first time in years."
"No one had ever told me that."
"It'll be okay, I swear."
"When you back up, it comes from behind."
"How do you want him to be?"
"Have you served in a similar house?"
"I knew what I had to do."
"For someone who wanted to say yes."
"Who only act for money."
"You are the one I chose."
"It's time for his nap."
"What could this mean?"
"Of course I'll tell him."
"I thought you were going to dinner?"
"The Empire has been finished since the war."
"I worked with him for six years."
"Do you believe in women's rights?"
"I would like to hug you."
"You've got balls to stay there."
"The aliens left with the crate."
"What do they want from him?"
"Have you seen what they're doing?"
"What if I don't go?"
"It was a few months ago."
"But I've never seen a ballet."
"I know it's over there."
"What about your father?"
"Anything you want, Mr. Reagan."
"My father was a businessman."
"I want to know what they're up to."
"Make them do what I wanted."
"It will become human again like that."
"Take what we need, gentlemen."
"Have the lambs stopped screaming?"
"I thought you left ten minutes ago."
"Please, stop the charade."
"Do with it what you see fit."
"The envelope is for peace of mind."
"Take your boy and go home."
"This day is getting better and better."
"I will try to find a solution."
"I have to go and make an appearance."
"At least, that's what he says."
"There were a lot of customers."
"It's time to think about yourself."
"You don't need that, man."
"I saw a guy named Red."
"Fireworks in the first minute."
"Who was Lowell's pride before?"
"You will be forced to make a choice."
"The Alliance had to come together now."
"This is what we want to discover."
"And the middle name will be 'Loyal'?"
"We are on our way back."
"I'll see if she's ready."

"He needs to be taken to the hospital."
"Haven't we already discussed this?"
"Not as long as I'm with you."
"From what I know, yes."
"You're going to screw us up."
"I was shot in the arm."
"I promise you'll stay in bed."
"I won't even answer that."
"Unless you don't want to."
"Password please."
"So what does this mean?"
"He seemed to be asking for advice."
"I will do what is necessary to avoid this."
"It must be stopped at all costs."
"What do I do with this guy?"
"How long has this thing been here?"
"We are rightly proud of this."
"It's beyond our means."
"They must be here for the sheep."
"We have the advantage of surprise."
"What will you be able to do?"
"It can be accessed via this climb."
"If you need anything."
"He knew the truth about the queen."
"I can find someone else."
"A friend of mine was wondering about that."
"I wanted to see you before you left."
"It destroys everything it touches."
"The Cylons were created by man."
"No, it's not really my thing."
"Imagine you bought a ticket."
"Who does this kind of stuff, man?"
"I thought it was this way."
"What else did he do?"
"Do you find her prettier than me?"
"Do you really think you're going to win?"
"Open your mouth and stick out your tongue."
"I made you profit."
"The best years of my life."
"You have to understand one thing."
"You will soon be able to take her home."
"One of the possible consequences of your testimony."
"Do you agree to participate in this program?"
"Do you remember what it is?"
"Luckily, our young Potter discovered it."
"I forgot his last name."
"He did the same thing to me."
"One for you and one for you."
"Well, that's about it."
"Is this your usual golf outfit?"
"You don't believe in the Force?"
"I never wanted to do this."
"I want to hear you say my name."
"You're going to show me where it is."
"Do you have any plans with her?"
"No need to do so much."
"There he is, hitting Ward in the body."
"The teacher will speak to you over the loudspeaker."
"A movie star in the family."
"The gas must have invaded the apartment."
"Write a book about what?"
"I need you to cover me."
"I brought him from here."
"Can't you see she's a child?"
"I put her in a taxi."
"When will we see each other?"
"If we can bet, he will be there."
"We want to do business with you."
"I just bit my tongue."
"But these are just words."
"I'm sure he'll come home."
"Why do we do what we do?"
"What do you want, Angel?"
"You can take care of the girlfriend."
"So I can go get your things."
"Who do you think these people were?"
"What were you two talking about?"
"Have you been in contact with him?"
"Nor to let off steam on a Friday night."
"You brought him back to life."
"She's the best in the house."
"Try to understand what we are doing."
"Is that all you find?"
"I know what you should do."
"No, I had never seen it."
"You think I don't understand?"
"I don't know about the others."
"Do you know what his budget was?"
"How many times have I told you."
"Many of you come to thank me."
"I'll show you if you show me."
"It's not done to ask."
"You play eight, right?"
"Put it back where you found it."
"A coffee, like in piano class?"
"Do you know what it could be?"
"What will I tell my father?"
"It's because of my hair."
"I saw you both."
"His body was found at his home."
"It looks like someone was there."
"Just say it, Earl."
"We'll see each other when we see each other."
"Do I look like a gigolo?"
"Do you see anything over there, boss?"
"This is what you need to find out."
"The more they are, the better."
"You want a plane for the troops."
"Are you sure you want some?"
"I did this to protect you."
"Was he your father's lawyer?"
"I'll take it to Lopez myself."
"I thought that was my job."
"Do they take someone every day?"
"Do you have any idea of the monthly charges?"
"No, it's true, I assure you."
"Sail the ocean for eternity."
"I'll see how the others are doing."
"I wonder who did it."

"What is the state of our security?"
"And they took me as their leader."

"Will you be my girlfriend?"
"I want you to swear to me."

"I find these flowers so sexy."
"I'll take the same thing as you."
"There is a doctor there."
"We are always happy to see you."
"One day he came to see me."
"The bar is near the fireplace."
"But you've heard of me."
"This is how I work."
"That's how I walk."
"I wanted it."
"What's it like to be a hero?"
"Tell me you can do it."
"I would have liked to do a lot of things."
"We will all see you again when you return."
"This is between your father and me."
"Is this the end of our adventure?"
"I saw him in my dream."
"But the real goal is power."
"Is it because of last night?"
"I told my father."
"You are looking at him."
"I would like you to do some research."
"Even though I expected better from you."
"Come on, you knew the moment would come."
"You can go out with whoever you want."
"Looks like you were."
"Thank you for bringing my son back to me."
"Someone else will take care of it."
"Would you like to have lunch with me?"
"My mother's earrings."
"My master calls your name, my daughter."
"What do we find there?"
"His plane may be delayed."
"What if you went to get seen?"
"If everything is said, you can leave."
"No, I didn't get it."
"People are running around."
"The truth must be known."
"Maybe he wanted it for me."
"We'll know when we find it."
"It's harder than you think."
"Lieutenant, contact the captains of these vessels."
"Tell your friend to calm down."
"South America is theirs."
"What if she wasn't?"
"I have to finish in there."
"I'll find them a new lawyer."
"I booked under Wallace's name."
"There is a manual for everything."
"There's an exit that way."

"It's always someone else."
"You must learn to control your emotions."
"I hope we will all be there."
"The mummy has only one eye."
"How often do you have sex?"
"The bathroom is over there."
"Do you have your lunch in this box?"
"What will you tell him?"
"And you can afford a woman?"
"You have no self-esteem?"
"So you are 'The Jew Hunter'."
"Of course, I'll be right there."
"First the man, then the theme."
"Maybe it was a big dog."
"I was the one who spoke to him."
"Then we moved into this building."
"I just wanted to be on the show."
"Don't forget to wear white."
"I clean upstairs, you clean downstairs."
"Someone knows more than me."
"I am a prince honest before God."
"If you say so."
"Did they put you in this state?"
"I was wondering where you'd gone."
"Do me a favor anyway."
"Let me tell you this once."
"I am happy to have a son."
"I hope I have some left."
"There is no America."
"It's getting hotter and hotter."
"I go after 'cup', 'pool' and 'giraffe'."
"On the chain, it will make them cum."
"And do you still have any strength left?"
"We need prisoners to interrogate."
"What you do, I do."
"As you can see, we are protected."
"She thinks she's irresistible."
"It gives you goosebumps, doesn't it?"
"At least, that's what I think."
"They even had business cards."
"I'm telling you it's going to be okay."
"All available droids must be engaged."
"Do you want to talk about this?"
"First the guns, and now this."
"We assume that means yes."
"Is there another one?"
"I prefer a worm in my stool."
"But I'll tell it, if you want."
"It's time for your nap."
"The house, at the top of the beach."
"Let's go see what's going on."
"That's what the newspapers say."
"I have a convoy arriving tomorrow."
"What do you do at the newspaper at night?"
"Can we talk, please?"
"But I will come and get her myself."

"You are the TV actress."
"We'll talk about it again later."
"I want you to take care of it."
"Let's follow the Mafia trail here."
"What does he plan to do?"
"See if he returns your greeting."
"I thought we were welcome."
"We built a world of our own."
"I'll pick you up in an hour."
"But we'll take him to the castle."
"You ignored the rules of combat."
"Ah, my dear, was the walk nice?"
"No, I don't want to see that."
"What you call a daredevil."
"She will walk when she decides to."
"Maybe I should introduce myself."
"You want something to eat, huh?"
"He's the man of my life."
"Maybe I should check everything."
"So you better hurry."
"Like everyone else on this ship."
"Does he know what happened to her?"
"What am I going to look like?"
"Did you admire the view this morning?"
"Do you have to read at the table?"
"Well, you'll see, she's great."
"That was hours ago."
"I think they're hiding something."
"I didn't answer the phone."

"I've been gone for a long time."
"Yes, I found the same thing."

"Please repeat it again."
"I guarantee the boss will protect you."
"There is a crowd approaching."
"I'll give you one too."
"You will become Lina's partner."
"You just have to listen."
"You think we don't know?"
"And this is where she will be."
"I'm going to tell you a little secret."
"I asked him the same question."
"But someone else can."
"Do you want me to cut it?"
"He said he came to drink a Coke."
"She has a red handbag."
"I know I betrayed you."
"She has already had nose surgery."
"You're not out of the woods yet."
"Does anyone see us?"
"That's what the newspaper says."
"What if you can't find them?"
"It wasn't a click of the tongue."
"A lot of things, actually."
"He knows the powers of the Force."
"This is a gift from me."
"I have already answered this question."
"You don't need medication."
"You looked like you were having fun."
"Go fuck yourself among the Greeks."
"Just pull the trigger."
"It's an honor to know you."

"What if reality is me?"
"I watch him do his crossword puzzles."
"Just once in a while."
"But in Geneva, everyone dances."
"Because you betrayed yourself, Captain."
"And we will be young together again."
"And tell him you love him?"
"What if he isn't there?"
"You are stronger than your father."
"Do you believe in crocodiles in the sewers?"
"I believe there is a force controlling you."
"You went further than expected."
"I had more money to eat."
"You better tell the truth."
"I swore to tell the truth."
"I understand exactly how you feel."
"Maybe you should get a job."
"I did a bit of two-wheeling."
"I thought you agreed."
"I bet you anything."
"Everyone will realize it."
"Does that mean you forgive me?"
"I was working for Fallon at the time."
"Were you thinking about a financing plan?"

"And now you're still coding?"
"I'm going to drink a glass of water."
"You should have more confidence in yourself."
"That's what you think."
"What is the access code?"
"I found it in the jungle."
"You know what I'm doing."
"But you've heard about me."

"Go see what happened."
"I know people like you."

"Come on, I'll make you something to eat."
"I must say I am intrigued."
"I wanted you to feel better."
"I still have a little time."
"Under the noses of the intelligence services?"
"This was your plan all along."
"These people know who you really are."
"Can I sit next to you?"
"I don't think we should."
"We have a lot of catching up to do."
"Was the press there?"
"You're going to start wearing a headscarf."
"What size levels do you need?"
"Audrey takes care of these things."
"He goes towards the children's room."
"To make the world a little better."
"I think I heard a crack."
"You brought her, you sting her."
"I can change that, if you want."
"Is that all you do?"
"I'm the one to blame."
"What you do is very important."
"But I have to get over this, right?"
"That's what we're told."
"Mr. Bentley, you must have known Lawrence well."
"This is where I should be."
"Tell yourself it's a hobby."
"Make sure he does."
"Are you doing anything right now?"
"We have something to ask you."
"Actually, there is one."
"You found it."
"I'm behind you one hundred percent."
"Do you know who's on the phone?"
"This is all advertising."
"I know a lot about it, you know."
"Ask him if he feels the pressure."
"I've done it twice already."
"Are you interested in what I say?"
"I need to go freshen up."
"Is this your father's car?"
"I want to find it good."
"What if there was nothing?"
"I have a message from your father."
"Did you bring Baby back with you?"
"This is what's left of it."
"The witness may answer the question."
"As you see, we are free."
"It's the big night for you."
"Now I know who you really are."
"I have to leave it open when I receive."
"It puts immortality out of reach."
"They just obeyed an order."
"Good episode to all."
"It's the first door on the left."
"One day we will have to talk."
"They must leave the battlefield."
"It needs to be brought back and studied."
"It was my mother's first name."
"How do you know she'll be there?"
"What am I going to take?"
"There's someone on it."
"Look what you did to me."
"So who can you trust?"
"But he is not the same anymore."
"The best pirate I've ever seen."
"It must provide him with oxygen."
"The full moon is in two days."
"May I continue, please?"
"I had a project in mind."
"What would you have wanted me to do?"
"The Führer will come to the premiere."
"People don't believe in heroes anymore."
"What would it do to him?"
"Isn't that what you do?"
"What would you have said?"
"Do you want me to introduce you to him?"
"I have a workshop in the garage."
"The memory of what they were doing."
"You are expected to use your judgment."
"It's a real pack of wolves."
"It's between my daughter and me."
"Can't you afford one?"
"I had a very nice evening."
"No, I understand. He's super cool."
"What's going on, buddy?"
"Despite the way it turned out?"
"It is a privilege to meet you."
"What did Dawson say about this?"
"So what is it really about?"
"He succeeded thanks to the internet."
"If you control McNamara, you control Kennedy."
"Maybe he needs money."
"Just when my engine was starting to warm up."
"There's mail for you."
"And I have work to do."
"I knew she had been engaged."
"There may be side effects."
"The CIA has always known about their existence."
"How did you get to this point?"
"She couldn't do that."
"Don't want to park here?"
"He said he would be back soon."
"That's it, once a year."
"Maybe you'll go to 'The Tavern'."
"Did you have to do it on foot?"
"All you're missing is the story."
"When do I start to get used to it?"
"This is the captain speaking to you."
"Everyone understand the plan?"
"We had a delivery for you."
"I want to know more about him."
"The salesman was going to give him a mole."
"It's your turn to go to bed."
"It's such a safe feeling."
"You're the only one who thinks that."
"But it's up to you."
"What are you looking for, Pam?"
"It took me three months to receive it."
"I've thought about all this carefully."
"Is there a phone around here?"
"Stay alert on the dashboard."
"And what will you look like?"
"I am better equipped to win."
"I didn't see anything else."
"He will ask you if you are progressing."
"I'm glad we came."
"Tony T. had another son, Vincent."
"You'll be the one on duty."
"But fate decided otherwise."
"He came two or three times."
"Just before we close the kitchen."
"As for the Williams, their income is secret."
"I knew exactly what I was doing."
"I just wanted to tell you about my dream."
"What are these men doing in my base?"
"You meet people like me there."
"Have you confirmed this with the locals?"
"Tell me what you found."
"What was in the bag?"
"I appoint you head of the music department."
"I'll go make you some coffee."
"I thought we were going to Morocco."
"I take care of the accounts with them."
"You got what you paid for."
"No, you didn't say that."
"This is the sound of my voice."
"And you, how did it go?"
"I know what I mean."
"The clerk will read the verdict."
"Is something missing?"
"I started seeing things."
"There are probably other weirdos here."
"Maybe we pushed him."
"I haven't even started yet."
"I have more experience than you."
"It just so happens to be me."
"It's been in the garage for three years."
"The Child Protection Center."
"Please, not so fast."
"He seemed delighted to be rid of it."
"You already know what they say."
"Yes, I guess that's true."
"Have we found each other, you and I?"
"My doors are no longer closed to you."
"There's a lunch to be won."
"He offers me to live with him."
"Sorry for inviting you."
"Emerging from a half-erased dream."
"It's your mother's birthday."
"And the truth is on your side."
"And swim to shore."
"Is there a doctor around here?"
"Thank everyone for me."
"I remember every one of your laughs."
"What are you doing in a place like this?"
"I have some very, very good news."
"A job I gave you."
"Or at least not until tomorrow night."
"We have to stay outside until dawn."
"This is the last time, friend."
"Who do we send it to first?"
"I'm comfortable with you."
"He just entered the picture."
"I'm often on call at night."
"We found this in your office."
"What movies have you seen me in?"
"But you have to ask nicely for things."
"I am the captain of this ship."
"You got pregnant on the island."
"He knew what was going to happen."
"I've always been on your side."
"What happened to this man?"
"So what do you decide?"
"No, I have never been married."
"Okay, we're almost there."
"You mean at what exact moment?"
"I want to talk to him about his property."
"Even accountants have imagination."
"I got you half price."
"What happened to you there?"
"No, but it's of the same order."
"I want peace, and anonymity."
"I'm going to hug you."
"You need to eat before you go home."
"It's time to look for a psychiatrist."
"I told you to look at me."
"It would be easier without the bra."
"Captain, submarine on the port bow."
"When should I have noticed?"
"Seriously, what's going on?"
"It suddenly stopped."
"Is it time to talk about it?"
"How did you know where we were?"
"Will you find someone who loves you like I do?"
"For some, she even has two."
"So you'll have to wake him up."
"You made that clear to me."
"Yeah, my mother-in-law loves this stuff."
"Can I know what it is?"
"May joy live in us forever."
"Is that all I get?"
"It's kind of a special occasion."
"It's almost tea time."
"Luckily, I'm not one of them."
"I want to have children with you."
"We'll see you in action."
"I went to South Dakota."
"There's like a leak."
"I know you like it very much."
"Did you think he wouldn't tell me anything?"
"I've seen one like this before."
"I don't think it's him."
"That's what my father thought."
"He never told you?"
"I have a model of his handwriting."
"As if that meant anything."
"These are Cher's panties."
"You've crossed over to the other side."
"Do we have the same principles as them?"
"What are you two doing here?"
"Do you know what you're doing, Ali?"
"I found this in the Reserve."
"Respect for elders builds character."
"I wish he was here."
"What triggered it?"
"Until it's over."
"How much you've grown."
"The first flight leaving Germany."
"I thought we understood each other."
"I was in the ice cream aisle."
"That's what Dad would have wanted."
"This is what you have to understand."
"I didn't want anyone to know."
"It was probably to play on diversity."
"I thought you weren't listening."
"How dare you say such a thing?"
"My friend says you are a stallion."
"You knew him, didn't you?"
"I had a high opinion of Bell."
"I saw what I wanted."
"You don't want to talk to me about it?"
"With you, we're like kids."
"Get everyone on board."
"The queen of bitches in the universe."
"You think you're above everything."
"And one day earlier in August."
"Plus, he has a sexy voice."
"Have you at least talked to him about it?"
"Our intelligence had Oswald in its files."
"What's this boat thing about?"
"This question was just a question."
"I saw this person too."
"Where are your mom and dad?"
"I could, but I don't want to."
"She didn't know what she was doing."
"I'm so glad you're here."
"Do you know what's in it?"
"That's why I love him."
"Who do I have the honor of speaking to?"
"There's something in the air."
"It was the year everything changed."
"No, you didn't tell me."
"It had to happen one day or another."
"That's where I saw him."
"I'm going to be late for school."
"Is it money you want?"
"We're lucky to have him."
"I think I'll go to bed."
"This is where you come in."
"Get out of the car, please."
"I'll see if the coast is clear."
"But what got into you?"
"I wanted to tell you that I love you."
"Think about what I told you."
"What does he have to do with it?"
"I told you it was over."
"Is that what they told you?"
"What's in this box?"
"Is that what you were told?"
"What's in it for your service?"
"Do you have what I asked you for?"
"I didn't ask you to come."
"She's lucky to have you."
"You don't need to explain yourself."
"He's lucky to have you."
"I know what he did to you."
"What do you have in there?"
"I never said anything like that."
"I'll tell you anything you want."
"Just a touch and I see things."
"I apologize for earlier."
"A glass of water, please."
"You have nothing else to do?"
"I only have eyes for you."
"How does it feel to be a hero?"
"What else did he tell you?"
"You take me for someone else."
"What else do you want me to do?"
"I wanted to apologize for the other day."
"Did you tell him you loved him?"
"I told you I loved you."
"You told me you loved me."
"I want you to be proud of me."
"I'm glad you could come."
"I want you to stay here with me."
"I'm glad you did."
"My feelings for you haven't changed."
"No, I didn't sleep with him."
"I'm going to ask you a series of questions."
"What did you bring me?"
"I think I owe you an apology."
"Do you want me to tell you the truth?"
"Want to know what I think?"
"I need to tell you something."
"That's what I'm trying to say."
"That's exactly what I did."
"And you know what I did?"
"My mouth is watering."
"I'm lucky to have you."
"But that's all I have."
"That's what I've always done."
"This is exactly what I needed."
"I did everything you wanted."
"That's all I needed."
"I need some air."
"I thought you might need it."
"I'm a bit hungover."
"I just need more time."
"I did what I did."
"That's exactly what I was going to say."
"Yeah, that's what I said."
"But what do I know about it?"
"That's what I've always said."
"I saw your picture in the newspaper."
"Did you see what I did?"
"I hope you had a good trip."
"I forgot what I was going to say."
"I told you I was fine."
"I need to take my mind off things."
"Is that something I said?"
"I need a glass of water."
"I have everything you need."
"I need to ask you some questions."
"That's what I love about you."
"Do you think there is a connection?"
"Do you want me to tell you a story?"
"A friend and I found her."
"Do you want me to bring you something?"
"I think I'm in love with you."
"It is a pleasure to deal with you."
"What is that supposed to say?"
"I will give you everything I have."
"My parents live across the street from us."
"That's where we met."
"I told you everything would be fine."
"If you want me to leave, say so."
"How could you do such a thing?"
"You haven't changed a bit."
"That's the impression I got."
"There is food in the fridge."
"It's the least you can do."
"Do you want me to draw you a picture?"
"I want you to tell me the truth."
"The Earth is a huge treasure island."
"This is a flash of the Breath of Freedom."
"I need you to come with me."
"I have something that might interest you."
"I'll only ask you once."
"May I ask you a question?"
"A little of this, a little of that."
"Think about all we've accomplished."
"Do you realize what you just did?"
"Leave me a message and I'll call you back."
"Hot in Cleveland is recorded in front of an audience."
"There are three flowers in a vase."
"A machine that spies on you day and night."
"All this doesn't mean anything to me."
"This is the story of the last Babylon station."
"My wife and daughter were kidnapped."
"I did what you said."
"But I know what I saw."
"What could that mean?"
"What do we do with them?"
"I ask you this as a friend."
"What's out there?"
"What brought you here?"
"She did this to me."
"Is that what you wanted to tell me?"
"What's that doing there?"
"I learned what had happened."
"I have a million things to do."
"There is a way to find out."
"What's behind that door?"
"In the footsteps of God, he must advance."
"What did I do again?"
"Nobody knows what happened."
"What don't you like?"
"You took the words right out of my mouth."
"I'll get you a glass of water."
"Your mother was a beauty champion."
"Looks like we have company."
"What did he do to deserve this?"
"Please do it for me."
"Come on, I have something to show you."
"There is something I am missing."
"I can't talk about that now."
"Did you do all this?"
"I hope you are proud of yourself."
"That's how I love you."
"Hey, easy, what's going on?"
"No, it's up to me to do it."
"I know what you told me."
"That's what I told you."
"Did you see what he did?"
"Is that what you want to tell me?"
"I've never heard anything like it."
"We received reports of gunshots."
"But there is a price to pay."
"I have a few more questions for you."
"You have the right to say nothing."
"It's not just about you."
"It was a pleasure working with you."
"You remember that, don't you?"
"That's what I just did."
"What does he have that I don't?"
"Take off his collar before you bury him."
"I am a CIA double agent."
"I have a lot to tell you."
"I don't know, but I can try."
"I need you to trust me."
"You are what you choose to be."
"Looking at you, did it make you hungry?"
"I must learn to be one of them."
"It was the best time of my life."
"It's a pleasure working with you."
"Did you understand what I said?"
"What did I teach you?"
"I want to know what's going on here."
"I would have gone with you all the way."
"Tell him what I told you."
"And when you're right, you're right."
"I wish you all the happiness in the world."
"Its plants, its rivers, its roads, its inhabitants."
"I want everyone to know this."
"What's wrong with your neck?"
"I know what you did to him."
"I think it's more than that."
"I know I can count on you."
"This is what I've always dreamed of."
"I'll see what's going on."
"What do you care what I do with it?"
"I never intended to."
"I was told he was here."
"Even the wisest cannot say."
"Do you see what you're making me do?"
"He's the one who shot me."
"Do you want me to tell you something?"
"It's time to put an end to this."
"That's what I call it."
"What did she do now?"
"I thought he would never leave."
"I told everyone."
"I don't think he will."
"That's all there was to it."
"What else does it say?"
"I'm the one who gives the orders here."
"I dreamed of seeing the kings of old."
"I know what I look like."
"You still love him, don't you?"
"You didn't answer my calls."
"Who is that man in the corner?"
"I am not what you think."
"That's where I found it."
"I would love to hold him one last time."
"Are you sure you don't want to come?"
"We were lucky with him."
"Is this how you apologize?"
"There is one who can unite them."
"I'll ask you again."
"What did she give you?"
"That's all we found."
"What's so special about her?"
"I hope you enjoyed the music."
"Mom, I have something to tell you."
"Because that's what I want."
"The force has left the world of men."
"It's you I want to talk to."
"I've never heard of you."
"What is not true?"
"That's what they call me."
"Both, as often as possible."
"You are indeed your father's son."
"I'm the one who brought him here."
"Do you know what I told him?"
"They are made for each other."
"Not from what I've seen."
"Driving licence and registration card, please."
"And one and two and three and four."
"I can't tell you now."
"That's how it works, right?"
"What can happen to us in the Shire?"
"Please don't say that."
"This is what I want you to do."
"And what did I do?"
"Did you do well at school?"
"What's gotten into you?"
"Did you tell him I was here?"
"I could say the same about you."
"What really makes a man?"
"I'm glad to hear you say that."
"It just didn't work."
"There is a reason for all this."
"Do you want me to take you home?"
"You may have come to explain this to me."
"No, this is not the right time."
"Because I didn't."
"When was the last time you ate?"
"You have to tell me what's going on."
"I want to introduce you to a friend of mine."
"I wish it had been different."
"I would have loved to hold him one last time."
"There is a lot of work to be done."
"What brings you to town?"
"He is waiting to take him across the sea."
"It will depend on how you come back."
"You have to tell him how you feel."
"We had the first one, but the second one?"
"Don't you think it's time?"
"Who put this idea into your head?"
"He has giants fighting over him."
"That's very kind of you to say that."
"What is that over there?"
"If they want war, they will have it."
"You will have to be whole for many years."
"I did what I was asked."
"I said everything I knew."
"No, it's not the same thing."
"Would you mind doing something for me?"
"That's all we ask of you."
"They're lucky to have you."
"We're glad you found us."
"You lived your life for the king."
"I will say what I have to say."
"This is about you."
"Truth comes from the mouths of babes."
"I appreciate everything you have done."
"I want to know what he said."
"Not everyone is like you."
"I know what they did to you."
"That's exactly what she said."
"That's how I started."
"Drew, you're one of us."
"Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you."
"And I want you to come with me."
"It feels good to be back."
"I was thinking about you."
"She was here a minute ago."
"You can ask me whatever you want."
"He left an hour ago."
"Do you want to know what I did?"
"Can I talk to you, please?"
"He asked me to give this to you."
"What did he tell me?"
"Oh my God, what happened?"
"What is it supposed to be?"
"I told you what I wanted."
"It's the least he can do."
"Maybe I wasn't clear."
"What makes us lucky?"
"Those who come from Heaven do not see."
"I need to go to the hospital."
"Isn't that how they say it?"
"But what can we do?"
"This is the best I can do."
"He did it, didn't he?"
"That's how it is and that's all."
"This is the first time this has happened."
"I might have something for you."
"I wonder what happened."
"Did you hear what she said?"
"And me, what do I do?"
"This is where our paths separate."
"Yeah, that's what he said."
"I have a lot of things to tell you."
"No idea what that means."
"That's what I was thinking too."
"Listen, I have something to tell you."
"You're lucky to have him."
"You only do what you want."
"You really love him, don't you?"
"That's why you love me."
"I told myself I could overcome anything."
"Everything I said is true."
"Because that's what I do."
"What's in the trunk?"
"That's exactly what I mean."
"I wonder what it could be."
"That's all I want to do."
"But what am I doing here?"
"What are we going to do here?"
"I forgot what I wanted to say."
"That's what everyone does."
"I guess I owe you an apology."
"That's what I'm paid for."
"This is what he always wanted."
"No one has ever called me that."
"What are you doing exactly?"
"I'm sure it's over there."
"They completed their growth during the journey."
"Is that why you left?"
"That's all that happened."
"You want to tell me what's going on?"
"One at a time, please."
"Is this how it's going to be?"
"I'm sure you know something."
"I hope it won't be long."
"There is a way around it."
"That's what they call it."
"We will need the details of each column."
"What did they do to me?"
"My mother did it."
"I didn't do anything, I swear."
"Beware of what comes from above."
"I'm asking you."
"There is one thing that escapes me."
"I know exactly what you mean."
"I'll take care of it, I'll take care of it."
"I'm sure we can work something out."
"That's what I'm wondering."
"We have to look on the bright side."
"And you know what happened?"
"I didn't think they would."
"All right, here's what we're going to do."
"I only met him once."
"What were you doing in there?"
"Tell me what's in it."
"You seem to get along well."
"You look great to me."
"Give me diamonds and make me disappear."
"You swore to make Spider-Man pay."
"What did you do, Bobby?"
"I knew there was something up."
"He was able to bring the Ring here."
"I wanted to apologize for the other night."
"I decided not to go."
"Please make yourself at home."
"Let's see if you don't have any critters."
"Of course I remember you."
"He seems to like you."
"A man must have principles."
"Six years pass in the blink of an eye."
"But what is he doing there?"
"This is exactly what is happening to us."
"May I examine what is in your bag?"
"No, I don't want you to leave."
"He kicked me."
"Were you the one who called the police?"
"I want you to do me a favor."
"A truly interesting phenomenon from a biological point of view."
"Don't believe everything you read."
"You have to listen to what she tells you."
"What do you have to do?"
"Let's see what he's got."
"Have you ever been treated in the county?"
"No phone calls without his consent."
"That's what people do, right?"
"I have just what you need."
"You could have told me earlier."
"But you know that, don't you?"
"I'm learning to trust my body."
"That's all I heard."
"How dare you speak to me in that tone?"
"We have a lot to tell each other."
"You were overcome with emotion."
"You made all this up in your head."
"I came to take you home."
"We'll get along fine if you relax."
"Is that what you want to talk about?"
"Do you think I'm going to tell you?"
"How much do you pay me to do your job?"
"No, it's not about that."
"And you, what do you have?"
"You know what would make you feel better?"
"She is not in her normal state."
"I swear I didn't do anything."
"Times are tough for everyone."
"This is exactly what you need."
"Maybe they're looking for us."
"You would know, if you had been trained."
"We have to trust him."
"You must have seen this on TV."
"That he was good, that he was wise?"
"He was the one who came to see me."
"He arrived two days ago."
"And I know what you're up to too."
"That's what I was getting at."
"I'll tell you what you want to know."
"My friends are toys that I make."
"I told him not to resist."
"They tell us what the Force wants."
"I'm going to ask you one last time."
"Is there a role for me?"
"And what did they say?"
"Your mother would have wanted you to hold on."
"I'll tell you what it means."
"I think it's for the best."
"Few people can afford this quality."
"I gave you what you wanted."
"I knew we could count on you."
"I want to see the effect on a human."
"This is a step in the right direction."
"Tell her she needs to eat."
"I thought it would do me good."
"But sooner or later, you have to wake up."
"I have to get that bullet out of you."
"It's time to go to the bathroom."
"But it's a long-term project."
"I am being chased by a psychopathic military commander."
"Thanks to you, we have the last piece."
"All right, what's this strategy thing?"
"No, there's no one else."
"My head is a little dizzy."
"You don't have to answer that."
"There is no war here."
"So what's the matter?"
"What did she do to him?"
"How do I know if I can trust you?"
"What's in this package?"
"What did you do to us?"
"No, you have your nose in the screen."
"I'm telling you what I saw."
"If I do, I will be one of them."
"That's what I always thought."
"I know what he means to you."
"I think there is something else."
"But that's worth more than my life."
"You did well to come see me."
"We slide, one to the right, one to the left."
"I saw them yesterday in the harbor."
"I guess you want to take up the sword again."
"I told you what I knew."
"He did what he had to do."
"There is a lion on campus."
"It's to see you better, my child."
"The Babylon Project was a dream come true."
"I don't take this lightly."
"It's time to take action."
"That's why he left."
"It only preserves the balance of life."
"I just have a few questions for you."
"I thought we were telling each other the truth."
"He told me to give this to you."
"I hope you found your refuge."
"I know what you have in mind."
"I told him not to come."
"They constantly feel the presence of the Ring."
"Because that's what's happening."
"Dragon, we turn left and go back."
"You are my only connection to the world."
"I have what you asked for."
"It's only you who matters."
"They left an hour ago."
"Is that why you came back?"
"So what are we doing here?"
"No, you're not there at all."
"Your faith in your friends is your own."
"Splash water on your face."
"All the prisoners on the ground, lying flat on their stomachs."
"But what's wrong with you all?"
"Shall I go with you in your ship?"
"I did nothing of the sort."
"He's the one you need to talk to."
"Did you tie these knots?"
"What in heaven's name have you done?"
"I'd like to take a look at it."
"A gift from the governor of Sicily, lord."
"Did she do this to you?"
"We have full reports on their movements."
"Is that all you're going to say?"
"It reminds me of what's in store for us here."
"I only saw him twice."
"I slept with someone else."
"Tiny organisms present in every living cell."
"I think you did it on purpose."
"I could use a hand."
"You are the only one who can do it."
"The bonus would allow them to buy their parts."
"What's on his mind?"
"They have the largest fleet in the world."
"I need time to think about it."
"I climbed every hill to find you."
"I didn't think you would."
"I think we've seen enough."
"Call me back as soon as you get this message."
"I'm entitled to a phone call."
"Stay close to me, you will be safe."
"I need you for the harvest."
"All I have is this."
"We will find you what you are looking for."
"The queen orders that her maid accompany you."
"Thank you for what you are trying to do."
"What do you know, Capone?"
"On a normal day, we would have plenty of time."
"Not in the way you mean it."
"You look like you need it."
"I think I have something they will like."
"I bought the Senate behind his back."
"That's what I'm talking to you about."
"It had nothing to do with you."
"That's what I was trying to say."
"I told you, I'm fine."
"But what got into me?"
"Don't you believe what you see?"
"I'll give them a hand."
"That's what I was trying to do."
"I gave everything I had."
"You know you can trust me."
"There are no soldiers here."
"I did everything he wanted."
"Do you believe in the queen's idea?"
"But what did he do?"
"I came as soon as I heard."
"She told me she loved me."
"I'll tell Mom not to sell you."
"Words are stones in my heart."
"I tried to call you several times."
"With time and practice, you will understand."
"I have so many questions to ask you."
"You should be congratulated on that."
"I bought a wet nurse for him yesterday."
"Is that what you like, Captain?"
"Are there others like you?"
"What do you have against him?"
"I meant everything I said."
"He sees things before they happen."
"How long has it been since you saw him?"
"Tell them everything that happened."
"A word before the execution of the sentence?"
"The more the better."
"She looked me straight in the eyes."
"There are mines there and there."
"You're not smart for that."
"But that's all we have."
"There's always a bigger one."
"I know what's in it."
"That's what I like about her."
"I feel like we're being watched."
"That's the only thing that matters to me."
"I thought there was no one there."
"Explain to him about TV, games, etc."
"I was saving it for a more opportune moment."
"Well, you know what I mean."
"I didn't think he would."
"This film is based on a true story."
"You have no idea how much."
"I'll come by your shop to pick up the boy."
"I wonder what I'm doing here."
"You know what's the hardest part?"
"Who is ready is up to us to decide."
"I hope I haven't forgotten anything."
"Just tell me what to do."
"It's time to party."
"What is he doing up there?"
"I hope you learned your lesson."
"The important thing is that we are together."
"He's been gone for two months."
"I'm here to force you to meet your deadlines."
"But what does it matter?"
"I will write to say if I am free."
"Once again, here you are before us, Your Highness."
"That's how I feel about you."
"There are many things to do."
"What's so surprising about that?"
"I have powerful allies at court."
"I think it's a great idea."
"You must trust me, Your Highness."
"I want you out of my life."
"It is an honor to work with you."
"You need to come home."
"What makes you so happy?"
"Do you have money to pay for this?"
"Where were you two nights ago?"
"I need to take care of this."
"What's taking you so long?"
"For a smaller sum, I did it."
"That's what we're trying to do."
"I need to hear you say it."
"I have a small favor to ask of you."
"I did as you told me."
"Man is a wolf to man."
"Is that what you said?"
"Jan told you about Reno, right?"
"That's how he did it."
"No, I don't know where he is."
"Is that all you're capable of?"
"It's in the envelope, on the mantelpiece."
"What did he give you?"
"I've never heard of her."
"Do you want to give me a hand?"
"You don't believe what you're saying."
"I saw what he did."
"This role is destroying you."
"We saw it with our own eyes."
"But that's what happened."
"I take back everything I said."
"I love him more than anything in the world."
"What's in a name?"
"What happened to Mom?"
"If there's anything I can do."
"I read you like a book."
"Do I look like I need it?"
"Can I have some paper and pencil?"
"Because of what you did."
"But what am I going to do?"
"What do we do with this?"
"Is there anything we can do?"
"How could she do this to me?"
"What do you want me to do with this?"
"Tell my children that I love them."
"I've never heard of them."
"It's more than I can bear."
"This is the first time in my life."
"There are thousands like this."
"You're no match for him."
"I've already given the role to Lily."
"I had to get you out of there."
"I have tons of stuff to do."
"I want you to come live with me."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please give me your attention."
"Is this something I did?"
"What is there about him?"
"Leave now before the soldiers come?"
"Where did your sense of humor go?"
"I was hoping you could tell me."
"That's why I called."
"No, what do you mean?"
"Do you think I need you?"
"We swear to do whatever you want."
"Do you remember what you were saying?"
"I have better things to do with my time."
"No question of wearing anything."
"I'm going to a motel for a few days."
"What makes grass grow?"
"They take by force, it's their nature."
"We know he's in on it."
"And I report the person to the police."
"Most of you will go to Vietnam."
"Have you seen what time it is?"
"It's just down the street."
"We made love under the oak tree."
"I want to know what's going on."
"Tell me what you want to do with it."
"Any idea what happened?"
"Do you want me to sing you a song?"
"There is the other side of the coin."
"I suggest you get going."
"It must have slipped his mind."
"There has been a change of plans."
"I said I would do it."
"You will be entitled to the gladiator loop."
"Cassie, the lady in the rocking chair."
"Is that why you do this?"
"The next day, early in the morning, the phone rings."
"It's the best part of my day."
"Orange and I jumped in the car."
"I've already had that one done to me."
"It is up to the Senate to pronounce the punishment."
"I'll give you five cents for your cake."
"My opinion on our involvement in the war?"
"You have to do what I tell you."
"He finally hit the jackpot."
"But we have a nice list of conquests."
"I have something to tell you too."
"There must be an answer to everything."
"Were you the one who found the body?"
"Look and tell me what you see."
"I put everyone in line."
"I can give you a hand."
"He followed us everywhere and closely."
"Victor, please come join us."
"You will only speak when you are spoken to."
"I had time to think about it."
"You love the Blessed Virgin, don't you?"
"What's keeping you awake?"
"At least that's what I believe."
"It's my bachelor party."
"I have the right to ask the question."
"I played on the Notre Dame team."
"I would like to ask you a very important question."
"You know that's against the rules."
"You can say a prayer, if you like."
"You will have to, sooner than you think."
"It was in the heat of the moment."
"Is this heaven?"
"Do you think I meant to get to this point?"
"All my life I've been waiting for this moment."
"The guys must have brought something down."
"That's what I wanted to talk about."
"I wonder if he had any prior history."
"How long will it take for him to be here?"
"Hello, is anyone here?"
"Tell me instead what happened."
"Can I give you a hand?"
"It's not just about that."
"I don't take orders."
"It's a bachelor party."
"What do you think happened?"
"That's how it works here."
"I was thinking about the fact that I love you."
"And from there, embark for his country."
"From the gentleman opposite."
"I have such an urge to fuck."
"That's the bottom line."
"Can someone explain to me what is happening?"
"Have you seen a lot of fights?"
"Making martyrs is my forte."
"I knew something was going on."
"Where Barry's regiment was heading."
"You must not be seen."
"Tell me exactly what you saw."
"That way I could see who had money."
"I did everything you asked."
"This is one of the parameters of my mission."
"I keep seeing them hiding."
"What do I deserve pleasure for?"
"I saw it just now."
"That's all I want to hear."
"My friends and I were chosen."
"Can't you do better than that?"
"Do you think there are enough?"
"He arrived an hour ago."
"I dreamed about Del's mouse."
"What did you say your name was?"
"What's that inscription on your helmet?"
"Do you turn everything off at night?"
"What is your name and where are you going?"
"She left a while ago."
"By the way, who are you bringing these dispatches to?"
"Put me on the sidewalk, I'll manage."
"I know we would be good parents."
"That's why I love them."
"That's all we can say."
"There must be someone else."
"Someone you'll pray with?"
"A lady in Chicago wrote a book."
"She is Mrs. H. She is beautiful."
"Make me have a million dollars."
"What do you have tonight?"
"It's a whole, a very small world."
"Kindly, he wanted to cheer you up."
"Nothing left and eternity to think about it."
"If you want to dream, that's your business."
"This is where it is most useful."
"But I see what you mean."
"I don't need another one."
"There are so many things to do."
"That's what we train for."
"But what did I say?"
"The workshop roof needs to be redone."
"There are two legions in the garrison."
"Say whatever comes to mind."
"She was just a force of nature."
"At camp, Barry's training continued."
"Is that how you see it?"
"He was there a moment ago."
"My current mission fits me like a glove."
"I'm sure he's doing great."
"I've already told the police everything."
"Can you tell us what's going on?"
"Sometimes we talked until sunrise."
"He is in front, in the section area."
"Anything it can analyze by contact."
"Percy, I have a few questions for you."
"However, I cannot grant your request."
"And the spider that lived outside your window?"
"Nobody knows what's going on here."
"It's the exception that proves the rule."
"You stopped saying they exist."
"I have some money saved up."
"After what I did for you."
"You will probably have a few hours."
"So that's what I'm going to do."
"What did they do to us?"
"What if I don't agree?"
"And what does it matter?"
"Another thing is to see it up close."
"Maybe once he's satisfied, he'll leave."
"Is that what's keeping you awake?"
"You're about to pass out."
"I know what kind of man you are."
"Do you want me to hold your hand?"
"Mr. Hughes, please rise to take the oath of office."
"Think about what you just did."
"Back in the cell for evening roll call."
"Do you know where we're taking you tonight?"
"What do you like most?"
"But what she said was true."
"I'm just a businessman."
"It's about much more than that."
"Look what I did for you."
"Can you leave us, please?"
"I thought about you all night."
"Do you do everything I tell you to?"
"It's a pleasure to finally meet you."
"Do you have family nearby?"
"So what do we have here?"
"The little one has to hide for a while."
"Because that's what we do."
"You don't think I know that?"
"That's what he told us."
"Do you know what I was told?"
"I never thought I'd see you here."
"I love you, Spartacus, like my own father."
"I have to hide to see my friends."
"What's going on around here?"
"You take the first job that comes along."
"What did I just do?"
"I have summoned the Senate to hear you."
"It's the most beautiful thing in the world."
"There is something written on it."
"I don't want that at the table."
"Because that's what you do."
"You told him, didn't you?"
"What did we imagine?"
"I have a bunch of convictions as a book."
"What's going on with her?"
"I go into the bathroom, and who's there?"
"I already have everything I want."
"Is that what you were talking about, Locke?"
"Always happy to welcome the Board of Directors."
"I wish you had told me."
"You must have said ten words from Zurich."
"What is a game?"
"Do you know what that did to me?"
"Maybe there's no one there."
"No, it wasn't that fast."
"He's fine, he's a big boy."
"Easy to get there by car from Paris."
"Let me give you a hand."
"I'll tell you when I know."
"Now he doesn't have to."
"Nothing is known about his mother yet."
"It's time to get to work."
"When was the last time you had it?"
"That's what I thought I understood."
"The few who survived had a gift."
"And what brings you here?"
"I had heard about the sweep."
"I have a mandate that says something else."
"Well, did they do that to me?"
"Some of you won't believe it."
"The whole system started to fail."
"I take back what I just said."
"That's the kind of guy he is."
"I want six cups of coffee."
"I was told to come see you."
"I've seen this hundreds of times."
"She's gone for two days, thank God."
"There are others like you."
"Hence God, and his theory of probability."
"Hi, what are you doing here?"
"I bet he's in the Zone."
"You can stay here as long as you want."
"You're the one who should see a shrink."
"I am one of your biggest fans."
"I have something important to say."
"It's either one or the other."
"What happened in Marseille?"
"Bobby, what did you do?"
"It seems that this will be a memorable evening."
"It's so good to hear your voice."
"Good to see you, buddy."
"Which brings me to my next question."
"Not all men are like you."
"I haven't seen him since yesterday."
"These things happen in the world."
"To what do I owe the honor of your visit?"
"I was told to give this to you."
"And you know what he said?"
"You need each other."
"That's the last thing I want."
"This could be our last night on Earth."
"It was my brother Dominic who held it."
"I hadn't heard that since school."
"That's all I said."
"I forgot to tell you something."
"I want to know what happened to him."
"You like him very much, don't you?"
"He shot a bullet into the ceiling."
"That's what I wanted to ask you."
"You never know what's going to happen."
"Whatever we do, we have to stay together."
"I promised Herr Hitler a miracle."
"It's better that you don't know."
"I guarantee there is one."
"Season after season, he was a surefire winner."
"Raise another one and accompany your men."
"Let's say he decided."
"Over time, you will find it rather light."
"M can do without me for a few days."
"That of a bright planet called Earth."
"If we said it, we did it."
"They told me you were here."
"Is that what happened?"
"That's why we love him."
"On a machine, one chance in a million."
"It's nice of you to think of me."
"Do you want to get me a piece of cake?"
"They say that clothes make the man."
"There's a new sheriff in town."
"I was on the other side of the world."
"Three years of seminary before becoming a cop."
"We have a patient who is critically ill."
"She doesn't know what she's saying anymore."

"I should have come and picked you up myself."
"You have just entered the Twilight Zone."
"I promise you it won't happen again."
"You brought it here, you bring it back."
"If you feel like it, go ahead and talk."
"He was the one who sent me there."
"How did it go at school?"
"You just have to change your function."
"Drink it or I'll pour it on your lap."
"That's where it happened."
"I know it's the right decision."
"I've been thinking about this for a while."
"I give you everything I have."
"That night I had a dream."
"So who's tough?"
"You asked me what I wanted."
"It's good to have you with us."
"Are you sure he said that?"
"You always did what you wanted."
"If they have it, they can have you."
"And that's what you did."
"Do you see what I had to put up with?"
"I did it, didn't I?"
"The most important meal of the day."
"I had never told anyone."
"I have something outside to show you."
"Are you suggesting we go to a hotel?"
"Thank God we discovered it in time."

"What did you come to do?"
"He needs a helping hand."
"I love you and I want to marry you."
"Did you call my office to apologize?"
"This is what we are trying to understand."
"Is that why you're here?"
"What the hell is going on?"
"You spend a lot of time in the Zone."
"What made you leave?"
"He can tell us who framed us."
"My mother and brother are too."
"Do you have to park so close?"
"I am in the prime of life."
"I admire your notion of equal opportunity, sir."
"When was the last time you slept?"
"You are the most senior NCO."
"That's right, we didn't sign."
"Do you know the difference between you and me?"
"Is this the best angle on the court?"
"So what can I do?"
"I'm going to find a place for us to rest."
"They told me to go to Paris."
"What does that say about me?"

"Yes, all local police communications."
"A view of the street, like a passage."
"Do you know what I don't understand?"
"Generally, that's about it."
"This is what I'm supposed to do."
"But I have something to tell you."
"What are you doing here, man?"
"Are you waking me up to tell me about his vacation?"

"I'm glad to see you again too."
"They will wait for his return from the White Tower."
"It's a great place to raise children."
"What do you see when you close your eyes?"

"But you could still talk to me, right?"
"Yes, it will be three years since then."
"You will have your share, and even first."
"You went to Blake's funeral."
"What are they going to do to me?"
"Your friend who got in the car?"

"Their light takes so long to reach us."
"I would like to know what you think about it."
"Maybe he's a friend of hers."
"It turns out I like women."
"These are the names they gave themselves."
"Wait, what do you mean?"
"I know you feel the same way."
"What did they give you?"
"It looks like there's something."
"I live with my uncle and aunt."
"It's great to have a secret identity."
"We take the first job that comes along."

"What do I do with her?"
"I have a big favor to ask of you."
"I told you I would."
"Is it true or is it not true?"
"The other hanged himself in his cell."
"I may write for several newspapers."
"I hope that's not true."
"I always dreamed of having one."
"Are you sure it's yours?"
"I'll take care of it from now on."
"And he seemed to like it."

"Could you do this to my son?"
"This is where our conversation takes place."
"I must speak to the Jedi Council immediately."
"After everything he did to you?"
"I don't have time to wait."
"His body was found in the lab."
"Can you tell me what we're doing?"
"He's the guy we needed."
"Find me a flight. We're going to Langley."
"I need a bodyguard."
"If you keep looking at her like that."
"If we can adapt working hours."
"You know very well that it's not possible."
"Spider-Man on the front page, with a decent photo."
"There's always someone else."
"You were to stay on the command ship."
"I have to take this for now."
"Eight days in it is like a year."
"To reconstruct Katie's schedule."
"I have never been in a car."
"They are lucky to have you."
"Do you have time for a coffee?"
"What do you think will happen?"
"It's a pleasure to meet you, sir."
"Everything can be accomplished with technology."
"Are you working while we're in bed?"
"We can spot them by the way they bet."
"That's why you have to leave."
"I would be sorry to speak into the void."
"What happened to you is unfair."
"Thank you all for this wonderful evening."
"This is the tip of the iceberg."
"This is where Ray was brought."
"I hope you aren't."
"Is that all you want to know?"
"She picks up her husband at the airport."
"I brought you a little something."
"You know how everything works, except people."
"Vegas had never known a guy like him."
"How do you get a head in there?"
"I tell her I still want her."
"I can give it to whoever I want."
"Then I threw it in the Mystic."
"All the great actions of the Royal Guard."
"Nothing is more important than family."
"I only told you."
"Did she tell you who it was?"
"What does it matter now?"
"The bandages just came off this afternoon."
"No one remembers their early childhood."
"It's like I told the girls."
"You have to tell that to all the girls."
"It's him I want to talk to."
"Have I ever told you about my father?"
"Do you think you'll get me like that?"
"Did you send it to me?"
"You will become a Jedi, I promise you."
"I just took it back, that's all."
"And she wrote a book about it."
"I promised my wife a trip."
"Looks like we have visitors."
"They said you were on Mars."
"You will never see anything more real than me."
"I've never been so proud of myself."
"Like when a puppy shits on a carpet."
"I've seen this a million times."
"You haven't seen him for a long time?"
"And from the Shire, according to your speech."
"No, there is nothing to say."
"I even think I'm going to create some."
"That's very kind, but I'll get there."
"The book describes what I saw."
"Are you implying that I am the cause?"
"You talk, they think it's me."
"I couldn't come earlier."
"That's what he gave me."
"Sorry, that's all I have."
"It's more than I earn."
"I knew you had it in you."
"He will need you before the end."
"Don't venture into the shallows."
"We are perfect for each other."
"This city will never be the same again."
"What did I say again?"
"What happened at school?"
"And maybe I'll have a quickie."
"Here he is to the left of the man."
"So you've crossed the perimeter."
"Let's see what we have to do here."
"I hadn't planned any of this."
"Where will he fit best?"
"I wonder what he did."
"I would like you to do me a favor."
"No, I've never seen it before."
"Wait, what does that mean?"
"Do you even know what it is?"
"When did I do this?"
"For me, it's being with you."
"I reviewed all of its security settings."
"We are doing absolutely everything we can."
"How did you afford all that?"
"The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer."
"For Neil, when we're done here, call."
"You can come and sign the transfer document."
"He had the last word."
"You think I'm a good guy?"
"I know you're hiding something from me."
"Someone made the first move."
"And I realized it was you."
"Can we go, please?"
"That's how I saw it."
"Call me if there is any change."
"It's a story as old as time."
"I've never felt this way about anyone."
"I don't think so, I know it."
"It's like you don't exist."
"I know you don't like them."
"That's what I like about him."
"I have experience in this field."
"Did something happen between you?"
"You're part of my flock now."
"Do you feel that I see into your heart?"
"I thought you didn't like him."
"Try putting it on your head."
"I chose not to."
"What if I can't find it?"
"What do we expect from you?"
"I remind you that you are under oath."
"Nicky was the new big guy in Las Vegas."
"My wife gives them to me."
"What do you have for us?"
"And I'll be fine by this afternoon."
"I see what you're trying to do."
"It's a kind of high-tech prosthesis."
"I climbed to the top to hang myself."
"I received a letter from your wife."
"But especially for you, we started."
"When I saw him, I thought of you."
"Maybe he knows how to make the Romans disappear."
"And the analysis of vital parameters is excellent."
"I hope I will be up to it."
"For now, you give him a chance."
"Let him go or I'll slit your throat."
"What do you have to say about this?"
"But as a couple, you have to be happy together."
"This is the world we live in."
"The method is that they are good."
"And that's when it happened."
"In the wheel and dashboard."
"This is the best night of my life."
"A recent conversation comes to mind."
"He's leaving tomorrow and the girl with him."
"I'll tell you what to do and how."
"You'll tell me how it went."
"Don't you want me to take you?"
"Be smart, to get what you want."
"I'm doing this for him."
"Let a friend tell you."
"Everything you said was true."
"We found ourselves face to face, yes."
"Where did you learn to play like that?"
"I'm so glad you're okay."
"I did what I thought was right."
"For this purpose, we will form the square."
"I think I have the right to do so."
"The Emperor has a special plan for them."
"So you know what I did?"
"One of our chickens for one of yours."
"What makes you so sure?"
"Security check before changing zones."
"Let me go and I'll tell you."
"You were supposed to be home an hour ago."
"I think I'm in love with her."
"I'm glad we did that."
"My mother made them."
"It's like he's still talking to me."
"I was just about to call you."
"You will learn to use it like I did."
"Does this guy know what his daughter is going through?"
"I have some more questions for you."
"Not a soul knows him there."
"You can tell me whatever you want."
"Breathe fresh air again, my friend."
"She only does what she wants."
"I want to know what to expect."
"I say he wanted to feel normal."
"Dressed in the latest Roman fashion."
"I go there on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
"Especially since he got us the beers."
"I have a ton of things to do."
"Do you know what time he came home?"
"You act like nothing happened."
"Beyond government and police."
"The fate of humanity is at stake."
"Tell me what you know about her."
"I'm sure you'll find something."
"You must not tell him about me."
"What options do we have?"
"I promised I wouldn't."
"But my favorite Cuban is Ricky Ricardo."
"Tomorrow we will bring you back to life."
"What are we having for dinner?"
"No, I don't know where she is."
"I will find new ways to motivate them."
"Do you know of a place to rent around here?"
"I used to play there when I was your age."
"That's what you don't understand."
"He's the one putting pressure on you."
"How do you know if their protective field is working?"
"That's what you've always done."
"Your mother was with her at the end."
"The father will have to identify him at the morgue."
"You're still reading about orchids, I hope?"
"All I want is you."
"That's the last thing I would want."
"Did you understand what he said?"
"What's going to happen tonight?"
"There has to be something."
"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
"I have a visit to make with you."
"You've been lucky all week."
"I'm telling you this for the last time."
"I guess we'll never know."
"I'm sure it will go well."
"So this is the famous 'Book of Brothers'?"
"Put it back where you got it."
"That's what you're paid for."
"I just came to bring you the check."
"It's good to have you back."
"People come from all over to see him."
"I have the greatest respect for you."
"I thought I was going to faint."
"I'll take care of it from here."
"I quit years ago."
"I have to show the spectrum of the flower."
"I have some great news to tell you."
"Do your research and bring me his companions."
"I want to know everything you know."
"Maybe you can tell me who it is."
"This station will be operational on the scheduled date."
"I don't think anyone can say."
"Is it like a plant, in the earth?"
"I thought you would never arrive."
"In theory I agree with you."
"Did you see the state she's in?"
"You have to go through the proper channels."
"You're a genius, you're a genius."
"Did you see what she did?"
"What is he going to do with it?"
"Raise your right hand and repeat after me."
"What do you think is going on here?"
"What do you say, huh?"
"I'm here to tell you the truth."
"That's what we do there."
"I need to clear my head."
"And as they say, it's a new broom."
"I'm sorry, but it's the truth."
"That's not what interests me."
"Is there something I should know?"
"I have a score to settle with you."
"Are you sure about what you're saying?"
"It's going to be just like old times."
"It's fascinating, I make pornography."
"We came as soon as we knew."
"I have something you'll like."
"You have something to say, say it."
"What makes you believe that?"
"It's a bank account number."
"You could have told me you were coming."
"There are plenty of things to do."
"It's really the world upside down."
"Where did you learn to dance like that?"
"That's how it's played."
"There is only one possible explanation."
"He was like that all day."
"Please take me with you."
"She said she was going for a walk."
"But what do you know about it?"
"We wonder what we have done."
"Thanks, but I have to go to the airport."
"Who knows what the tide may bring?"
"She says I don't understand her."
"It takes us five years to train a legion."
"Is everyone okay at home?"
"A young man rang, asking for a phone call."
"I could accept my mother's promotion."
"Finally, what does that mean?"
"You look like you're in a cult."
"We were just talking about it."
"I wonder who will play my role."
"Well, what are we going to do?"
"He is abroad, for his work."
"What purpose is your soul occupied with?"
"Because that's who I am."
"Have your man call me for the exchange."
"I feel like I already know you."
"Was your father related to the Van Garretts?"
"You can look for it wherever you want."
"You didn't say the magic word."
"I decided we had to stay here."
"Will I ever be as fast as you?"
"They are very hardworking and will serve you well."
"How long can a whale stay underwater?"
"What made you change?"
"They put him in the back."
"You didn't tell him about us?"
"We also named some of your friends."
"Can I ask you a specific question?"
"And the father of the industrial military era."
"And what will you do with the big, big money?"
"Maybe I should have left it outside."
"Yes, that's what we're going to do."
"Yes, I know what that means."
"An FBI agent came to see me."
"We think this is their next move."
"That's what he was told."
"If that's really what you want."
"The women here always have been."
"Nothing is more important than the Expo."
"She came to us with a young physique."
"I know what I have to do now."
"So they had an accomplice on the inside?"
"I'll call you if I have any news."
"That's exactly what they're going to do."
"It's the best time of day."
"If you find it, it will be yours."
"But that's what I did."
"I thought we would have more time."
"You saw what you wanted to see."
"Bob found one in New Castle."
"This is where the driver installs."
"Tell me what you have in mind."
"The fact remains that you were shot."
"Yoda spoke of someone else."
"That's what he just said."
"I only need one thing."
"It never crossed my mind."
"We swear to serve the master of the Precious."
"He wanted Christmas to last all year round."
"Maybe something happened to him."
"She didn't say where she was going?"
"Maybe the machine isn't working."
"I came to ask your permission?"
"I think he had good reasons."
"What are you doing, buddy?"
"He's the one trying to take Aaron."
"Have you never taken a hot shower?"
"I heard what he said."
"Did you send him that check or not?"
"He is still the most gifted of the three."
"I thought it was next week."
"You'll have to do the honors for me."
"The car is in the name of Cindy Bradley."
"I know what people think of me."
"So, there had to be deaths."
"I told you to take care of it."
"To what do I owe the honor of this visit?"
"You will be used for inside surveillance."
"Not everyone can be smart."
"Do you want me to read you a story?"
"It's you I need."
"I thought you would be proud of me."
"Shouldn't you go back to bed?"
"Do you know what they did to me?"
"He's more machine than man."
"I know what you want to tell me."
"You haven't been to his apartment?"
"But let's take a look at building C."
"All gladiators in the training area."
"There's something for you below."
"I told him everything before the wedding."
"Go ahead, what do I say?"
"Is this how you have fun?"
"When was the last time we saw her?"
"Go see over there if I'm there."
"Will Phil see his shadow when he leaves?"
"You are the spitting image of your mother."
"We don't toast with water."
"Your father must be turning in his grave."
"He lived a thousand years ago."
"She will have to stay there until further notice."
"Then, and only then, will you be a Jedi."
"I've always had a soft spot for you."
"I don't remember it very well."
"I'll tell you what I'm talking about."
"You made yourself a new lightsaber."
"This is the only way to be sure."
"We both took stock."
"What else can I do for you?"
"I will come see her at my next rest."
"Now we are back where we were."
"I talk about this in Seduce and Destroy."
"I wonder what happened to them."
"Like the wizard who left it for you."
"That's what they told us."
"You are the best person I know."
"So she stays to take care of her."
"I'll tell you everything I know."
"My men are working as fast as they can."
"What brings you here, Mrs. Chan?"
"I had never seen her like this."
"Have you ever eaten fish heads?"
"There is still some good in him."
"But what is it doing there?"
"This is the best news of the day."
"What's in the boxes?"
"For everything I've done to you."
"Wait here and try to clear a path."
"Can you go home whenever you want?"
"I think I have to tell you."
"Your father and I are old friends."
"Put the same number in each muffin."
"Do you always do what you're told?"
"Your donations to our museum are very generous."
"I look up and down."
"Maybe it's my brain chemistry?"
"He asked me to tell you."
"I only saw him from behind."
"I have new workers arriving tomorrow."
"You will find what you need there."
"We have lots of things to tell each other."
"What do I have to do to prove it to you?"
"What were you doing in Delia's room?"
"What did she just say?"
"I don't need anyone else."
"You take Spider-Man's pictures, right?"
"Talk to Sonny and his two brothers."
"Of all colors, of all races."
"Please, I need to talk to him."
"He helps my father from time to time."
"That's all he can say."
"What's going through the tunnel?"
"I'll meet you here in half an hour."
"The museum director sends you a car."
"Have you thought that our guests will know?"
"You are now in the service of the Steward."
"And what do I have left?"
"Is your son-in-law given an important position?"
"I need a tough guy like you."
"Have you seen your son's work?"
"Christians dug centuries later."
"I used a personal transporter."
"No, I wasn't that lucky."
"Glad to see you enjoying this good wine."
"Both guys were put on trial."
"You are so smart to have seen it."
"Can we have the icon in bright blue?"
"I've never seen a funnier guy."
"It's because he was so smart."
"I think together we can solve it."
"Have you ever seen a baby do that?"
"Please do this for me."
"I had nothing better to do."
"Except I didn't."
"Don't tell me you're interested."
"I think it's the right decision."
"I put the pans in the box."
"Your mother called, she wants to see you."
"We're about to find out."
"A large sum, to count it in public."
"He sometimes assumed both personalities."
"What were you doing in the middle of the road?"
"Sorry, man, but you can't escape it."
"I am an old friend of the family."
"How long will he stay there?"
"It's a wonderful feeling to be 'cancelled'."
"You say people don't care."
"But what do you want to do?"
"One step closer to economic balance."
"This is the second to last piece to remove."
"They are children, but they are strong."
"So what is the nature of your business?"
"I swear you won't miss him anymore."
"Could you talk about the Chamber of Secrets?"
"What is the plan for extracting the prisoners?"
"I saw what came over him."
"He's two days ahead of you."
"I am everything you want to be."
"Yes, that's what I heard."
"Is that how you like it?"
"You seem fine to me."
"My parents did the same thing for years."
"I think it's the right time."
"This is the power supply for the glasses."
"I think you might be right."
"I was in the right place at the right time."
"Ginny has been talking about you all summer."
"Who says I'm not?"
"Do you know what I just saw?"
"Did he tell you he loved you?"
"We are on the other side of the mirror."
"You will make her a woman."
"I thought about you every day."
"No, there is no buffer."
"If you want to continue with me, just say so."
"I'll do it, I'll do it."
"No, they monitor what people read."
"She was like that all day."
"That's really all I have."
"I don't think there's anyone there."
"I'm going to be honest and tell him everything."
"I don't do fashion photography anymore."
"What do you miss the most?"
"I could have told you myself."
"You're the one pushing the envelope, Mel."
"I needed to talk to someone."
"I need you to do something."
"What the hell are you doing in there?"
"I believe everything you tell me."
"I was always one step behind Tyler."
"Get some strength for later."
"Mother, I thought we were going to be able to talk."
"That's up to me to decide."
"I also want to thank you for your idea."
"That's all I can promise."
"So what should we do?"
"I tell him we'll take two."
"That's what I thought at first."
"It was this girl who interrupted me."
"Did you know I teach middle school?"
"Perhaps the psychiatrist will get something out of this."
"You know very well who I'm talking about."
"She told me to give this to you."
"And also on Friday nights of tuberculosis."
"Are you sure it's this way?"
"I need you to come get me."
"That's the hardest part of this job."
"This cross belongs in a museum."
"He did everything, and even infinitely more."
"I'm telling you everything I know."
"And I feel like we're going to get along."
"But Mr. Perfect had better be polite."
"What kind of world is this, anyway?"
"Please don't touch me."
"That's what they're here for."
"What do you really want to do?"
"I felt out of place."
"No, I don't need you anymore."
"Any idea who could have done this?"
"You can come see us whenever you want."
"Did you see what happened to him?"
"I need a girls' night out."
"I just saw you on TV."
"I've never been able to choose."
"The photos were taken before their arrival."
"You should listen to your wife, she's right."
"It's good for what you have."
"You told me he was a bartender."
"We need a quarterback and a miracle."
"If you have to go, you have to go."
"Your name is not on the list."
"I knew a guy at school."
"Is it the same as last time?"
"What did I do with it?"
"He has a bull's head helmet."
"You will tell me what you think."
"This is the beginning of a long journey."
"I cross this bridge twice a day."
"I do what you told me."
"Don't you want to chat a little longer?"
"I decided to take it all on myself."
"I understand that you like music."
"You let your husband have a child with you."
"Just do what you have to do."
"It was my father who taught me."
"Before its beginnings and until the end."
"I can, but I don't."
"I have exactly what you need."
"Mr. Reactor accepted the modified core."
"No one stepped on his toes."
"These communists, they always tell you what to do."
"There are telephones in your rooms."
"There is one way to find out."
"That's how the world works."
"I don't know, but we'll find out."
"Haven't we already talked about this?"
"Maybe we are of the same race."
"You are indeed your father's daughter."
"I told him everything about you."
"It's time you left."
"Thank you for following this season with us."
"I'm sure you'll find a way."
"My apartment in Venice is at your disposal."
"Do you know the guy who created this?"
"Everyone in the region knows it."
"But we have no other plan."
"No, that's all I have."
"You told me 'Except for Mr. Shadow'."
"May I have my cigarettes, please?"
"I never had the chance."
"I need your voice on the Council."
"It's peace that scares me."
"But we pay people in the press."
"You turned your jacket inside out from the rope."
"I'm part of your imagination too, Joel."
"The girl was found in a toilet."
"Let's assume we enter the unit for nothing."
"Do you know what he did to her?"
"Tell me, what's going on?"
"I know how much you loved him."
"She was under illusions about my voice."
"How can you tell me such a thing?"
"I had several ideas this morning too."
"They almost won, by a yard."
"I know what people say about me."
"We have everything we need here."
"I wonder why I called you."
"I took this class at his school."
"Take the day off and come back on Monday dressed properly."
"What's on your finger?"
"What's wrong with your nose?"
"A clean office is an efficient office."
"He wanted to blame you."
"And back here tomorrow for lunch."
"I need you right away."
"Now the hand points to four minutes to midnight."
"What made you come back?"
"Donald, please open your eyes."
"I see a lot of courage around me."
"Can you tell him I called?"
"Did I go to bed earlier every night?"
"Look, it's from a king's palace."
"He might have some guys of his own."
"Ready to sacrifice himself for a good cause."
"To stick tubes in his parts."
"I think this is an excellent idea."
"You were saying how great it was."
"You see, that's what I was saying."
"We can do whatever we want with it."
"Maybe this is one of them."
"That's what it does to me."
"I need to make some space."
"Isn't that what attracts women?"
"I'll make sure we stay."
"God made man in his image."
"Do you remember how we got back here?"
"She can cash it in at the candy store."
"So we went to your house."
"A file is built on details."
"Aren't you a little late?"
"Gin, I have partners in the business."
"Let's see what they say about this one."
"Up, down, up, down."
"I know you will take care of me."
"I haven't heard from you."
"There are more coming."
"I have fond memories of this dog."
"Is that what it's all about, Manny?"
"I didn't ask for any of this."
"I also do Laurel and Hardy in Spanish."
"I want you to remember this moment."
"Did you tell him it was me?"
"I raised my daughter the American way."
"To say I was a nice guy."
"It's just a piece of wood."
"This is the best we have."
"There is an old-fashioned cabinet."
"Surprise yourself if you want to surprise your audience."
"I know what everyone is thinking."
"Are you sure you don't want anything?"
"I think you owe us an explanation."
"Jump in and stuff your big thing in there."
"I feel like I could love you here."
"And what do we do with these little fish?"
"I would have to ask my husband."
"I left literature and journalism."
"I would tell you if I knew."
"It won't happen again, I promise you."
"Since you brought dinner, let's eat it."
"Is it about you and me?"
"No one comes to see her anymore."
"And that's what we did."
"So what are you going to answer?"
"What else do we know?"
"No, you know what I mean."
"That's all I could do."
"You know, we were all proud of you."
"But you have to be exactly me."
"Now I have only one hope."
"We took the same dance class."
"Do you want me to give you one?"
"You think you're better than me, perhaps?"
"The Royal Ballet has had an excellent season."
"To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir?"
"He will go and get the Grail for us."
"You're the one who came to see me."
"You're here to cover my back."
"I was about to do it."
"Who are you to order me around?"
"I admire you and your beautiful wife."
"It is an important role in the Family."
"So what did it give?"
"You and I could do business."
"I was talking about your mother, your motel."
"There is a girl in the garden."
"I made the decision."
"You have something I need."
"My father helped him in his career."
"He disappeared a few years ago."
"What did he have to say?"
"There is enough to build a bank."
"This is exactly what he needs."
"But finally, what is going on?"
"Have you ever driven one of these things?"
"In our region, the environment is completely different."
"Actually, I know your work very well."
"It is against the laws of nature."
"But what can we do about it?"
"I received a letter the other day."
"I want you to make love to me."
"I'm just following his orders."
"He wants to thank you for inviting him."
"I have some questions to ask first."
"That's how I knew."
"But that's because of the baby."
"What could I possibly do?"
"It's because I'm a woman."
"One day she will say why she left."
"Thank you all for coming tonight."
"What do they call you at home?"
"Near the one you like the most."
"I must have a face that inspires confidence."
"It's to hear you better, my child."
"Things are happening that are beyond our control."
"I was caught in the rain all day."
"Everything you said is true."
"But on Saturday evening, we discovered something else."
"But that's how it works."
"She dreamed of seeing me at the Opera."
"Please have another glass."
"I just don't like it."
"I did everything to make it work."
"You have a whole room to yourself."
"There was water on the ground."
"I need to know what happened to him."
"Who says I need it?"
"And we went to dinner, right?"
"It looks like a real idea factory here."
"Maybe less, if I make a deal."
"There is a police car outside."
"Or we could focus on getting Doug back."
"I just wanted to say I'm sorry."
"He passed very close to my machine."
"Honestly, have you ever seen anything like this?"
"Now you and I can prevent that."
"I think I have it in me."
"The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."
"This is the cup of the King of Kings."
"She watched over you until dawn."
"Germany has declared war on the Joneses."
"You have very beautiful eyes, you know."
"I have a couple of things to sort out."
"I need some money."
"I've seen it hundreds of times."
"A child's life is at stake."
"You know you can count on me."
"I think I know what happened."
"Drive it and bring it back after the shot."
"It will take a little longer."
"What were you going to tell me?"
"Who will stay with you if I leave you?"
"No, he was definitely there."
"Do you think it's worth it?"
"He was the food industry terrorist."
"And what did I say?"
"Glad to see you in one piece."
"What do you think, Tony?"
"Your mother and I are old friends."
"What do I have to do?"
"I don't know, but it's ours."
"This is the third time this month."
"Tell me the number, please."
"Do you remember what the tablet said?"
"I was with a woman once."
"Who told you I was here?"
"Don't you see what he's doing?"
"You don't know me, but I do."
"I thought it was a good idea."
"So what am I doing here?"
"This will be the best moment of my day."
"Did you listen to what I said?"
"You're just a good-for-nothing."
"You were the one who came up with the idea."
"This is the only way to protect them."
"The second test is the Word of God."
"I just need to get some fresh air."
"Two types of talent in the same family."
"We have to stick together."
"I found the cable on the beach."
"You have a good sense of humor."
"How do we deal with this cop?"
"You're the one who's burning yourself, Gras-double."
"What makes it so special?"
"Any idea what it could be?"
"I'll tell you what we'll do."
"If that's it, I'll give it to you."
"No, my health does not allow it."
"What's not fair?"
"I did what seemed right to me."
"That's what the doctor said."
"I'll tell you what you are."
"All flights to L.A. are full."
"Except that 'you' doesn't mean anything anymore."
"Not sure this is a good idea."
"No, you're the one who's going to listen to me."
"This is what I want to talk to you about."
"I might have a job for you."
"I think so, but he's a good guy."
"Who else knows about this?"
"You fought to get transferred here."
"I've been thinking about this all day."
"Is it you or isn't it you?"
"I see you've thought about this a lot."
"Now tell me what happened."
"You never wanted my friendship."
"You told me not to move."
"No, that's not it either."
"She will give you the item after the concert."
"But what if it wasn't?"
"So he sent you in his place?"
"What the hell are you doing in your underwear?"
"Of course there is one."
"That's why I brought you here."
"Your father is much nicer than you."
"Are you referring to the background music?"
"Did I do the right thing by calling the clinic?"
"Or for there to be a collision."
"I told you we'd get there."
"Did I tell you to do your homework?"
"I know, but I changed my mind."
"He wanted to be loved by all voters."
"What are we supposed to see?"
"She was the one who came up with the idea."
"What's on the top floor?"
"Nobody will mistake us for a real band."
"She is always late on Monday mornings."
"He lets me know he's got me."
"It was to me that he came."
"Is this what happened?"
"You can be in Miami in five hours."
"They were the ones who came up with the idea."
"It only absorbs what strengthens it."
"Are we ambitious young people in the wind?"
"Everyone has something to hide."
"If you have any questions, come see me."
"I want you to stay here for a while."
"They are harming the wizarding world."
"This is the case for all machines."
"You were talking about a suitcase for all luggage?"
"She said it was an accident."
"Listen to what I have to say to you."
"We are stronger, faster, smarter."
"There is no happy ending."
"She must be in one of those cells."
"You know how to handle women."
"Nina and I apologize, come back."
"What's in the bags?"
"Luther, what can we do?"
"I think you are a beautiful couple."
"Haven't you read my resume?"
"Commissioner, what is this all about?"
"Where do they learn to drive?"
"Good God, what is this?"
"What if something had happened to Doug?"
"I have to finish what I started."
"I know what you're going to ask me."
"I give you everything you want."
"What the hell is he doing there?"
"We must become a person like everyone else."
"I could say I did it."
"All of you, I want to tell you something."
"But what are we doing here?"
"What are you going to give me?"
"You're the one who blocked the barrier."
"We have a riot in B wing."
"Everyone has a role to play."
"They come to us of their own free will."
"Would I ask you if I were married?"
"In my house, we are air signs."
"And that's what scares me."
"Tyrone, what did you do?"
"Everything is going as I planned."
"He was the best samurai in the empire."
"They were the ones who jumped on me."
"No, I didn't have time."
"Is this a good job, FBI agent?"
"But what was he thinking?"
"You mean he's from the future?"
"Do you know what the bell thinks about that?"
"Your guess is as good as mine."
"Don't tell me you're innocent."
"Harder than you can imagine."
"I told you we were together."
"Tonight he has to have fun."
"Find her a replacement and fulfill your contract."
"This is entirely within my competence."
"First, it is against the constitution."
"Most of them spoke easily."
"I do taxi work part-time."
"You wanted to see your father and the dog."
"I have one more favor to ask of you."
"You have to prove it and you will."
"About what happened to Uncle Ben."
"Did you want a ride home?"
"I've never seen so much money."
"I marry him because I love him."
"I'll take care of this myself."
"Okay, what's going on here?"
"I've never seen them in my life."
"That's how I got out."
"I hope you have a good lawyer."
"Brought to you by Mr. Tony, over there, you see?"
"My creation to launch and extend the fusion."
"I'm no angel either."
"I'm sure he knows something."
"Now you can see the true beauty of it."
"I'm just giving him a hand."
"You put me here."
"I didn't say goodbye to him."
"Because you are a good person."
"My God, what is happening to us?"
"You put it there."
"You opposed God, your Father."
"It happened a month ago."
"What is at stake here?"
"Omar tells me a lot of good things about you."
"I was asked to give this to you."
"No, please don't go."
"I reacted the same way when I arrived here."
"From takeoff to landing, we're together."
"What did you do with all my things?"
"What am I supposed to understand?"
"I want what I came for."
"Do you like the guy you're with?"
"They seem to be having a great time."
"That's exactly what they did."
"But I can lie down without a sound."
"I left an hour ago."
"I feel like his son as much as you do."
"What is this thing doing here?"
"I have to say I'm a fan."
"I remember she was screaming in the street."
"You know what you're doing, I hope."
"This is the hospital, about Linda."
"That's what I want to tell you."
"I served in the Marines, you know."
"I agree if you are."
"I thought you weren't talking to me anymore."
"If you think it's best."
"I'm friends with most of the customers."
"He provides you with everything you want."
"I'm glad to be able to say goodbye to you."
"You weren't allowed to speak?"
"I told you to go home."
"Otherwise, the guy is innocent."
"A legion of my best soldiers awaits him."
"That's my way of seeing things."
"I wonder what it's about."
"That's why it's going to work."
"Is this what we smoked yesterday?"
"But what are you telling me?"
"This film is inspired by a true story."
"I request permission to initiate research."
"I only ask one thing in return."
"Imprint of a revolver barrel above."
"It's such a pleasure to meet you."
"Whether you want to remember it or not."
"And you, what the hell are you doing?"
"He asked me to come and pick you up."
"What does it take to get your attention?"
"Who would send such a sum, if not the father?"
"Everything you say will stay between us."
"One of you would be on time."
"Do you think he lives like the natives?"
"I hope I didn't keep you waiting."
"And this shadow, do you know which one it is?"
"Can you describe what happened?"
"Do you live on Robin Hood Lane, the red door?"
"Get in the car, please."
"This guy is family first."
"No, we promised to wait here."
"It's an honor to have you here."
"I understood that my place was there."
"I'm the one asking the questions here."
"She never told me about you."
"It helps to give heart to the fight."
"What do you mean, the way I speak?"
"What did you two talk about?"
"It's a gift from my grandfather."
"It can be cured, but you have to want it."
"The book is on the dashboard."
"Any other week is fine with me."
"I was only able to neutralize one."
"You're the one who came looking for me."
"I just moved near you."
"I see that couples work much better."
"You want it to happen like this."
"Thank him for taking care of me."
"Yes, but I have to take care of them."
"I hope everyone is doing well."
"I'm the one who owes you an apology."
"We'll see who's the strongest."
"I have the contact, I have the contact."
"Mom, what are we going to do?"
"Who are you and where are you from?"
"Were you voted mother of the year?"
"At least we get a toaster."
"You don't work with rich widows anymore?"
"You and I are going to make the front page."
"We'll make sure you stay healed."
"She was asking for that, you know what I mean?"
"Let him present an invoice for his services."
"Is there anyone up there?"
"I would prefer you not to."
"You wouldn't have left without saying goodbye?"
"This tablet is one of those clues."
"Good, because I love them too."
"My father told me a lot about you."
"I said it was yours."
"We drink a coffee and leave."
"That's all they said."
"Then one morning he came to me."
"My angel, you need to rest."
"The master's soul ascended to heaven."
"You do everything I tell you."
"A gift, for the good of humanity."
"Boxing is a game of chess."
"What are you doing in the middle of nowhere?"
"Did they do this to you?"
"I need one with a student."
"What if he makes hay in the country?"
"We can do it, we can achieve it."
"Do you know what that makes you?"
"Would you be so kind as to let me pass?"
"She's not the one they want."
"You must feel the Force around you."
"My husband is the leader of the free world."
"What could possibly be eating away at him?"
"Until you get your sight."
"The best time is the weekend."
"What will it cost me?"
"I expected better from you."
"It's a great day for all of us."
"The officers are watching you to know what to do."
"I understand what the farmers have to go through."
"See you at the meeting point."
"Leave while you still can."
"I wish you had told me about it."
"He was a perfectly respectable man."
"Do you mind if I take a look?"
"We need to talk about all this."
"There's only you and me left."
"Do you think your boyfriend will like it?"
"I guess I'm lucky."
"No address, no phone, no money, no time."
"He taught you everything, didn't he, darling?"
"Do you understand what will have to happen?"
"My head is spinning a little."
"That's what we've always done."
"I'll tell you what he wants."
"You're going to fly to Las Vegas."
"I read the Young Deceased Handbook."
"I can't do that either."
"I know what she told me."
"I've never seen you around here."
"How do you get flowers like this?"
"Whatever is meant to happen to you, happens to you."
"I think I know what you mean."
"Did you hear what they said?"
"Should I turn each of you into a watch?"
"Who told you we were invited?"
"What else do you have in your pockets?"
"You're about to find out."
"If you want me to leave, just say so."
"Well, what was it?"
"Please, a little respect."
"From here, where do we go?"
"What do you guys want?"
"What's going on between us?"
"That's where I found her."
"He cut his daughter's hair."
"Mine gave me the big game."
"As if we knew what it was."
"Just one, in memory of the good old days."
"Do you think I'll let you do this?"
"I know everything you've done."
"This year has been like a dream."
"This kind of thing happens all the time."
"That's exactly what it means."
"I wish I could do something for you."
"Did you go to the hospital last night?"
"What do you think I'm trying to do?"
"Who gave me this feeling for God?"
"Did Edison sleep before turning on the light?"
"The last time I saw him."
"The Eagles are in the gallery network."
"I saw her as I see you."
"Tell him the stone is in the office."
"I see you care about this."
"Master, I have something to tell you."
"He wants me to train in Vegas."
"Do you know what you just said?"
"I got everything I wanted."
"Luckily, you have me, and the Deputy Minister."
"What drives you to cinema?"
"That's how he chooses them."
"We can't trust anyone anymore."
"I found out through the usual channels."
"I no longer have the strength to write."
"Is there something you like?"
"Give us the green light for your friend."
"She wasn't always like this."
"It would take more than two or three samurai."
"If we get lost, it'll be your party."
"That's all the time you'll have."
"Please, do not do that."
"Do you want to be his son's godfather?"
"You will have to tell me everything about my father."
"I need to get some driving done."
"Tell me what you expect from me."
"Then I'll go with someone else."
"I'm telling you, it's heaven."
"I bet yours is bigger."
"I go to school with your daughter."
"You will give life, you will take life."
"One at the lighthouse, the other on the roof."
"Do you have family in the United States?"
"No, I wouldn't want to do that this time."
"I always go to the movies for my birthday."
"This is what all the brothers think."
"I know something that most people don't."
"You're holding the end of that rope there."
"It's a bridesmaid dress."
"A king, a priest and a rich man."
"There is someone in my life."
"I have never loved someone so much."
"How about a nice restaurant with me?"
"The bulk of the troop must be there."
"You are Beaver and you are Red Bear."
"Have you seen the names on this list?"
"Yes, you're doing really well."
"You are either with us or with them."
"It's a Wednesday like any other."
"Do you want to be a sheep?"
"I knew we would pay for it one day."
"While he was alive, he cared about living."
"I think we just did it."
"I saw the gentleman in front of the room."
"She was supposed to drop them off at the bank on Friday."
"It says you have to work as a team."
"So I took the afternoon off."
"Can you turn the heat down a little?"
"I think I expressed myself badly."
"She goes out with me if her girlfriend comes."
"Wear pretty dresses, have boyfriends."
"Nobody said it was easy."
"I've known him longer than you."
"Haven't you had any migraines recently?"
"And what do you want to do?"
"Where is the Pat-on-the-Back robot?"
"Please let me join him."
"You should have told me you were coming."
"People will be willing to pay big bucks, right?"
"But it's not just him."
"What could have caused this?"
"It's good for business, he said."
"I've made my decision, make yours."
"Would you hold this, please."
"No, it's you who don't understand."
"I want you and your men to leave."
"You have to be there to know."
"I thought it was in my head."
"I will finish what I started."
"Important encounters often happen by chance."
"It will be the same if you don't go."
"She looks more Greek than Italian."
"Go see if the bridge has been cut."
"He will have the courage to do good."
"This must be the gentleman you've been waiting for."
"I come from an honorable samurai family."
"I heard him come in with you others."
"Was I different when you taught me?"
"Pass me my binoculars, please."
"He will be everyone's friend."
"The biggest you've ever had."
"Everyone needs a hobby."
"You'd better go see a psychiatrist."
"I'm glad to see you back on your feet."
"Tell him to put it on my tab."
"Your father is the man who disappeared."
"I have to see my father and his associates."
"You know it wasn't legal."
"Who among you has never sinned?"
"Who's really fucked now?"
"But what about Lawrence himself?"
"This is where we met."
"He thinks you're some kind of thief."
"What's so good about it?"
"Does he put food on the table for you?"
"We're going to have to do this the old-fashioned way."
"No, to her, if you don't mind."
"What is Mr. Mason's equipment?"
"We had to read throughout the entire film."
"Do you know what you're going to tell them?"
"I had the plan in my head."
"A little rest will do you good."
"Many great people have passed through here."
"Do you know you have beautiful eyes?"
"I have good reason to be."
"I'm the one who takes care of you."
"And even if he had eaten your friend."
"The map shows the exact location of the Grail."
"I can't tell him the truth."
"You have the right to hire a lawyer."
"You don't have any ray guns?"
"I'm a match for him."
"Now they're making a movie about his return."
"Make sure you're not being followed."
"She won't be back until tonight."
"Do you like getting fucked by the king?"
"What are they doing with us?"
"So who are you talking to?"
"They only do what they want."
"He can buy our N.O.C. list."
"You're the one in the ring."
"That's why I'm calling on you."
"I think it's worth it."
"One more thing we have in common."
"What fills me with joy?"
"I'm sure he has his reasons."
"Please don't go back there."
"You wanted to know what the Matrix is?"
"You were like a father to me."
"I remember his face in the rain."
"Don't pay attention, it's the cat."
"I learned to do this when I was a kid."
"Let's see what's in there."
"I have ice in my glass."
"A man can be whatever he wants."
"I have to find something honorable."
"Not with everything I've done."
"Because I rented the whole room."
"And what will be my role in all this?"
"I don't give you loads of them, do I?"
"She carries your greatest joy within her."
"I'll pay you next week, I promise."
"A man can do whatever he wants."
"A girl in bed who knows what she's doing."
"Please come home."
"Just tell us what happened."
"What do you want to do then?"
"Do you want to attack someone?"
"It's on the other side of this."
"And this ship allows you to go up there."
"What should I do next?"
"Sorry, did you do this?"
"What are our chances of getting out of here?"
"Do you agree to take this woman as your wife?"
"We have things to do for her."
"Do I have enough credit to buy you out?"
"For the first time, I enjoy it."
"I work, I eat, I have children."
"You haven't changed one bit."
"I'll make sure everything's okay."
"What are you doing here, Dad?"
"Do what you're told."
"Have you seen where the world is going?"
"They also say that you work miracles."
"I was told you left."
"Mr. Warren, check the bathroom."
"There's going to be some change around here."
"The first from my wife, who was leaving me."
"There are other movies to see."
"This is the life I chose."
"Are they from the hills or the West?"
"I said I'll take care of it."
"What's so interesting?"
"My mind played tricks on me too."
"You have to be very brave to name it."
"There may be hope."
"Yes, and a big stone in my bag."
"Happy to be the mother of little saints?"
"It is an endangered species."
"I know a spell to turn it yellow."
"I asked you what you were doing."
"This is where you have to start."
"That's what my father said."
"You tell me once, that's enough."
"Tackle someone your own size."
"How could you leave Dad for him?"
"She's dumber than I thought."
"What I'm doing."
"That was my grandmother's name."
"It is through you that he will do it."
"There was an impulse that pushed us."
"We can make this work."
"I am looking for someone."
"Where do you think I should take it?"
"You did well to tell me."
"It's beautiful here, isn't it?"
"She mustn't see me like this."
"You must not be involved in this."
"We all deserve a second chance."
"Because you sell to specific people."
"There's nothing to smile about."
"That's what I should have done."
"I will do you good, very good."
"Is this the movie you wanted to see?"
"You can ask for whatever you want."
"Because that's what I would do."
"Didn't you think you'd see the Martians one day?"
"I need you for a moment."
"The models we've never seen."
"That's what Billy Glenn would have done."
"Was that you on TV this morning?"
"And I take care of my mother."
"You are a great wizard, I assure you."
"I've seen this thousands of times."
"Show what you've got."
"That's right, you're right to leave."
"Do you have a plan to get out of here?"
"Give us back the money and take back your caravan."
"Now what are we going to do?"
"Sir, do you want to learn the 'Big Apple'?"
"Look at the size of this guy."
"All because people think we're cute."
"You never know what to expect."
"But you have to do something for me."
"This is all because of you."
"I want to farm the land, start a family."
"Did you put the stone in the briefcase?"
"This gear is the best of the best."
"Is that something you ate?"
"Everyone is with you, waiting for your signal."
"And when we have it, we will keep it."
"They don't make them like that anymore."
"What do you know about it, woman?"
"I know a bookmaker who will take bets."
"And to make it known to the whole world."
"What is the name of the gentleman you are waiting for?"
"I know he wouldn't mind."
"And that's all we have."
"They say a ship is coming this way."
"Maybe he can do something."
"He was the one who came up with the idea."
"How good it is to be so close."
"It looks like someone is there."
"Are you going to tell me what's going on?"
"I'm going to stay here and learn politics."
"They start arguing and yelling."
"Master, we knew it would be so."
"I didn't say anything to Mama."
"This is where God placed you."
"Three tall men are sitting in a room."
"There's enough for all of us."
"This is the love I need."
"You seem to know him well."
"What is he trying to do?"
"I must admit that I thought like them."
"Please put me through to the police."
"I'll put on some music for you."
"Boys' dormitory, upstairs, on your left."
"I told you to keep your distance."
"I think we are in the right place."
"Your mother won't arrive for another hour."
"No way you're bringing that thing here."
"How did everyone get drugged?"
"At least, that's what he thought."
"Will we ever see him again?"
"And every man needs something."
"Is this how you want to play?"
"He has a great sense of humor."
"Did you expect it to work?"
"We've done this thousands of times."
"That's how I know."
"He is one of those who follow him."
"What do you want me to take off my pants?"
"I'm going to see where that woman has gone."
"I said what I saw."
"Please open your eyes, Donald."
"I'm going to get him out of his house."
"Can I ask you one last time?"
"We are all one with work."
"Don't you have something to tell us?"
"You have to bring the tiger back anyway."
"Please draw me a sheep."
"Not that it matters."
"I saw that he wouldn't take them."
"I had to see this with my own eyes."
"No time to talk to students."
"I'll get to that after the war."
"I can't tell you about it now."
"I have the right to remain silent."
"See what he's hiding under his fingernails."
"His left hook is truly thunderous."
"Do you remember me from the taxi?"
"So I'll tell you everything at home."
"You just said you love me."
"Maybe we'll still get lucky."
"This is what everyone sees."
"What if I say the right thing?"
"I never know what to expect."
"It's just a friend's house."
"Making money in the name of the Lord."
"It's on the front page of every newspaper."
"All that remains is for us to pray."
"Succeed and you will get what you want."
"Find out everything you can about him."
"What do you mean, Dad?"
"Some are bigger than last year."

"Because of the seriousness of the situation."
"Did you put your name in the Cup?"

"Both are almost the same height."
"What if the gypsy knocks the other one out?"
"I'm going to take a little walk, it will wake me up."

"It's when we need it most."
"It was the only way I could get out of it."
"Because that's how it works."
"I found him a job in security."
"Something that's not on the menu."
"You followed me for so long and for what?"
"I thought it would be easier that way."
"What's in his mouth?"
"Excuse me, do you guys take checks?"
"I'll tell you when we find him."

"He deserves a beautiful funeral."
"I remember everything you said."
"You would have an idea of what it is."
"I never learned to listen to jazz."
"No, he is very clear on both points."
"Colonel, what can I offer you?"
"Maybe he has visitors too?"
"Some nice men would love a young girl like you."

"This is yours."
"Something is something."
"Yes I can."
"Good afternoon, gentlemen."
"Praise God."
"Thank you, very kind."
"Hello good morning."
"I already do."
"We've done it."
"He is my husband."
"You can't get in."
"Let it be quick."
"That explains it."
"For the car."
"What's it called?"
"Get us out of here."
"Here's something."
"Forgive me, please."
"Good morning, dad."
"Let's take a walk."
"You earned it."
"She is the best."
"Thank you very much, ma'am."
"You'll do well."
"Go for them."
"See you, friend."
"Lunchtime."
"Well, here we go."
"It will be another time."
"I've thought about it."
"That's tough."
"Mother of God."
"If I understand you."
"Yes, there it is."
"I'll think of something."
"It is very possible."
"You've done it."
"You can not pass."
"Good morning, guys."
"Come with us."
"Nobody will know."
"I did not know."
"I'm going to look for her."
"I couldn't tell you."
"At the moment."
"It is very beautiful."
"He better."
"Yes, we did."
"We'll find out soon enough."
"If required."
"Please, ma'am."
"Just look at that."
"I talked to him."
"Not again."
"Good luck, friend."
"Yes, see you."
"Nobody move."
"Well, that's enough."
"I didn't say it."
"We have plenty of time."
"It was me."
"It is very special."
"All right, son."
"Very well, son."
"It's been great."
"I'm going to pass."
"I believe him."
"That's over."
"There's something here."
"The truth is, yes."
"Oh, yeah, sure."
"It always is."
"It's the best."
"It's been good."
"Let's go for it."
"Keep her."
"Here I have it."
"Ah, how nice."
"This is better."
"I've decided."
"Now I see it."
"That's perfect."
"Last."
"We have to work."
"He's home."
"They don't understand it."
"It's easy to say."
"I saw it all."
"You are very clever."
"Everything is arranged."
"We are at peace."
"It's a good thing."
"I love you darling."
"I've seen them."
"Thanks for telling me."
"Something has happened."
"Same as always."
"I already tried it."
"People talk."
"Don't try it."
"That's impressive."
"To your posts."
"It's been fun."
"Good morning, Father."
"It's that way."
"I'll explain it to you."
"I love you a lot."
"Yes, I would."
"How nice to see you."
"It is the custom."
"I'm going right now."
"It could be important."
"Ah, I understand now."
"Not even a little."
"He is feeling well."
"Well, something like that."
"I'll go for him."
"Ah, here it is."
"You must be careful."
"You do it well."
"This will be fun."
"You already know."
"Okay honey."
"It could be fun."
"Good morning, Mom."
"As usual."
"Here you go, friend."
"This way, gentlemen."
"It's very early."
"See you then."
"Times change."
"It's my name."
"Cut the crap."
"This is new."
"I already said it."
"I can't look."
"It is very small."
"Not so fast."
"Yes, we will."
"And with good reason."
"It's very hard."
"It's going to work."
"We will stay here."
"Thanks my love."
"Come with daddy."
"I dare not."
"It's your house."
"I've noticed it."
"What was missing."
"Excuse me a second."
"Let's go see it."
"It's the last one."
"That was easy."
"She's mine."
"I feel fine."
"Well, that depends."
"Just go with the flow."
"You didn't know."
"It's my specialty."
"Ma'am, please."
"Come with mom."
"I have read it."
"Thanks for calling me."
"Good morning, ladies."
"I would like to go."
"I got it now."
"Don't even try it."
"I'll stay with you."
"Not for now."
"You have to calm down."
"Not anymore."
"If you like."
"Everyone is fine."
"Everything went well."
"Don't listen to her."
"Well, very well."
"I'm going to call."
"They are following us."
"It will be the best."
"It's very dark."
"Good night, mother."
"In the car."
"Well, of course."
"It seems to be fine."
"They're all here."
"You already did it."
"Good job, friend."
"Do you feel better?"
"Time passes."
"All right, listen up."
"Everything is there."
"Yes, the same one."
"It has been wonderful."
"That is confidential."
"Not by much."
"This is exciting."
"It will be a moment."
"Good morning, dear."
"I just know."
"Hi nice to meet you."
"I have checked it."
"You can't go."
"You'll have to do it."
"On the street."
"It's life."
"That can wait."
"It's been amazing."
"I love you, dad."
"This way, ma'am."
"Of course, ma'am."
"That would be good."
"I go first."
"And you too."
"At eight o'clock."
"To all of them."
"Now I must go."
"Yes, it seems so."
"Good night, father."
"I will, sir."
"You're doing it."
"Now it's yours."
"I want to see this."
"Well, see you later."
"In your house."
"A long time passed."
"Not right now."
"I talked to her."
"We will see each other again."
"I'm a girl."
"That was different."
"Go with God."
"It's the procedure."
"That's brilliant."
"All right, gentlemen."
"Oh yes, sir."
"Calm, calm, calm."
"At six."
"We must go now."
"I'll see you then."
"It was always like this."
"Well, you're right."
"You look very handsome."
"I'm just looking."
"Yes, there is."
"Count on that."
"Yes, I heard about it."
"Nothing to do with it."
"It's my family."
"It is very likely."
"Intruder alert."
"I don't like it."
"Yes, yes you can."
"You should know that by now."
"It's a bargain."
"At work."
"Think of something."
"To my office."
"I don't understand it."
"So it shall be."
"Go! Go! Go."
"I knew you'd come back."
"Enough games."
"It's a hunch."
"What good news."
"There she is."
"Be careful with him."
"Not likely."
"Yes, you're welcome."
"Yes, very nice."
"Yes, it will."
"Well done, boy."
"Let's wait."
"But he did it."
"Just look at you."
"I'm very excited."
"I need fresh air."
"You saw it."
"And so it shall be."
"I have seen him."
"Oh, here it is."
"It's a compliment."
"Not for me."
"And there it is."
"I order you."
"I'm going to call him."
"Come on, it'll be fun."
"Let me go with you."
"We'll make a deal."
"You know it well."
"This is fascinating."
"Yes that's how it is."
"It's our chance."
"Agree."
"I'll go for her."
"Yes, yes, sure."
"Yes, you do."
"Not available."
"I am your partner."
"It all makes sense."
"I can do this."
"Good morning, captain."
"It is very true."
"Let there be three."
"Verbatim."
"I've got it under control."
"Yes, I'll be fine."
"We can do this."
"I'm going to call her."
"I'll wait for you here."
"It will be all right."
"It's my favorite."
"This is big."
"He is my partner."
"He has been shot."
"You already know her."
"I will come back later."
"I love that."
"All right, folks."
"They are good guys."
"That might work."
"It's coming towards us."
"I can't imagine it."
"I just came in."
"I tell the truth."
"Ask her."
"Yes, I do care."
"I'm your sister."
"We stayed here."
"But now yes."
"They are calling us."
"It's your chance."
"That's how he is."
"It's war."
"I must go now."
"Try a little."
"You can be sure."
"Thanks very much buddy."
"I've done it."
"Come here, boy."
"That won't work."
"Show time."
"Please open up."
"What a good dog."
"I'm sure you can."
"Good morning, boss."
"He's my nephew."
"Whatever you need."
"Oh excellent."
"We're fine, thank you."
"I mean, yeah."
"This is me."
"Honey, it's okay."
"I've already seen them."
"He is very clever."
"That's funny."
"Over time."
"Me too, darling."
"It's my thing."
"I'm sorry love."
"Whatever."
"I'm going to win."
"But he will."
"We can do that."
"I'm here with you."
"Look who arrived."
"Thanks, I will."
"It's the last straw."
"He is my patient."
"Don't be a killjoy."
"Give me the briefcase."
"Oh, that's right."
"It's the tradition."
"I do know."
"It's an opportunity."
"We will do one thing."
"I'll teach you something."
"That's sweet."
"I never saw it."
"You are very smart."
"I never did."
"All right, let's do it."
"Very well, dear."
"Thanks for saying that."
"He came in and out."
"Most of it."
"In the field."
"Wait a bit."
"Well, it's true."
"Anywhere."
"I can't walk."
"You've been great."
"Call me when you arrive."
"There's one."
"You know it perfectly well."
"Yes, here we are."
"You did this."
"He is his father."
"Take him away from here."
"It's cold outside."
"Give me the shotgun."
"It's my home."
"All rise."
"Honey, come here."
"I am leaving tomorrow."
"The more, the merrier."
"Good morning, madam."
"Good evening, captain."
"I'll leave it here."
"They have seen us."
"It always was."
"Name and number."
"She is good."
"You know who I am."
"I love you, mommy."
"Then I'm leaving."
"At seven."
"That's excellent."
"This is nice."
"It is very common."
"In the city."
"There's something there."
"I love her."
"Let's go shopping."
"For God's sake."
"I won't say it."
"I'm so sorry."
"I'll be leaving soon."
"At the table."
"What a good boy."
"Something's going on here."
"In the church."
"That will be fine."
"Of course, dear."
"I accept the bet."
"They are my parents."
"It can be fixed."
"I didn't understand it."
"This is good."
"This is delicious."
"I came to look for you."
"Make your decision."
"That sounds fun."
"I'm in position."
"It won't be like that."
"I know what it's like."
"It's a hottie."
"Don't pay attention."
"Good night, sweetheart."
"Mind your language."
"But here we are."
"Yes, it is wonderful."
"I would love to go."
"How sweet you are."
"You already know him."
"I am very sick."
"At nine o'clock."
"Let's go find her."
"I'm fine, sir."
"It's been fantastic."
"I must do something."
"Here she is."
"It's because of me."
"This is life."
"Thank heavens."
"I propose something to you."
"I'm with him."
"Then come with me."
"Good morning, friends."
"I didn't expect it."
"I'm a genius."
"You're going too far."
"I'll go home."
"It's my own."
"I have a proposal."
"It's a good sign."
"What a beautiful name."
"Yes, this is it."
"I don't believe them."
"It's my treasure."
"Go over there."
"To school."
"Better for you."
"You look fabulous."
"I'm doing great."
"Good morning, friend."
"It was very easy."
"Not even a little bit."
"Here it is all."
"I already have them."
"That was beautiful."
"I never saw her."
"By the skin of its teeth."
"I earned it."
"All right, ma'am."
"Well, we're leaving."
"Goodbye, old friend."
"I'm sorry, honey."
"Stop, stop, stop."
"That's what I'm getting at."
"I heard it before."
"Hold on a bit."
"You never do."
"Yes, I'll try."
"It's a celebration."
"Okay, see you."
"See you, guys."
"Now we are talking."
"Now to sleep."
"They better."
"Yes, yes I can."
"It's our secret."
"Hi my love."
"I arrived first."
"And you did."
"To the street."
"Don't even mention it."
"I clean it."
"Man and wife."
"Come, come here."
"Captain's diary."
"Up, up, up."
"I have my moments."
"You always were."
"Yes, that sounds good."
"It certainly is."
"I'm going to start."
"It was very fast."
"Please try again."
"Grab your things."
"Get out of the way."
"Just a moment, friend."
"All those things."
"So, deal."
"That's us."
"Let's go, please."
"That's fair."
"She is not here."
"Yes, it is beautiful."
"For friendship."
"You've been drinking."
"It was right here."
"Very kind, thank you."
"He had it all."
"A bit better."
"Yes, it can."
"Let's go and see."
"Well, I will."
"You have one minute."
"But you will."
"Bedtime."
"I have to rest."
"It's a legend."
"I love you, brother."
"It is very old."
"He will do well."
"Thanks, you too."
"Hey, look at that."
"Yes, it's fun."
"We'll have a good time."
"Be well."
"I get it now."
"I did this."
"Let's continue."
"This is fabulous."
"It doesn't show."
"You're sweet."
"It's a big deal."
"More, please."
"Name, please."
"Let's rest."
"Good morning, Mr."
"Look, there it is."
"It's out there."
"We'll think of something."
"Be careful when going down."
"I already thought about it."
"It's up to her."
"I'm looking for it."
"There is a full moon."
"I'm going to tell him."
"Let's do one thing."
"I'll be watching you."
"I'm safe."
"It's a beauty."
"I won't do it."
"You must eat something."
"In construction."
"Good night, friend."
"See you later, friend."
"I was hoping you'd come."
"In the air."
"Only God knows."
"It's a saying."
"You know what."
"None at all."
"The second moon."
"This is private."
"Oh, I understand now."
"I think it's fine."
"Here we have it."
"Here's my card."
"We are all equal."
"He seemed to be fine."
"Yes, they will."
"That's comforting."
"They're coming here."
"Just one more."
"I'm over it."
"All right, then."
"Put your hand down."
"Go and have fun."
"They are like children."
"That's unfair."
"He deserves this."
"You can't get out."
"I don't know, friend."
"That's it, boy."
"Take off the handcuffs."
"All right, kid."
"All right, boy."
"Let him keep talking."
"You have to leave it."
"More for me."
"At five o'clock."
"Observe and learn."
"Sends you greetings."
"At night."
"Give him a kiss."
"I'm going after him."
"To the city."
"You're very attractive."
"Keep it a secret."
"I love you, friend."
"Stop the car."
"It can't wait."
"At ten o'clock."
"It's my case."
"Let's go ahead."
"I will, thank you."
"Today is Saturday."
"Come with mommy."
"It's a business."
"I say nothing."
"We are having fun."
"Everything remains the same."
"It's a challenge."
"Yes I do."
"You and I."
"That was yesterday."
"You've been busy."
"Good night, love."
"It's in here."
"Waiting."
"All to starboard."
"Please, friend."
"I love you, daddy."
"Thanks for watching."
"Give me the flashlight."
"It's my car."
"But not today."
"You can't speak."
"That's what it was called."
"I never was."
"See you, Dad."
"I think I'll pass."
"I'm up here."
"We all have it."
"How is that?"
"He's not responding."
"Good night, grandpa."
"I know, son."
"That will never happen."
"Ask for you."
"That's mine."
"Go wash up."
"I prefer not to say."
"Take the test."
"I have a commitment."
"Good morning, children."
"You must go now."
"Something has come up."
"Let's try."
"I'll see you outside."
"And a horn."
"Department of Mysteries."
"I want to too."
"It's like you."
"And for you."
"It wasn't there."
"You've been lucky."
"All set, sir."
"Not so high."
"I'm used to it now."
"I'll leave you here."
"To his house."
"That's right, ma'am."
"Yes, I love her."
"Please, son."
"He couldn't come."
"Feel my heart."
"At full speed."
"He's always late."
"Look who came."
"That's private."
"I have plenty of time."
"I already saw you."
"See you upstairs."
"Now it's better."
"We all saw it."
"I know the feeling."
"It is very deep."
"Please do so."
"Nobody can do it."
"That's what we're working on."
"You know it."
"Come on, I got you."
"I'll go right now."
"Please respond."
"How clever you are."
"And so it begins."
"It's a tomb."
"He's a sweetheart."
"It will be a minute."
"And this too."
"You have to know."
"I've already decided."
"We always do."
"Go fly."
"Take care of your mouth."
"The next day."
"We have achieved it."
"I already found out."
"It's a clue."
"You will pay for this."
"I'm fine darling."
"How beautiful you are."
"It's an experiment."
"Don't go in there."
"He has good intentions."
"That's what I'm doing."
"To the kitchen."
"Calm down a bit."
"She's so cute."
"I've been shot."
"Now I'm with you."
"Let's check it out."
"Nobody will find out."
"I'm going to look for them."
"That's it, honey."
"It is very calm."
"I'm a vampire."
"It is not appropriate."
"You can do this."
"Wow, look at that."
"Please, guys."
"I can't today."
"That's enough for today."
"Enough for today."
"It's a lot of responsibility."
"It's paradise."
"You're welcome, honey."
"She's a doll."
"They are my children."
"It was fate."
"Good morning, Sergeant."
"All right, look."
"Quick, quick, quick."
"It will be here soon."
"He is the only one."
"Yes, we'll see."
"To their places."
"You don't want to do it."
"That's her."
"You have it all."
"Not even to her."
"I'm sorry, mother."
"It's my phone."
"We have to continue."
"This one here."
"For the children."
"Fine by me."
"Table for two."
"It's a plane."
"It's something special."
"That was wonderful."
"Because it's fun."
"I've been lucky."
"You have a date."
"That was impressive."
"It is very comfortable."
"We have a match."
"You shouldn't do it."
"We can solve this."
"Just a moment ago."
"He's playing with you."
"Yes, that way."
"He's laughing."
"Everyone left."
"Let's get to it."
"In many things."
"It's my gift."
"Lifetime."
"You again."
"The two of us alone."
"Grab your coat."
"On target."
"Time to work."
"I'm happy here."
"That's fabulous."
"It has been beautiful."
"Go that way."
"He's doing it."
"Thanks for taking me."
"I always loved you."
"Today is Thursday."
"Mother, please."
"Don't you believe it?"
"Suppertime."
"Come on, give me that hand."
"I like reading."
"For a price."
"I liked that."
"That one over there."
"They are moving."
"Get rid of that."
"Give me a little kiss."
"Good job, kid."
"And to you."
"That's what it's there for."
"For a short time."
"Buy yourself something nice."
"It is our destiny."
"Be careful, honey."
"In the lake."
"Give it a minute."
"Lift up your shirt."
"They're leaving now."
"News travels fast."
"No one should know."
"There has to be one."
"All right, people."
"Today is Friday."
"Wow, look at this."
"Not by chance."
"There's another one."
"To the station."
"On the floor."
"Come here, friend."
"That went well."
"Here you go, boys."
"I have to prepare myself."
"Thereafter."
"It is very valuable."
"Well, that makes sense."
"Good morning, princess."
"Happy birthday, dad."
"That's right, my friend."
"This is so."
"I'm pretty sure."
"I'm almost sure."
"He has to come."
"Good luck tomorrow."
"Good job, honey."
"I'll go with him."
"It's the rule."
"Enough jokes."
"On to the next step."
"All the best."
"The old days."
"You already knew it."
"It's underway."
"How kind you are."
"Things changed."
"That was fantastic."
"He will never succeed."
"At all hours."
"I'm here, baby."
"And so does he."
"End of the story."
"It's just beginning."
"Someone like me."
"How good you are."
"Orders from above."
"A little strong."
"At four o'clock."
"Let it be clear."
"That is possible."
"Let's get on with it."
"Name and surname."
"Suitable for work."
"Of course I'll go."
"He won't do anything."
"Your mom called."
"Just like before."
"Keep at it."
"Let's make a toast."
"Go up the stairs."
"Go see it."
"It's my baby."
"And for me."
"Give me the coat."
"All right, let's get started."
"And why?"
"How have you been?"
"To the beach."
"We arrived on time."
"Just did it."
"Goodbye for now."
"Let's rehearse."
"It's so wonderful."
"I'll ask you something."
"You are among friends."
"It's still here."
"Think about this."
"That's big."
"I'm busy now."
"That's it, my friend."
"She is there."
"Pay your taxes."
"Three o'clock."
"Hello good evening."
"We have been lucky."
"How lucky he is."
"Let's go to the car."
"One more second."
"Look at the path."
"It runs in the family."
"To the office."
"It's a rock."
"Come here, come."
"That can be fixed."
"You seem to be fine."
"I miss him so much."
"It's the future."
"I'll teach you."
"Sorry for the delay."
"It had to be."
"I'll go to the bathroom."
"I'll make a call."
"This might work."
"It's a tie."
"Or maybe yes."
"It's so obvious."
"It is very impressive."
"It's nearby."
"They are attacking us."
"Give me the ring."
"It's me, honey."
"Give me the bat."
"Yes, it's clear."
"Here, hold this."
"Thanks for helping."
"I'll do it right."
"It's done like this."
"I'd rather not."
"I don't need to do it."
"It's in Latin."
"Keep this in mind."
"Look, I have to go."
"Lights, please."
"I'm going to ask."
"That would be me."
"This is love."
"Please excuse me."
"Come see it."
"That takes time."
"Things happen."
"Yes, it's good."
"In a while."
"Okay, here I go."
"Don't open them."
"Nobody will do it."
"So go away."
"I received your note."
"Please allow me."
"Oh, how nice."
"Not now, thanks."
"We'll do it ourselves."
"Don't come back late."
"They did the right thing."
"I love her very much."
"Don't feel sorry for it."
"To the charge."
"And guess what."
"I'll have a beer."
"It's reality."
"My warrior woman."
"He is a psychopath."
"I remember well."
"I'll call the doctor."
"So be careful."
"We will have a lot of fun."
"They already did it."
"Inside me."
"Ho, ho, ho."
"Stop for a moment."
"In the head."
"They have to do it."
"Wow, what a surprise."
"We are fine here."
"I will open the door."
"I want to do it right."
"And you know what?"
"It's OK love."
"Don't look at him."
"My old ring."
"We'll be leaving soon."
"It looks amazing."
"Father, please."
"Let's toast."
"We'll start over."
"The good times."
"It's a blessing."
"Come for me."
"Key, please."
"Give me that five."
"I was looking for it."
"The first time."
"Back, back, back."
"I'm going to give myself up."
"I have an announcement."
"Thanks for staying."
"It's okay, sweetheart."
"And I would."
"That's classified."
"Precisely for that reason."
"Because of me."
"Come for him."
"Of the two."
"Go your way."
"Thanks, see you later."
"I feel happy."
"In the cemetery."
"He's been here."
"I don't believe it."
"To your house."
"Same story."
"I'm his uncle."
"You've arrived late."
"Stretch your arms out."
"He does it well."
"Here, use this."
"Take your book."
"They will pay for this."
"Good morning, class."
"I feel the same."
"Happy birthday, sir."
"All units."
"It's your dad."
"What did he say to you?"
"We are moving."
"You don't need that."
"Lift your tongue."
"There is much more."
"Excellent choice, sir."
"I'm coming to get you."
"In a certain sense."
"It's your family."
"Don't be in a hurry."
"Take care of this."
"He is very happy."
"I know, dear."
"Just a moment, dear."
"I'll go see her."
"It would be good for me."
"I've been waiting."
"Let's jump."
"It will go well for you."
"That's fascinating."
"It's the smell."
"You have my sword."
"I have discovered something."
"I won't leave him."
"We have to jump."
"It's the job."
"In the market."
"I'll leave tomorrow."
"It will be a second."
"It's my book."
"All right, wait."
"What a nice car."
"It's my leg."
"I wish it were so."
"He already said it."
"Oh yeah, sure."
"Let me get this straight."
"Mine doesn't."
"This is sensational."
"Guess who I am."
"Give me a towel."
"How hot it is."
"We already have them."
"Yes, yes I have."
"Take off my handcuffs."
"He has a lot of money."
"Ah, here you are."
"Time for lunch."
"In the refrigerator."
"Like a year."
"Don't be like that."
"You're very good-looking."
"I loved you very much."
"It is not seen."
"He's mine."
"Very well, Colonel."
"Okay, Colonel."
"A big fish."
"Let it be double."
"See you later, friends."
"Authorization, please."
"A great day."
"Here he is."
"You never did."
"Closing time."
"I've been practicing."
"Name and profession."
"I'm very hot."
"It's not going well."
"Keep it safe."
"Give us a second."
"That was a good one."
"You know my name."
"I had a date."
"You're not going."
"Oh, good Lord."
"I have to attend."
"Someone was here."
"He is in very serious condition."
"Look at this photo."
"I had to try it."
"I feel honored."
"At his disposal."
"You look very elegant."
"We have to act."
"Act like it."
"I made some calls."
"Then I will."
"On the outskirts."
"He's so young."
"Sure, that's fine."
"It is very relaxing."
"But it is important."
"Both of them together."
"This is history."
"Yes, I forgot."
"At their posts."
"So we're good."
"Very good year."
"We're all here now."
"She's your wife."
"Those were different times."
"Don't think that."
"You are the man."
"You'll get your money."
"You are very close."
"They're up to something."
"It's very windy."
"What a nice suit."
"Please, brother."
"They make a good couple."
"It needs a lot of work."
"Please reply."
"I can't know."
"Of course it counts."
"I have your address."
"It's a private thing."
"Leave the bottle."
"Better than nothing."
"I'm already gone."
"There are many possibilities."
"For freedom."
"It was very dark."
"That didn't work."
"We'll see now."
"We will leave together."
"I always will."
"Seven of Nine."
"You're my girl."
"He is immortal."
"I never have any luck."
"It is very soft."
"Nobody can know."
"It's the regulation."
"This is huge."
"Yes, in person."
"I had to go back."
"Mark my words."
"I like them a lot."
"I'll bring her."
"Safely."
"A perfect day."
"I'll go look."
"Everyone says so."
"Boys, boys, boys."
"I would love to see it."
"On the walls."
"Today is Tuesday."
"She is his wife."
"Let's get it."
"It is very serious."
"Round trip."
"At the gym."
"It's about to happen."
"It has some marks."
"What I thought."
"Yes, here they are."
"You've taken a long time."
"Give me that hand."
"I'll sit here."
"One step back."
"Make the arrangements."
"You're going to win."
"At some point."
"End of the program."
"It's a beginning."
"He is from France."
"Maybe another day."
"Arrived this morning."
"Hey, check this out."
"Besides that."
"It's a broom."
"Work, work, work."
"Yes, good, good."
"Don't be a pain."
"One after another."
"I have to get it."
"I can't drive."
"Hello, old friend."
"I'm with you."
"He will stay here."
"It's something new."
"Thanks to both of you."
"Come, I'll show you."
"I have to pack."
"Yes, good morning."
"How cold it is."
"Come here with me."
"Until Wednesday."
"We are good friends."
"I'm coming to you."
"It's a watch."
"Not until tomorrow."
"This is as far as we go."
"Like a virgin."
"I'm so proud."
"Nobody will notice."
"At the same time."
"We will take a walk."
"For me too."
"Come for dinner."
"All around us."
"Move the car."
"How's everything going?"
"A great party."
"It's my dream."
"I just left."
"Or it was."
"Look at mom."
"I'm taking this."
"They know the rules."
"I'm with someone."
"Look at these photos."
"Out, out, out."
"It's my face."
"All right, Father."
"I know that place."
"It's the cat."
"Don't start with me."
"Well, look at this."
"I am very satisfied."
"You owe it to him."
"Now you're talking."
"It is very tasty."
"Let's drop the subject."
"Documents, please."
"It's his name."
"It's the money."
"It's an emergency."
"I pay for it."
"Just one day."
"Bring a chair."
"She is very clever."
"You are a beast."
"You're a rookie."
"Good morning love."
"They are going very well."
"I'm on him."
"No doubt, sir."
"Good morning, girls."
"It's my heart."
"See you later, officer."
"Iron head?"
"It is very safe."
"What a good question."
"It's ancient history."
"Upwind."
"That's what I'm here for."
"Nothing of importance."
"I'm going for them."
"This way, boys."
"Wait a minute, guys."
"I'm your boss."
"I knew it was coming."
"One and two."
"Let it be put on."
"Daddy is here."
"Get out right now."
"Do something useful."
"Yes, it will be better."
"It's my arm."
"This time yes."
"Cleaning service."
"Yes, it will be fun."
"I'll close the door."
"Think, think, think."
"It's a setup."
"I'll go right away."
"Maybe I can."
"I find it incredible."
"It's coming out now."
"I need that phone."
"I'm your dad."
"I love you, too."
"Look, I don't know."
"I hope to see you soon."
"Give me the pleasure."
"You are a dog."
"It has its moments."
"Three, please."
"They are going to enter."
"A fair exchange."
"It has to disappear."
"Yes, as you wish."
"You are so good."
"Or to her."
"Whatever your name is."
"I'll go myself."
"He is a politician."
"They have done it."
"You're going to go."
"All right, Mom."
"It is not necessary."
"Sure, sure, sure."
"Well, hurry up."
"I never got married."
"How is it possible?"
"It is confidential information."
"I've been here."
"Does this seem okay to you?"
"I'm sorry, sister."
"This is magnificent."
"Nothing like this."
"Good evening, Sir."
"Give me the wallet."
"It's my room."
"It's my opinion."
"I already know him."
"I just moved."
"Go towards her."
"Yes, they are here."
"Vehicle to Explorer."
"Yes, it was there."
"I see your mind."
"It doesn't cost anything."
"I can do it all."
"You're a baby."
"It's a moment."
"I have to practice."
"Give me the sword."
"Here, here, here."
"It's a letter."
"Get it going."
"Now we are together."
"Get it out of there."
"Oh, my head."
"It was your father."
"I want you back."
"Nobody will believe him."
"I already noticed it."
"Nothing here."
"Good morning, professor."
"It looks better."
"This is hard."
"Women's things."
"A brave man."
"Yes, many times."
"Ah, good morning."
"I could go with you."
"At full power."
"I'll go for one."
"I would like to do it."
"In the afternoon."
"You fought bravely."
"Please come closer."
"At twelve o'clock."
"It looked good."
"Oh, I will."
"Yes you do care."
"See you, darling."
"It's for today."
"I look good."
"I hope he wins."
"I didn't plan it."
"Very well, like that."
"You don't say anything."
"That's what I figured."
"Everyone leaves."
"Now you are with me."
"Nobody understands it."
"I love you all very much."
"It felt good."
"Come on, come on, come on."
"To your father."
"That's a new one."
"Give me your watch."
"Good morning, uncle."
"Just stay here."
"Marry her."
"You won't do anything."
"I don't follow him."
"Yes, it was fun."
"You were a father."
"Back up."
"It's quite big."
"You know something."
"I have to go down."
"We have to eat."
"Whiskey, please."
"Hurry up, please."
"How dare you."
"On the shoulder."
"Yes, we're leaving."
"I always have it."
"I'm going to land."
"It's my office."
"I didn't believe him."
"It's very bright."
"Take her out of here."
"Bounty hunters."
"You're going to live."
"We already have him."
"You are a beauty."
"He's doing something."
"It was coming."
"I have to make sure."
"Yes, I'll be there."
"I look like a bride."
"It's the sign."
"Good night, mommy."
"How pretty you look."
"I want mine."
"Like a week."
"Fine, I'm fine."
"Have a good one."
"All afternoon."
"Well, it is possible."
"To their positions."
"Please move aside."
"It's water under the bridge."
"Get on the truck."
"Use your arms."
"Let's have breakfast."
"Increasingly."
"I built it."
"You're my man."
"Of course, my love."
"A car is coming."
"Welcome to the program."
"Thank you, my God."
"Yes, he speaks."
"It hasn't arrived yet."
"Of course they can."
"Thank you very, very much."
"Wait, here it is."
"We're going to make it."
"Police Department."
"It's your car."
"Please leave me alone."
"Okay, dear."
"That's what I came for."
"You are looking for it."
"Grab the rope."
"Yes, it makes sense."
"That's serious."
"It is very delicate."
"What a nice dress."
"You are very special."
"I know, friend."
"It's pretty obvious."
"Praise be to Allah."
"And they were screaming."
"This did not happen."
"Okay, Captain."
"You're very late."
"Yes, it is better."
"Not a clue."
"You received my message."
"That's how he was."
"I want your name."
"Hundreds of them."
"It is a custom."
"Everything, except this."
"Documentation, please."
"Wow, thank you very much."
"I play with these."
"We keep it hidden."
"I am your woman."
"They will have to leave."
"We have to go up."
"I am his servant."
"It might be helpful."
"I'll wait."
"I see it."
"Say goodnight."
"We will arrive on time."
"I've been thinking about it."
"Seven and a half."
"My own Jesus Christ."
"That changes everything."
"Well, I give up."
"Good luck, dad."
"I don't expect anything."
"They were very kind."
"Now you can go."
"Maintain order."
"Like water."
"I'll be home."
"He's very cute."
"I'll do it quickly."
"Good morning, my lord."
"Clear the way."
"That's a secret."
"I was just looking."
"Your hair changed."
"I'm always here."
"You guys stay here."
"That's what it says here."
"Guess who it is."
"He's trying."
"Don't believe him."
"You don't remember."
"Stop messing around."
"He has done well."
"All right, dear."
"They always are."
"It's been tough."
"Just a minute, boss."
"Since recently."
"It's my love."
"Short and sweet."
"Wait a minute, Mom."
"They had their time."
"I can't do it."
"As you can see."
"About ten minutes."
"I call."
"Not even that."
"Bring the camera."
"Wow, that's great."
"It's a pain."
"That is known."
"Put on your clothes."
"It is very high."
"And you don't."
"Oh, God, yes."
"I'm going to fix it."
"No one you know."
"It's so big."
"You're a faggot."
"You've gone too far."
"I need to show you something."
"Look how you are."
"But I must go."
"Come here, let's go."
"It's down here."
"He likes you a lot."
"Give us a kiss."
"I will touch the sky."
"Champagne, please."
"I'm sorry about what happened."
"He's only human."
"But you're out."
"This is easy."
"He is a police officer."
"Olive oil."
"Until Thursday."
"Firm and dignified."
"We have eye contact."
"I'll never know."
"Thanks for coming back."
"This very night."
"It's going there."
"It shows on you."
"I should have thought about it before."
"Well, look at that."
"Now you are mine."
"They don't have it."
"It's our house."
"They must be careful."
"I used to dream about you."
"I've been working."
"You must see this."
"It's over, my friend."
"All right, young man."
"Blessed be God."
"And good night."
"It's very far."
"Open that door."
"I am very interested."
"It's in fashion."
"Yes, I understood."
"Tell me something good."
"He is on a trip."
"Good morning, Lieutenant."
"Men's things."
"Now I'm going."
"Nobody would say so."
"Where there’s a will, there’s a way."
"Then I'm going with you."
"Since I was born."
"Or snot."
"You should be sleeping."
"Years have passed."
"Let there be ten."
"All right, enough."
"Whoever it is."
"Now we're leaving."
"Beer, please."
"Then that's it."
"Well, if you insist."
"Look at the ball."
"They are very young."
"Let's investigate."
"Look this way."
"Then I'll go with you."
"I can't hear them."
"That's right, sir."
"Very modern art."
"Now come here."
"To my son."
"Finish the job."
"Good morning, darling."
"Listen, please."
"Let him try."
"I already forgot."
"In the warehouse."
"And now go."
"I already fixed it."
"Speaking of Rome."
"The walls have ears."
"Move like them."
"What you hear."
"Here comes another one."
"I found something better."
"And very well."
"Please, thank you."
"I went to the movies."
"Not me, thanks."
"Merry Christmas, my friend."
"We have it all."
"No ordinary girl."
"I'm fine, fine."
"Somewhere else."
"I love you, sweetheart."
"Keep the formation."
"I'll go change."
"He won't do it."
"On the arm."
"That's right, boy."
"Let's go for another one."
"We must be together."
"Give me the book."
"I must be."
"Don't yell at him."
"It's really important."
"It was years ago."
"That big."
"And they were right."
"Because I love her."
"I'll make the call."
"At this moment."
"Sex, sex, sex."
"That was tough."
"Dear, please."
"At any price."
"We have heard stories."
"I always did."
"Faith of the heart."
"Three and a half."
"I'm looking at it."
"It's my chance."
"I found freedom."
"It's the beginning."
"And now you."
"A good girl."
"Nobody is innocent."
"Let me do that."
"I shouldn't do it."
"Shake his hand."
"Shadows and flames."
"Oh, your talent."
"My only son."
"I bet you."
"And I want to do it."
"Keep it all."
"You'll like this."
"Down the hall."
"We have a relationship."
"Now we understand each other."
"It's our song."
"That's power."
"We are live."
"I'll try, sir."
"The greater good."
"I passed the test."
"Oh, thank you, sir."
"Well, sometimes."
"I know many things."
"You have to forgive me."
"When I say so."
"I love you, honey."
"Because I will."
"She looks very pretty."
"I have one here."
"Well, well, sir."
"I'm the coach."
"Ceasefire."
"Of course it comes."
"It's good to see it."
"It's me, Dad."
"I would like to meet you."
"You are my woman."
"I was about to call you."
"I found a new one."
"That's already happened."
"Waiting for the order."
"Get going."
"That can happen."
"Give me a few minutes."
"I'll come back up."
"You have to move."
"There it is all."
"This is him."
"It was about time."
"All right, let's see."
"It is very rare."
"And there it was."
"Let's repeat it."
"No press."
"We should leave now."
"Here I stay."
"Tell him to come up."
"Oh, I would love to."
"To my brother."
"Remove the cover."
"Now we can talk."
"It's a balloon."
"It was a robbery."
"Hello how are you?"
"In a sanatorium."
"A clever boy."
"Hey, be careful."
"Yes, it is extraordinary."
"They will have to wait."
"I just heard it."
"Well, let's get to work."
"I'm going for water."
"You're a coward."
"He's a jerk."
"Yes, Number One."
"You almost made it."
"Goodbye, good night."
"Today is Wednesday."
"He won't go far."
"I'll introduce you to her."
"It's your eyes."
"You'll be fine here."
"I do want to."
"I did that."
"And they will."
"Ah, never mind."
"Fairy tale."
"You're welcome, my friend."
"Enjoy it while you can."
"It is my intention."
"It's four o'clock."
"We took her."
"In the tower."
"Not like others."
"Good luck today."
"Good morning, officer."
"They said many things."
"Without a trace."
"As you hear it."
"You have a house."
"Yes, now yes."
"How it has grown."
"Good luck, boy."
"Think about mom."
"It's a ship."
"I'll tell it."
"All to port."
"I'll treat you."
"He doesn't remember."
"We need him here."
"And the children."
"Maybe it's true."
"I have counted them."
"I'll have the same."
"Lesson number one."
"Listen to me for a moment."
"He made a lot of money."
"Come on, put it on."
"With your father."
"Yes, come here."
"It was so sweet."
"That's sensational."
"Yes, it is different."
"Happy birthday, dear."
"Close the blinds."
"Take a turn."
"She will do it."
"I have an illness."
"For all this."
"I do it well."
"Give me your money."
"Learn from me."
"It was very sweet."
"I have good aim."
"Stretch your arm."
"I'm very curious."
"Now I am free."
"You must move on."
"I understand you now."
"To say the least."
"We will take care of it."
"They are for me."
"I'm talking about now."
"He won't understand."
"You're welcome, ma'am."
"There's just me."
"Give him a cigarette."
"This will be good."
"It's not that one."
"I will, Mom."
"You will like it very much."
"Be careful, my friend."
"We need a miracle."
"Bridge to Engineering."
"At the movies."
"Goodbye, see you tomorrow."
"For victory."
"They look very similar."
"I'm pretty good."
"Go if you want."
"Excuse me a minute."
"All for you."
"I have the letters."
"Ok, here we go."
"For the second time."
"Sorry, professor."
"I know, thanks."
"The human race."
"It's his thing."
"Woman, woman, woman."
"He set us free."
"It's a record."
"See you, old man."
"This is ours."
"I need to drink something."
"We are in Mexico."
"Open this door."
"Give me the hat."
"And we met."
"Go look."
"Go to lunch."
"After you."
"I'll get another job."
"Give me the revolver."
"Give me the watch."
"I love you now."
"Just a few seconds."
"It's a question."
"You're looking at it."
"I'll give them back to you."
"You'll be fine, honey."
"A lovely girl."
"How pretty you are."
"Here you go, dad."
"It won't turn out well."
"Sorry, Coach."
"Merry Christmas, sir."
"This is unfair."
"I've heard something."
"I'm considering it."
"They are carrots."
"It would be good for you."
"Put your feet up."
"I didn't notice it."
"We're going to pass."
"My light shines."
"Let's practice."
"I'm talking about this."
"Tell us where it is."
"It's my story."
"You really are."
"With a man."
"They have the green light."
"They are not drugs."
"I'm coming, Dad."
"One, please."
"Give me that book."
"I have deceived you."
"I'm incognito."
"I'll start over."
"Whatever he says."
"Until the afternoon."
"I think we should."
"I already got it."
"Now I have it."
"How beautiful she is."
"I'll show you how."
"I didn't expect this."
"You're a big mouth."
"There's someone here."
"In the stable."
"I can solve this."
"I am a private investigator."
"It's all planned."
"And the money."
"You must do something."
"Everything is relative."
"You are a psychopath."
"It is completely harmless."
"It may be important."
"Now the other one."
"Here you go, boy."
"I love mom."
"Your last chance."
"It will be a success."
"Enjoy the party."
"In the war."
"But there it is."
"Just as I thought."
"He and I."
"It's all mine."
"In the studio."
"It's all ours."
"Sorry, Grandpa."
"I have the information."
"I would like to try it."
"It's an advantage."
"Four of diamonds."
"To the house."
"You'll like him."
"It's a comment."
"When they are ready."
"I don't hide."
"Baby, please."
"We laughed a lot."
"I feel your presence."
"You will do the following."
"Take off your blouse."
"Open the closet."
"We start again."
"Just a moment, darling."
"But it is different."
"They never do."
"I don't work here."
"All the way."
"It is a palace."
"I'm looking out for you."
"Four, please."
"I like to have fun."
"They will find the ring."
"Give me the stone."
"Worth every penny."
"Much has changed."
"So come."
"Well, it's official."
"It must be fun."
"I already read it."
"It's our home."
"He's my stepfather."
"Number, please."
"In his basement."
"You're laughing."
"Breaking and entering."
"Well, what a marvel."
"To my family."
"I'll bring a doctor."
"I've heard things."
"I'm blank."
"Front view."
"Yes, well, thank you."
"And very good."
"Tell him yes."
"I used to live here."
"You sing very well."
"Wait for my order."
"Mind your manners."
"Let's say hello."
"It feels great."
"The One Ring."
"You're fine now."
"I'm just saying that."
"Just a second, buddy."
"Time to play."
"We were good friends."
"It is the heart."
"This is certain."
"I'll be going now."
"You are very observant."
"Work with us."
"Well, now yes."
"It explains everything."
"Here's daddy."
"It's a paradise."
"You are my girlfriend."
"Just tell me when."
"Let's go right now."
"Get on the plane."
"You're watching it."
"Please sit down, sir."
"Sometimes not."
"It's a sneak peek."
"It's the rain."
"That will be easy."
"I can't dance."
"He's my grandfather."
"Free my mind."
"Put it back on."
"Put it on again."
"But it's here."
"A lovely woman."
"Friends forever."
"In the cafeteria."
"Nine and a half."
"Yes, they were."
"You'll see them again."
"Don't be a child."
"I didn't read it."
"For his father."
"I already found it."
"It's up here."
"It's New Year's."
"On television."
"Don't drink anymore."
"Mom, don't start."
"Brothers and sisters."
"That was brilliant."
"Come, look at this."
"I am a winner."
"Please, boss."
"That sounds better."
"Separate your legs."
"Go away, go away, go away."
"Don't get married."
"Take care of business."
"They are a team."
"You don't know how."
"Back to work."
"Please, mother."
"Now it makes sense."
"The first kiss."
"I am a stone."
"Well, you're welcome."
"We're going after them."
"Give me your coins."
"Fix things up."
"I have learned a lot."
"Not with anyone."
"It's his style."
"Very well thought out."
"Yes, look at this."
"He is a charlatan."
"You've been dreaming."
"In one gulp."
"This one's yours."
"Forgive my life."
"There will be big surprises."
"Glory, glory, hallelujah."
"Don't try anything."
"Use your words."
"Oh, how beautiful."
"It's worth a lot of money."
"But it's fun."
"Just like dad."
"Give him a drink."
"My apologies, sir."
"Nobody wants to talk."
"It was my father."
"Let me start earlier."
"There is plenty of time."
"Eleven thirty."
"I feel them now."
"I have to talk."
"This will be great."
"Well, it's the same."
"I'm saying it."
"I have to feel it."
"I want to be perfect."
"Give it another chance."
"All winter."
"This is temporary."
"Please be attentive."
"I want to do it."
"Let's sing."
"It says so here."
"Four and a half."
"Enough with politics."
"In my heart."
"You have a letter."
"It is your witness."
"I took an oath."
"How you have grown."
"For women."
"You know what it's like."
"Wait until you see it."
"You have to get it out."
"I've gotten over it."
"From her husband."
"Look at that thing."
"See you tomorrow, then."
"I'll ask around."
"Out of the car."
"That's what we all say."
"We can still win."
"I never did that."
"I'll go take a shower."
"We arrived home."
"They're all yours."
"I have a camera."
"To the girl."
"Then me too."
"That will never change."
"So goodbye."
"He's on it."
"Now you are free."
"He is the captain."
"I dropped out of school."
"It's the key."
"I always do that."
"I don't believe her."
"I've been sick."
"I like that one."
"Yes, I must go."
"I do not exist."
"Tomorrow is fine."
"There is a God."
"I have a test."
"Like the dinosaur."
"It's my field."
"What a cute little dog."
"For God's sake, yes."
"I have a lot."
"It could be interesting."
"Police station."
"I want some answers."
"In the butt."
"We are a democracy."
"We must be close."
"You could put it like that."
"There is plenty of space."
"I need an explanation."
"You are him."
"Well, it seems so."
"What a beautiful day."
"Nobody will see it."
"Something is changing."
"But there's more."
"Ready to go."
"Yes, to everyone."
"Show me the money."
"All right, take it."
"The Night Rider."
"And I love her."
"Better yes."
"They have been here."
"From the police."
"Let's get closer."
"I'll make the arrangements."
"It's eight o'clock."
"Hey, hey, hey."
"Amen to that."
"Captain, please."
"Say please."
"It is very quiet."
"Let's cross."
"Until Tuesday."
"Two of swords."
"Very well, my lord."
"I'm absolutely sure."
"They are my people."
"Please, old man."
"I have accepted it."
"We are checking it."
"Just a moment, ma'am."
"Just for fun."
"How brave you are."
"Me too, friend."
"Okay, ma'am."
"Good morning, mother."
"We got married yesterday."
"Innocent, Your Honor."
"I never see you."
"I have to keep going."
"Rule number two."
"It's my wedding."
"We're coming for you."
"I'm coming, boss."
"How kind he is."
"In the window."
"I never forgot it."
"I'm your partner."
"Not even by chance."
"We have to talk about it."
"It's history now."
"I'm not him."
"Only the best."
"Now we have it."
"I'll be honest with you."
"Still standing."
"But he can't."
"With one exception."
"Give me your plate."
"Come, I'll teach you."
"You ruined everything."
"It's a novelty."
"You're a cutie."
"To buy things."
"It is trustworthy."
"Yes, you were."
"Good morning, daddy."
"See you later, crocodile."
"This is politics."
"Give me my keys."
"And we are out."
"I'll catch up with them later."
"I don't love him."
"Give it a chance."
"It's something like this."
"It must be close."
"Don't leave her."
"They never found her."
"Maybe this is it."
"I see them now."
"We can work together."
"Give me the photo."
"Start again."
"Give them a chance."
"I offer myself."
"I don't ask questions."
"They used to be elves."
"There's more."
"What has he done?"
"And to him."
"I love to read."
"We'll sort ourselves out."
"I have given it to him."
"Well, again."
"I have a photo."
"There is another type."
"Yes, that's what I did."
"Good afternoon, guys."
"Come visit us."
"It's a labyrinth."
"Make your magic."
"I admire its purity."
"To each his own."
"Come closer to me."
"As if it mattered."
"On your part."
"No one can pass."
"He's looking for something."
"I would have liked it."
"There it is, sir."
"Tax free."
"In the freezer."
"With my husband."
"And look now."
"It's okay, daddy."
"I'll go after him."
"Professor, please."
"Oh my God, Mom."
"This is enough."
"I loved seeing you."
"I would love to do it."
"I have foreseen it."
"Bring a towel."
"I know many."
"And look at you now."
"Well, I see."
"In a bank."
"Lower the hose."
"Well, I got it."
"Good job, son."
"It was something incredible."
"Last night I dreamed about you."
"Good evening, madame."
"Remember your training."
"Call the mayor."
"It's an eagle."
"I look forward to your call."
"There is a note."
"And to her."
"Just a name."
"Enough of that."
"Leave the dog."
"It's been lovely."
"I'm speechless."
"Live and learn."
"It was my salvation."
"Look how pretty."
"Please drink."
"Like me."
"Children's things."
"That's extraordinary."
"And yours."
"Like the movie."
"He is listening to us."
"This will never work."
"Oh, let me see."
"You're as good as new."
"Better than yesterday."
"A big surprise."
"You are a vision."
"I'll have to do it."
"This is brilliant."
"Hold on a second."
"It is my wish."
"Not very fast."
"It's absolutely amazing."
"Me, no one else."
"You're pretty good."
"I need a receipt."
"But that's how it was."
"Maybe something else."
"Right this way."
"We are still men."
"Very well, father."
"Camel hair."
"We are very proud."
"One of two."
"I know what they look like."
"You're going with me."
"The safe."
"Ok, very good."
"It's okay, honey."
"An incredible woman."
"I'll be fine, Mom."
"We have to bury him."
"A transport, I hope."
"Yes, yes, good."
"This is surprising."
"He's really smart."
"I understood the message."
"It's our time."
"It's the protocol."
"But you're here."
"I have a clue."
"All right, baby."
"All yours, friend."
"It's a feeling."
"Calm down, calm down, calm down."
"It's a wonderful thing."
"Who says so?"
"There you go, friend."
"You need another way out."
"Search again."
"Just a drink."
"Just one drink."
"I'm her friend."
"A good question."
"You have to live."
"I'm not lucky."
"You are a romantic."
"Nobody would do it."
"It's made of plastic."
"Please, step back."
"Mommy is here."
"Well, see you soon."
"Yes, my sergeant."
"One o'clock."
"I hope I helped."
"I'm not her."
"I am Lt."
"Thirty-four."
"She was very sweet."
"You are a marvel."
"Enough with the words."
"Yes it does happen."
"I'm her boyfriend."
"You are very generous."
"It's his specialty."
"Give me the stick."
"Yes, that's how it will be."
"Just one month."
"Yes, yes we can."
"He is very quiet."
"It has a name."
"You are my bodyguard."
"Now the leg."
"I can't, Dad."
"You knew it was coming."
"Someone is looking for you."
"We'll do it tomorrow."
"Rome has changed."
"I have to get ready."
"Sure, I'd love to."
"Don't think so much."
"It is everything."
"He believed it."
"The captain speaks."
"But we do."
"I was waiting for your call."
"Much the same."
"Full of life."
"Good luck, dear."
"Eight of swords."
"To look for a job."
"This is you."
"Take it and go."
"Let's catch him."
"There is another sign."
"The clever guy."
"Thanks for bringing us."
"Boys and girls."
"We'll find out."
"I've already been."
"They have it all."
"Arc light."
"A wonderful woman."
"Apart from that."
"Kisses and hugs."
"That's deep."
"Well, maybe so."
"Put me through to him."
"But I'll try."
"Time to act."
"They are my things."
"Look how he dresses."
"We'll see soon."
"Prima facie."
"He never does."
"Nothing for you."
"I hope so, sir."
"Good night, brother."
"From my sister."
"I remembered now."
"He knows my name."
"We're done for today."
"We'll do it now."
"It's a dinosaur."
"Ok, I'll do it."
"Therefore."
"A human sacrifice."
"And my father."
"It is very stimulating."
"You can stay with me."
"I was always here."
"He was an artist."
"You never mentioned it."
"It is a privilege."
"Yes, on Monday."
"It's your turn to share."
"How sorry I am."
"It's an amulet."
"We have to see it."
"It's a suggestion."
"I am an android."
"Hit the gas."
"It's bigger."
"I think so, ma'am."
"I remember it clearly."
"They have left."
"I am very intelligent."
"Yes, she speaks."
"And he leaves."
"It depends on the dream."
"It's our head."
"I know a little."
"I'm going to tell."
"They were my horses."
"You are my lawyer."
"You know her."
"I know it perfectly well."
"What a wonderful choice."
"Tell me the number."
"You said you would call."
"Good luck, cowboy."
"The same eyes."
"Yes, I had it."
"Here's to you."
"Whenever I can."
"More, more, more."
"Men and women."
"I am Hector."
"Teammate."
"Now we are free."
"I brought you one."
"She's a sweetheart."
"You made that up."
"Enough for me."
"Please fill me in."
"It's your phone."
"Take care of mom."
"My older brother."
"I'll open it now."
"I understand you, friend."
"It's so soft."
"Now I am."
"Check the log."
"Oh, good morning."
"I'm visiting."
"It was so much fun."
"Yes, yes I know."
"Have a good trip, darling."
"I hope soon."
"Open your spirit."
"Go while you can."
"Now I have you."
"I'm feeling it."
"Yes, someday."
"I'll have to wait."
"This is special."
"We will do the following."
"I like to travel."
"He's my grandson."
"Then it's over."
"Relax and breathe."
"I have to find out."
"A space monkey."
"God, you are beautiful."
"He was a Yankee."
"It's the latest."
"With his father."
"It tastes very good."
"Oh, hello, honey."
"Ring spectra."
"Many of them."
"I'll continue."
"It's simply amazing."
"Just let me go."
"He is very tall."
"You look like a lizard."
"I'll pick up my things."
"Let's see them."
"In good time."
"I believe that."
"That sounds about right."
"We'll have to do it."
"Nobody forces you."
"It's a puzzle."
"It brings good luck."
"It's your anniversary."
"With the police."
"All the children."
"He's a scammer."
"Whiskey on the rocks."
"The police arrived."
"Let's fix it."
"How beautiful it is."
"Now it's ours."
"Man to man."
"I'm going to answer."
"I am her."
"But you know what?"
"Doing it is believing it."
"You guys are amazing."
"And the wine."
"Let's take a shower."
"To your post."
"Not by phone."
"You are so big."
"I'm just playing."
"And he was."
"You have to fix it."
"I like them all."
"Give it to her."
"Please, listen."
"I'll never understand."
"It's okay, grandpa."
"Months have passed."
"You must not speak."
"You did it, my friend."
"Well, yes, yes."
"I know how it sounds."
"They are on it."
"You know it does."
"About this size."
"They're just things."
"You've grown a lot."
"Remember one thing."
"It has grown a lot."
"I'm a boy."
"It's always there."
"I want to discuss this."
"Paint my portrait."
"Of course I have."
"There was a car."
"Mine don't."
"Turning around."
"Just a guy."
"Or you make soap."
"They are following them."
"We almost made it."
"A military experiment."
"I came for him."
"And then go."
"I want whiskey."
"They already have it."
"It's quite strong."
"I'll pass it on to you."
"Permission to speak."
"Yes, you were right."
"Give me a demonstration."
"Now you are here."
"Son, come with me."
"Another time."
"Good afternoon, Captain."
"See you later, dear."
"It's the family."
"I have to leave it."
"Give me the child."
"Lower your heads."
"Go and tell him."
"You would have been strong."
"A nobody."
"Eight thirty."
"There is another person."
"Enough, both of you."
"I'm going to cut."
"Don't try to talk."
"They have already arrived."
"Here you have them."
"Give me the surprise."
"You will marry me."
"I care a lot."
"He loves to play."
"You don't love him."
"Bring a doctor."
"It is absolutely true."
"Tell him why."
"Good morning, beautiful."
"Oh, sure, sure."
"Yes, sir, yes."
"Come, sit here."
"She is outside."
"More good news."
"Mind your words."
"Here I have them."
"For you, little one."
"Enjoy your dinner."
"It must be taken out."
"I just need one."
"I was very proud."
"I have a splinter."
"What a nice name."
"What times those were."
"Give me the order."
"Don't call her."
"Tell him to come back."
"I don't notice anything."
"I'm working now."
"And now I'm leaving."
"It's in position."
"They are still here."
"What shall we do now?"
"This proves it."
"Let me ask you this."
"My God, look at you."
"You have your qualities."
"And the pyramids."
"Why are you doing this?"
"Look at the photo."
"Hanging out."
"Yes, speaking."
"Nobody wants her."
"It's a camp."
"It is quite common."
"It's my secret."
"Make a house."
"At eleven."
"Testing, one, two."
"If it does."
"Here's more."
"I know what you're like."
"It's almost full."
"It's the business."
"Because I'm married."
"On to something else."
"Please leave it."
"You already know them."
"Glory to the Lord."
"But it does."
"Come with me now."
"This is Italy."
"This and that."
"Yes, we are men."
"I'll turn around."
"Don't believe them."
"Ham and cheese."
"They have stopped."
"I take responsibility."
"For your future."
"Check out this site."
"Look how good."
"Yes, that would be fun."
"You must be patient."
"Compliance and Responsibility."
"I have to fly."
"And he did it."
"The last letter."
"Two thirty."
"I look up."
"This is her."
"Come, it's important."
"Someone sent them."
"They will have to do it."
"Please hug me."
"I'll fix everything."
"You'll have to find out."
"I'm real."
"Live life."
"One of the big ones."
"Change of course."
"I have a case."
"In my wallet."
"The world changes."
"It's from here."
"Hi buddy."
"Please, friends."
"I'll find a way."
"But you do it."
"There was a lot of traffic."
"I allow it."
"I have to go through."
"Give me the details."
"They don't leave."
"It's a fortune."
"It has been impressive."
"Start over."
"Yes, it is nice."
"Let's go to the bathroom."
"The truth is, me."
"I would love to meet her."
"No one can leave."
"Come here now."
"You accept your fate."
"With my sister."
"It is a temple."
"What great news."
"I'm sorry, forgive me."
"I always am."
"I'm running late."
"Give me your lighter."
"Not even a second."
"That way."
"You have the money."
"For next time."
"Birthdate."
"And so it was."
"One of the greats."
"It came true."
"I'm fine, buddy."
"I'm Sgt."
"Go on vacation."
"Correction, please."
"Daddy, please."
"Enough for now."
"There goes another one."
"Wait, there's more."
"It's our policy."
"It's the hair."
"Brothers in arms."
"People will talk."
"I'm just thinking."
"Today and tomorrow."
"I'll change it for you."
"That would be all."
"Good work today."
"Find out where it is."
"I've already taken care of it."
"Yes, they are great."
"A simple question."
"I want to apologize to you."
"Take off his clothes."
"Handle carefully."
"Hello and goodbye."
"You don't need to do it."
"Not even him."
"Pick up the pace."
"What I needed."
"Yes, yes, let's go."
"They look good on you."
"Make your move."
"Let it finish."
"What things you say."
"Tell her."
"I'll bring you water."
"Not now, Mom."
"In the laboratory."
"Yes, I met him."
"No doctors."
"You can come in now."
"No beating around the bush."
"Old, very old."
"I have a permit."
"It's your dream."
"Well, here I go."
"Seven and eight."
"With your brother."
"Yes, it is likely."
"I have them on top of me."
"Keep doing this."
"It seems very nice."
"What you heard."
"Prepare the tea."
"You'll have to jump."
"For coffee."
"I oppose."
"But this is true."
"Hey, white boy."
"All right, go."
"Because it's brilliant."
"One more photo."
"You may have a seat."
"The Air Force."
"Passports, please."
"I shouldn't drink."
"AFAIK."
"All right, Sergeant."
"It's quite important."
"Give up."
"It has been interesting."
"What a nice house."
"The wind blows."
"Look at this, man."
"Give me an answer."
"I've arrived."
"And here too."
"Wait a minute, folks."
"Good morning, students."
"Okay, here."
"Don't be a chicken."
"I'm waiting for it."
"Let's go with them."
"For your health."
"Thanks for stopping."
"We'll have a party."
"I'm from the future."
"Think like that."
"Just his reputation."
"Thank you, old friend."
"It's the host."
"Yes, you like it."
"That's it, good."
"Trust her."
"Let's see yours."
"And the phone."
"I'm so glad."
"Come in and see."
"You do the right thing."
"It was very close."
"I would change the day."
"I ask for the floor."
"I was walking around here."
"That was interesting."
"Forcibly."
"I am his niece."
"I am the godfather."
"You are so lovely."
"That would be amazing."
"He wants you to go."
"You're right, yes."
"Very well, I'll go."
"Give me the spear."
"What do you mean no?"
"Count the money."
"You will always be mine."
"I wasn't expecting any visitors."
"No trespassing."
"The one that follows."
"Now you're mine."
"I think I should."
"That helps a lot."
"Yes, here you go."
"What a nice tie."
"It was an impulse."
"A black cook."
"I can accept that."
"You are with us."
"Like heroin."
"Yes, it would be."
"Six, seven, eight."
"He is my brother-in-law."
"Move, move, move."
"I don't know, babe."
"He liked me."
"Is anyone here?"
"We have to protect ourselves."
"The whole movie."
"This is lovely."
"That never happened."
"I am a fan."
"I am enlightened."
"One step forward."
"Take the cane."
"Let's talk privately."
"This is heavy."
"I like to play."
"He is not sure."
"I'll make an exception."
"Do one thing."
"That costs money."
"Good, all good."
"He is her husband."
"It is the light."
"A real gentleman."
"There is one more."
"Get on the horse."
"I never answer."
"Yes, it's them."
"I'll remind him."
"Ah, yes, that."
"You're right, my friend."
"About ten years."
"Yes, I can feel it."
"But you must go."
"I'm still young."
"Now I like it."
"You can imagine."
"A white boy."
"It works like a charm."
"Towards the future."
"He has been sick."
"Put on your suit."
"I am your representative."
"You always are."
"And your money."
"Wood Elves."
"This is terrifying."
"Command post."
"For friends."
"I would love to see you."
"Make it happen."
"We can be together."
"You're scaring her."
"I support the motion."
"Let's check."
"He's too smart."
"I go in and out."
"I'll grab it."
"It's too late now."
"Target shooting."
"What a nice outfit."
"Combat posts."
"You are a 'tourist'."
"We have all changed."
"This is Sicily."
"I read about that."
"You said yes."
"Take the direction."
"My twin sister."
"You are done."
"Okay, we're off."
"I know the owner."
"Return home."
"It can happen now."
"In your opinion."
"You have my phone number."
"It's five o'clock."
"You have a good eye."
"That's great, darling."
"Five days ago."
"I was about to."
"The real truth."
"You noticed."
"We can go now."
"It feels wonderful."
"You will survive."
"I won't tell."
"It's the drugs."
"It's a second."
"Go after him."
"Take care of your back."
"Tomorrow is Saturday."
"She's my granddaughter."
"License and registration."
"Oh, the children."
"Come for breakfast."
"I'm with them."
"I'm already up."
"Now you try it."
"Lower the screen."
"But you promised."
"Hi how are things."
"Sixty-five."
"I love to talk."
"If one wants."
"For my own good."
"I'm checking it out."
"It goes on and on."
"But we are friends."
"To the corner."
"Put on your life jackets."
"Everyone but you."
"Very good, good."
"Seventy-nine."
"Coffee for me."
"He was very strong."
"The condom, of course."
"Give me the cigarettes."
"Rest for a moment."
"God, God, God."
"The system works."
"It was our creation."
"It's for Brick."
"Oh, of course."
"She looks delicious."
"We are on the move."
"Use your instincts."
"What a good memory."
"Bring a stretcher."
"Get on the boat."
"Enough with the ceremonies."
"Because of him."
"Ready to start."
"God, I hope so."
"Ninety-six."
"Boys or girls."
"Be careful, son."
"Very good audience."
"It's back there."
"The Holy Grail."
"In my laboratory."
"Pretty good, thanks."
"Fortune and glory."
"It's Russian."
"I see the bet."
"Look at that girl."
"Let's go find them."
"A clever guy."
"You move fast."
"That is justice."
"Good morning, senators."
"It won't be."
"It's close too."
"Colonel, please."
"You weren't here."
"Body of Christ."
"You have made the right decision."
"Make the deal."
"Go in and out."
"We have a son."
"You have beautiful skin."
"The complete operation."
"Very well trained."
"Nice and easy."
"But I need answers."
"He wants a divorce."
"Security phones."
"I'll give you money."
"That was then."
"Two months left."
"I'll go, sir."
"Order, please."
"I've felt it."
"How long without seeing you."
"We're going to arrive."
"Let's do a test."
"Give me the dice."
"You'll have it, for sure."
"I'm going to pay."
"It must be wonderful."
"Buy a caravan."
"Nobody believes him."
"To my husband."
"I understand, it's important."
"You are very fast."
"It must be stopped."
"They grow so fast."
"I know, sweetheart."
"It was always you."
"What I do."
"Maybe it was them."
"There will be another time."
"That's today."
"We received a signal."
"It's your hair salon."
"You can open it now."
"To enter the war."
"I remember meeting him."
"You came for me."
"You're going too fast."
"In my life."
"They want the house."
"Just a game."
"Want to buy one."
"Rise and shine."
"Whenever you say."
"To yours."
"You're not coming back here."
"We have a responsibility."
"I will go to space."
"He's had enough."
"I am Jerusalem."
"Ten to minus."
"It's my pleasure."
"Only I will remain."
"It's a life."
"Call me sometime."
"That's right, baby."
"It was an experiment."
"They start listening to it."
"I need the job."
"It was a job."
"I didn't touch you."
"Find a partner."
"I'll see you downstairs."
"Dad did it."
"They are always playing."
"We will take care of the house."
"What a perfect day."
"Like a horse."
"Almost eight hours."
"It's a microphone."
"Yes, many things."
"I saw him touch you."
"Sorry, sweetheart."
"I have a collection."
"Okay, let's get to work."
"I'll send someone."
"Oh, I got it."
"Whichever you want."
"We'll start with this."
"Night after night."
"Two to one."
"Worm sign."
"In other words."
"That will teach them."
"That's tomorrow."
"There will be a lot of people."
"I wanted to be a dentist."
"A first-class one."
"It looks very similar."
"We wanted one."
"They are fools."
"I only have friends."
"I'm the manager."
"Good, good, thank you."
"Be a good girl."
"Yes, you can do it."
"In a nutshell."
"We have a barrel."
"Good night, boy."
"I am a grave."
"I have the disc."
"We have seen it."
"I try to guide."
"Peace and love."
"Let's go back to camp."
"Walking the dog."
"With your mother."
"This is going well."
"Not just you."
"As if I could."
"Now I'm sure."
"It doesn't suit you."
"It could be, yes."
"Go after her."
"Then I met you."
"I want a boy."
"Yes, something similar."
"It has its charm."
"We'll tell him."
"Meat pie."
"Very nice, man."
"Now we are equal."
"Give me that doll."
"Still no answer."
"Two large cans."
"Three more months."
"You sent others."
"Hold on to something."
"Do good."
"It will be very easy."
"Come with me, sir."
"You tell me what."
"There are very few."
"You called for fun."
"With both of them."
"Take a break."
"Yes, I love him."
"They've been around for a thousand years."
"This here."
"She won't be back."
"See you later, sir."
"If there is time."
"Now they are mine."
"We will keep in touch."
"It's that guy."
"I negotiate this."
"Grab a partner."
"That's the only thing."
"I can go with you."
"It's true, yes."
"Seven thirty."
"He was doing well."
"What a nice photo."
"You must be sure."
"And good work."
"I'm inviting you."
"That possibility exists."
"On the shoulders."
"He just ate."
"It looks pretty big."
"It's my people."
"It's our life."
"I'll do my best."
"A lovely guy."
"He's coming towards me."
"I will open the window."
"To the library."
"It's your gift."
"It sounds good."
"From around here."
"I know this music."
"It's my operation."
"There you have them."
"I'm in shape."
"We had it all."
"Seriously speaking."
"You're playing with me."
"Yes, he was here."
"Take off your tie."
"It has to exist."
"Winning is winning."
"A whole day."
"I have many names."
"Ten days ago."
"Greetings to all."
"Change your clothes."
"Grab her legs."
"I am an officer."
"You look the same."
"They have succeeded."
"There are always two."
"You should be resting."
"We'll be fine here."
"Let's hide it."
"Yes, he loves it."
"Oh, how kind."
"We have to go out."
"Yes, you'll see."
"It's so peaceful."
"Then everything changed."
"In the tavern."
"I'm back to work."
"Good luck, friends."
"It's something incredible."
"I like doing it."
"I have to take a risk."
"They're out there."
"Captain to the bridge."
"Those were good times."
"I can't drink."
"No phones."
"I'm in here."
"I know how you think."
"Good evening, officers."
"The trees speak."
"I have another car."
"Yes, it's hot."
"Drop the phone."
"Something is planned."
"Where is it now?"
"It's a piece of advice."
"Place your bets, gentlemen."
"Quite clearly."
"Yes, quite well."
"Now seriously."
"And the head."
"If you want it."
"I hope you are doing well."
"Because we are brothers."
"And he does."
"I love you, boy."
"Look at these things."
"Let's tell him."
"It's our tradition."
"We can do it now."
"Say the words."
"I repeat it to you."
"It has never happened."
"I raise the bet."
"He went to the bathroom."
"Not for sure."
"You are so sensitive."
"I won't leave them."
"You have that look."
"Look, it's important."
"In many countries."
"She's my girl."
"From my dreams."
"Nobody at all."
"Yes, love."
"No one will find you."
"I'm with friends."
"I have a dollar."
"I accept the correction."
"End of the road."
"There are always options."
"Come here, little friend."
"I'm about to."
"With the hips."
"Well, I like it."
"I won't leave her."
"From the office."
"That sounds like fun."
"Only in part."
"Voicemail."
"Yes, like you."
"Everything is going great."
"It should be me."
"I know he'll come."
"I already did that."
"But you have money."
"Please try it."
"It's my cell phone."
"You look sensational."
"I was the last one."
"You will find your courage."
"I'll be fine here."
"Give me one here."
"All for nothing."
"Ah, I get it now."
"We are the good ones."
"Oh, good night."
"You are better."
"That's right, dear."
"We can handle them."
"That one is soft."
"I just need to rest."
"And beyond."
"Everything will be resolved."
"It'll be okay, guys."
"You look like a princess."
"Oh, good heavens."
"Let's go to the basement."
"Single row."
"Yes, yes it is."
"There is a child."
"Nobody knows that."
"Passing time."
"And I you."
"Look at the moon."
"I had a brother."
"The bus arrived."
"They are very fast."
"She is a nun."
"I'm fine, calm."
"I wasn't ready."
"Give me a bullet."
"It has been perfect."
"You have to feel it."
"I wish I hadn't."
"You know my file."
"I take charge."
"And I need answers."
"All hands on deck."
"I'm leaving early."
"It's going to dawn."
"I'm still working."
"I'm going to swim."
"In the infirmary."
"A complete success."
"Some of that."
"Okay, look at this."
"Yes, we'll be fine."
"Three of them."
"I'll make dinner."
"A pleasure, madam."
"But they can't."
"Cancel the order."
"Only sometimes."
"He had been shot."
"Merry Christmas, darling."
"Then, to the doctor."
"Then don't go."
"I bought the airline."
"For your collection."
"I've figured it out."
"Good morning, sister."
"In every sense."
"You're welcome, miss."
"It's noisy."
"Because of drugs."
"It has to happen."
"These are yours."
"I have a sister."
"I love you, cousin."
"That's what we're getting at."
"It was his destiny."
"We all knew it."
"Clear the door."
"We prefer not to."
"I'm going to get it."
"Typical of him."
"Oh, I hope so."
"It's a spectacle."
"To be a pilot."
"To your room."
"This was different."
"It is our custom."
"But it's clean."
"Not today, darling."
"Sounds very interesting."
"With one hand."
"That's right, let's go."
"It was very hot."
"You are the chosen one."
"But we made it."
"Ah, yes, sir."
"It's in England."
"I need it tomorrow."
"There are a lot."
"We will tell him."
"He will bring balance."
"But look at that."
"They are very intelligent."
"It's the Russians."
"I'm very sick."
"The stairs change."
"It looks the same."
"Relax and have fun."
"A human woman."
"There has to be."
"It is very reasonable."
"You'll be fine, buddy."
"You already saw it."
"You've already seen it."
"Yes, how good."
"I'll catch up with you now."
"Bring everyone together."
"You come in and out."
"It can support you."
"Lucky day."
"Cut off the electricity."
"Hang out."
"This is water."
"Get a job."
"I'll count to five."
"You know who it is."
"All right, cowboy."
"I have to drive."
"We'll have to think about it."
"We will always be friends."
"You're right, Dad."
"I knew I would come back."
"Well, thank you, sir."
"But they don't."
"I'm doing homework."
"Something like this."
"Let's not do this."
"No fighting."
"Thanks, that's fine."
"Yes, that happens."
"Goodbye, see you later."
"No talking."
"We'll go to dinner."
"I'll shut up now."
"Please, Father."
"Good work, people."
"A strong chancellor."
"I have two jobs."
"Cover the exits."
"It's our future."
"I'm fine, I think."
"Core overload."
"You have to dance."
"You always did."
"Like the wind."
"A big star."
"My, my mouth."
"Bring me the chalk."
"Well, we're here."
"This one is fine."
"I had to leave him."
"It's an egg."
"Wow, that's beautiful."
"You have your moments."
"That gives hope."
"This is now."
"Department of Justice."
"Good night, daughter."
"She wasn't sick."
"By my side."
"One of our own."
"Good night, Grandma."
"Open your mind."
"It will be very simple."
"And his wife."
"In the oven."
"Everything seems fine."
"Do it for mom."
"We are all together."
"That's true, ma'am."
"We must thank him."
"Us against them."
"He is my guest."
"They have to admit it."
"A precious stone."
"I must go there."
"I'd like to hear it."
"This will be enough."
"A great pleasure."
"It's my apartment."
"So, me neither."
"Empty your mind."
"I'm out."
"Left side clear."
"It's my evidence."
"We are very excited."
"This will take time."
"That's right, captain."
"I'll walk you outside."
"Yes, I'm lucky."
"So call me."
"By the legs."
"It's a reflection."
"She's pretty, dude."
"Hey, come back here."
"Hugs and kisses."
"I have the order."
"We're going to the airport."
"It is a key."
"Little by little."
"In this place."
"Look, here it is."
"I accept your bet."
"Allow me a moment."
"I see the moon."
"I need one more."
"It was a good deal."
"But I'll be fine."
"She can work."
"Things of destiny."
"You've been there."
"Let him stay."
"I have plenty."
"Now it's clear."
"I have many questions."
"On Bridge."
"I know, boss."
"It's the lights."
"I'll see you inside."
"I need your statement."
"You have many friends."
"He was talking about me."
"He's a colleague."
"Celebrate Christmas."
"I need fresh eyes."
"He has a Russian accent."
"We have to fix it."
"I have something special."
"Six thirty."
"I have a little."
"Let's get you cleaned up."
"Wash your face."
"I love the gypsy."
"We are in orbit."
"Now we must go."
"I have met her."
"Change of fighter."
"Like a log."
"If you'll excuse us."
"We've talked about it."
"He's been busy."
"It is very practical."
"I had two responsibilities."
"Goat to Figure."
"All the time."
"This is art."
"I want to do that."
"I've already found you out."
"From yours."
"Let them follow them."
"A safe journey."
"You're not looking."
"To the United States."
"They are very clever."
"That's exciting."
"This is not over."
"I really do."
"Good luck, babe."
"Southward."
"You are right, madam."
"It's the baby."
"It's good exercise."
"You're right, dear."
"It's a sure thing."
"We will do it like this."
"Call the sheriff."
"I knew they would come."
"I had to make sure."
"I already know you."
"Yes, we met."
"It should be there."
"It's always me."
"They are out there."
"I need it here."
"I guess I could."
"We are in Italy."
"It could be her."
"I have a match."
"I made a change."
"Thank you, Supreme Chancellor."
"I don't know how to sing."
"Mine does."
"It's something unique."
"It's in French."
"Yes, of course, yes."
"I came to work."
"I'm using it."
"Travel without moving."
"Feels better."
"Yes, I gave it to him."
"Let him come here."
"You know it, right?"
"What a beautiful image."
"He is fine."
"Five and a half."
"And something better."
"And it's good."
"And murders."
"Children, please."
"Squeeze my hand."
"With the lady."
"It's not that either."
"You are very understanding."
"You'll be fine soon."
"There is plenty."
"Hey, listen to this."
"Ask around."
"Hurry up, let's go."
"Thank you, good morning."
"I see many things."
"Go say hello."
"How dare he."
"We'll do it right."
"But it was."
"In that direction."
"Thank you for cooperating."
"In the pantry."
"Look at the water."
"I'm going to call them."
"They are your family."
"We have tried."
"Take that medicine."
"I'll call again."
"Good luck, captain."
"Take your ticket."
"Let's give it to him."
"Well, you're in luck."
"Westward."
"The necessary time."
"Don't allow it."
"You're all wet."
"Grab your jacket."
"That's one."
"Welcome, Your Highness."
"I am a friend of his."
"God, please."
"I'm going all out."
"Give me the torch."
"Dad is sleeping."
"There's mom."
"I am your doctor."
"Yes, I like you."
"I can still hear them."
"Better than anybody."
"It's his handwriting."
"I'll go out for a while."
"That comes later."
"Look for the curtains."
"I went to the archive."
"Yes, that helps."
"Thank you, my lady."
"I need a delivery."
"Take it all out."
"Yes, I got you."
"I need a cocktail."
"Give him your card."
"It will never end like this."
"Wait a minute, cowboy."
"It's where I live."
"These guys don't."
"You know where."
"It's your home."
"Mom, that's enough."
"You have plenty of time."
"Ok, see you."
"Outside, please."
"They'll never know."
"He has a good heart."
"Don't be unfair."
"He has found it."
"Well, yes, of course."
"Sometimes two."
"And here it comes."
"My dear girl."
"I am very observant."
"Give me that tape."
"I have sold it."
"I have everything ready."
"Come you too."
"I want you to pay."
"Oh, I remember."
"Take my coat."
"Move out of the way."
"I'll do better."
"It's our place."
"I would love to, thank you."
"Tell us why."
"I'll bring it now."
"It's the office."
"Of course we should."
"Predict behavior."
"That will be good."
"I don't admit anything."
"I need your address."
"I work with children."
"Yes, I'll call you."
"All right, brother."
"You slept with her."
"I have too."
"Long live you."
"It's his coat."
"He is the manager."
"I'll start recording."
"Now I am happy."
"Yes, we need it."
"Sorry, Homer."
"It's three o'clock."
"The family business."
"It's the spice."
"But you're married."
"It was very funny."
"He's going to throw."
"You should have shot them."
"It's exactly like that."
"He is a bum."
"Just for us."
"In self-defense."
"It's the least."
"Let go of the rope."
"And the intruders."
"Approach the tram."
"Dad would be proud."
"I am a plastic surgeon."
"It was so close."
"Finish the book."
"Nobody will believe you."
"The rest of you, follow me."
"Good job, daddy."
"Here you go, son."
"Get this over with."
"Watch the doors."
"For God's sake, Mom."
"We work well together."
"It's very technical."
"In and out."
"Arrival of travelers."
"It's played like this."
"It's ten dollars."
"I want it here."
"I like to look."
"I saw you come in."
"And wives too."
"The systems work."
"I've been searching."
"He's still out there."
"Give him the keys."
"I still love her."
"Officer, please."
"Mine too."
"I know that hand."
"And a gift."
"Well here we are."
"Good morning, young people."
"I'll fix myself."
"You are a hunter."
"We'll work on that."
"Thank you very much, guys."
"We'll see how."
"I need your love."
"Cheer up."
"The whole package."
"We could have fun."
"So, long."
"Oh yeah, definitely."
"I have worked hard."
"Now I'm ready."
"We are a band."
"Well, it will be fine."
"Black, please."
"Get in, it's open."
"In many places."
"Mom is waiting."
"Goodbye, my friends."
"You are his son."
"Your earnings, sir."
"Now I want to see you."
"I can do it alone."
"Don't judge him."
"You are so innocent."
"I have a speech."
"They wouldn't."
"Three of swords."
"That will teach him."
"Good evening, Senator."
"I have the proof."
"To the police station."
"Please, hurry."
"Now he is not here."
"Good luck, brother."
"Come back another day."
"Brother, please."
"It will take me time."
"Against you, sir."
"On the computer."
"He is the ambassador."
"For dodging bullets."
"I'm very sure."
"You have betrayed us."
"We are still searching."
"Give me the chance."
"That never works."
"And I did it."
"We came to work."
"It's going to fly."
"I've been tricked."
"Dad left."
"I have a home."
"I want half."
"You don't need to say it."
"I want a kiss."
"You are very thoughtful."
"They had an accident."
"Yes, it will be."
"I came with him."
"That's how you get high."
"Dad loves you."
"Give me a pen."
"You're not him."
"Yes, it is interesting."
"All in one."
"Where will you go then?"
"I've won it."
"Not by birth."
"For the truck."
"Now is the time."
"Improves security."
"Hey, please."
"Tell the judge."
"I have wonderful news."
"The party continues."
"Well, you were right."
"To the colony."
"Two at most."
"Hey, I love you."
"Remember where you are."
"See you later, Mom."
"OK that's fine."
"Much, much better."
"For you, tomorrow."
"Very well, good."
"Thanks for the food."
"Let's get something to eat."
"The night is young."
"A couple of days."
"A couple of hours."
"A couple of times."
"A couple of months."
"It's the only way."
"Now it all makes sense."
"Then don't do it."
"I'm sure you do."
"That was very good."
"You've heard it before."
"I already realized."
"I've noticed."
"And you can say it like that."
"Don't say those things."
"I'm not a child."
"A couple of weeks."
"At your service, sir."
"Yes, I'll tell him."
"I've always loved you."
"You just don't understand."
"This is very strange."
"It's the perfect time."
"I'll do whatever you want."
"I'll be in my office."
"That's my business."
"It's in the bathroom."
"This is a dream."
"That feels good."
"Do what I say."
"Thanks for dinner."
"That was an accident."
"You are now safe."
"It has been a pleasure."
"Today is my birthday."
"I love that song."
"That's very interesting."
"That's very sweet."
"That's so sweet."
"You have been very kind."
"Time's up."
"The party's over."
"Wish you all the best."
"I'm glad too."
"Neither of them."
"Yes, I realize."
"Now I realize."
"I've changed my mind."
"Thanks for the tea."
"Not as far as I know."
"Those are the rules."
"For heaven's sake."
"Something of the sort."
"It is not an option."
"I have made a decision."
"You've earned it."
"That's up to you."
"For old times' sake."
"One million dollars."
"Good afternoon everyone."
"Thanks for lunch."
"It's a good start."
"I've always known it."
"It's not going to work."
"That's the key."
"It will arrive any moment."
"At the end of the hall."
"The session is adjourned."
"You're going to be okay."
"I'm dying to."
"I am aware of this."
"Everyone to their posts."
"Let no one move."
"I have it all planned."
"Thanks for the invitation."
"May God bless you."
"I can reach any star."
"We must hurry."
"I'll take care of this."
"You're going to like it."
"That's a relief."
"Have a nice time."
"I already imagined it."
"The wave of the future."
"Show me all the plans."
"I'll explain it to you later."
"No offense intended."
"Don't get your hopes up."
"Don't change the subject."
"Praise the Lord."
"End of simulation."
"Make yourself at home."
"Watch your step."
"Blue flower, red thorns."
"It will only be a moment."
"This weekend."
"The way of the future."
"May God bless her."
"There's the door."
"I'm sorry about last night."
"It's been very good."
"It can be anything."
"It can't be far away."
"I want my mommy."
"This is going to work."
"You could say so."
"Of course I care."
"This is a business."
"But with one condition."
"I must talk to him."
"You know what it means."
"Same to you."
"Carefully, carefully."
"This is so much fun."
"That's much better."
"Thanks for the compliment."
"You're doing great."
"He is my son."
"I said I'm fine."
"I told him so."
"Order in the room."
"They will arrive any moment."
"Don't start again."
"I've always done it."
"I think we have it."
"You must be kidding."
"I think we're okay."
"Not even once."
"It's not good at all."
"It sure is."
"And there's something else."
"Happy birthday to you."
"The food is ready."
"He's in his room."
"Good night my love."
"Faster, faster."
"That's the best."
"You don't have to say it."
"I'm going to go."
"In due course."
"It's in the car."
"I've already tried it."
"It's just a moment."
"And let him say it."
"As if I cared."
"Let me see if I understand."
"This is your house."
"Just trust me."
"Nothing will happen to us."
"I propose you a deal."
"I like the way it sounds."
"I wasn't doing anything."
"Thanks for visiting."
"Look at that guy."
"This just in."
"I am in charge."
"Well, it's a start."
"I don't know anything anymore."
"This is very exciting."
"Thanks a million."
"I think I do."
"Yes, it is very good."
"I haven't had time."
"Everything seems to be fine."
"Tomorrow night."
"It will only be a second."
"He's in a meeting."
"That's the way it is."
"I knew you'd be here."
"It's a good business."
"I want it back."
"This is much better."
"That's not love."
"You're right about that."
"Thanks for the breakfast."
"Courtesy of the house."
"This is the moment."
"That's a good thing."
"I might do it."
"You have to eat something."
"These are their stories."
"You haven't done it."
"It will make you feel better."
"A couple of minutes."
"Talk to you later."
"I have to work tomorrow."
"This time is different."
"Good morning, good morning."
"I know what you feel."
"I've tried everything."
"I'm sorry my love."
"For your own sake."
"I can't allow that."
"It's me again."
"That's my girl."
"That's the way it has to be."
"Just what I thought."
"We're going to find him."
"Show me what you got."
"She is my mother."
"You can't go in there."
"It's a pleasure, sir."
"I'd never thought about it."
"Don't put your foot in it."
"It's okay my love."
"I know it is so."
"Yes, tell me about it."
"I still don't understand it."
"I thought I was with you."
"This is the captain speaking."
"I don't understand the question."
"Make way, please."
"It's the most important thing."
"Look who's come."
"I think I like it."
"It's most likely."
"I wish I had."
"Let's get it over with."
"She is the girl."
"Now to the left."
"You are right about that."
"This is very nice."
"You better not."
"It's a fair deal."
"He said he would be here."
"You're getting married."
"You heard him."
"To the other side."
"Long live the King."
"Now close your eyes."
"I know that guy."
"Permission to speak, sir."
"That's the good thing."
"I want to marry her."
"It has to be there."
"He's coming around."
"To tell the truth, yes."
"I have faith to believe."
"Be careful with the steps."
"Yes, I have seen it."
"This is between us."
"A couple of things."
"This is very good."
"Put yourself in their shoes."
"I take full responsibility."
"He means it."
"This is the police."
"These are my friends."
"Just one more time."
"I'm going to try."
"A farewell gift."
"I meant it."
"White in sight."
"I'm going to stay."
"They're going to be fine."
"There is enough for everyone."
"Of course you will."
"I got you, I got you."
"Merry Christmas to all."
"He's crazy."
"It's your last chance."
"Yes, it is very pretty."
"Yes, I like that."
"I can't allow it."
"The feeling is mutual."
"Yes, yes, that's right."
"Leave it on the ground."
"Hey, wait a second."
"Yes I am."
"You are waiting for a train."
"Please stand."
"Well, it was about time."
"Someday you'll understand."
"Nothing more than that."
"The session is open."
"You'd better come."
"You and I together."
"It is something very important."
"Better that it be so."
"Thanks for the chat."
"Don't turn around."
"It's a big surprise."
"I'll be late for work."
"Yes, I say the same."
"God bless you, son."
"There it goes again."
"He always does the same thing."
"At least I think so."
"Oh, yes, yes, yes."
"You can't hear anything."
"That's our man."
"You're making fun of me."
"Yes, that's good."
"I like your hat."
"A couple of years."
"Let's go for them."
"That's my mother."
"This is something else."
"It is a unique opportunity."
"Good morning everyone."
"I'll tell you what I'll do."
"From beginning to end."
"Down to the last detail."
"Hello, thanks for coming."
"It's been a lot of fun."
"First thing tomorrow morning."
"It's the third time."
"I can't be here."
"I'll see you on Monday."
"Now is your chance."
"That's very easy."
"Nobody has seen her."
"Everything is settled now."
"That's very strange."
"I like my job."
"I'm not hungry anymore."
"I'll do whatever I want."
"Seriously, I'm fine."
"It has to be now."
"It's a great story."
"But he won't."
"Stay in the boat."
"If I have to."
"As quickly as possible."
"That's the game."
"All kinds of things."
"That's the guy."
"Get into bed."
"The stakes are high."
"It's a small world."
"It's the best part."
"You are correct."
"Be careful with the door."
"Nobody has to know."
"This is so exciting."
"I've already seen it."
"Nobody has done it."
"But things change."
"It is the only solution."
"There it is again."
"The same as you."
"Yes you do."
"That's my seat."
"I always wanted to do that."
"Today is his birthday."
"I will marry her."
"Open the safe."
"The great white buffalo."
"It's the best time."
"This just arrived."
"A glass of water."
"We'll talk in the morning."
"You are in the air."
"It's fine by me."
"Further to the left."
"Just for a while."
"I can't hear anything."
"The sleeper must wake up."
"Ah, yes, yes, yes."
"I wish you good night."
"Now we are at peace."
"My mom did it."
"Things are going well."
"I left him a message."
"A little water."
"I want to make a toast."
"I think we'll be fine."
"Yes, it's about time."
"I'll ask the questions."
"Thanks for the party."
"And that's okay."
"It's the latest fashion."
"You've always done it."
"I am a free man."
"Tomorrow morning."
"Let me give you a hint."
"I love that guy."
"So it's over."
"I must talk to her."
"It is a great pleasure."
"It's the only option."
"I know what you do."
"Well, that makes two of us."
"I'm coming after you."
"I think they are right."
"It's what you do."
"Of course not, dear."
"He's going to recover."
"I love that movie."
"I want to see that order."
"Ah, yes, of course."
"Your mom is right."
"That's my house."
"She will be safe."
"That's the way the world is."
"I want to go too."
"I decide that."
"You will do very well."
"I'm in the city."
"All right, see you."
"It's just the beginning."
"Don't take it personally."
"It's in the bedroom."
"I can't leave."
"Here, it's for you."
"I like it, I like it."
"By all the saints."
"It's what you wanted."
"A dream come true."
"I'll do it right now."
"That's the law."
"Yes, she is fine."
"That's my dad."
"You were absolutely right."
"Thank you, you are very kind."
"She is my girlfriend."
"I know that man."
"I hope this works."
"Yes, I already knew that."
"It's a true story."
"You can't be sure."
"Honestly, I don't know."
"Yes he did."
"There's a cat in here."
"Well, I hope not."
"I think you're great."
"These are for you."
"It's your first time."
"I'm already on it."
"It is a beautiful place."
"This is over now."
"You dropped this."
"Enter the house."
"You'd better come in."
"I have to let you go."
"Of course he will."
"God, I hope not."
"I have very good news."
"But now it's different."
"Of course I like it."
"I thought you liked it."
"I'm going to make coffee."
"He's in the car."
"The sun is rising."
"The sun is coming out."
"Many years have passed."
"Now I understand everything."
"That's my wife."
"They have a lot to learn."
"I told you before."
"All right, I got it."
"He is quite a gentleman."
"The games are over."
"That's what I have."
"Someone has been here."
"It's what you are."
"I haven't heard it."
"You said you liked it."
"That's right, that's right."
"I have learned my lesson."
"This is very heavy."
"But this is important."
"And I want to be rich."
"I don't think he's coming."
"I will sell this house today."
"It's what I am."
"As if you cared."
"The bridge is near."
"Yes, I can imagine."
"I'm going to find you."
"I'll be in my room."
"I've come for you."
"I think I'm leaving."
"Nothing that matters to you."
"I know I have it."
"This is Red Two."
"And so much so."
"I realize now."
"You're crazy."
"But it can't be."
"That has to be it."
"This is real."
"I like your shoes."
"I hope he does."
"That would be very nice."
"I've seen her before."
"It's a big step."
"We'll come up with something."
"Very well, thank you very much."
"You can't leave now."
"I'm in a bind."
"I think he should leave."
"This is for me."
"I know what he says."
"Yes it does."
"It's time to breathe."
"I was thinking about that."
"Something occurs to me."
"Yes, and you too."
"I'm still not sure."
"It's a good place."
"Let's fix this."
"The same thing always happens."
"We'll call the police."
"You're leaving here."
"I have everything here."
"This is our bed."
"Yes, I told him so."
"I'm an old friend."
"Things are looking up."
"Children are children."
"They have only one option."
"I think it is possible."
"This looks good."
"That makes perfect sense."
"This is priceless."
"There it is, there it is."
"He is talking on the phone."
"They call you on the phone."
"That's the point."
"You haven't said anything."
"Of course, my friend."
"A cup of coffee."
"We'll keep in touch."
"This is the bathroom."
"Hey, I have to go."
"It's a small town."
"This is where we live."
"I'm a nobody."
"Yes, everything is going well."
"I hope it's important."
"I'm going for a beer."
"Holy Mother of God."
"This is what I mean."
"That's water under the bridge."
"Yes it was."
"The job is yours."
"I'm going to let you go."
"Look who's there."
"I'm by your side."
"Then I'll do it."
"It seems like it was yesterday."
"Born to be kings."
"I like that better."
"This is the latest."
"I'll make sure of that."
"That's what they pay him for."
"I only work here."
"You are within your rights."
"And you to me."
"It's in my house."
"They have already done it."
"It depends on the person."
"But thanks for coming."
"Look closer."
"Yes, I remember now."
"Please, Your Majesty."
"What happened, happened."
"Now he's gone."
"It's more than enough."
"That's my mom."
"I hope I didn't wake you up."
"That's my specialty."
"You know what they're like."
"I'll give you your money back."
"There won't be much left."
"I know why now."
"I will do it too."
"I need you to go."
"Well, I'll tell him."
"All right, I'm off."
"The fun is over."
"I've been looking for it."
"I start to think."
"One and all."
"Nobody comes in or out."
"I've earned it."
"It's our last chance."
"This is a test."
"It's in my pocket."
"I've already made my decision."
"It all depends on that."
"Let's go for a coffee."
"I'm okay with that."
"I've heard it all."
"I've thought about that."
"I need to use the bathroom."
"He's in the shower."
"It's part of the business."
"I can talk to him."
"I'm going on vacation."
"You should talk to her."
"After so many years."
"I hope you know."
"I think I'm learning."
"We'll see you very soon."
"Yes, you look good."
"I know this from experience."
"They look great."
"It's what we are."
"I'm sure you will."
"That's a good observation."
"It means a lot to us."
"That's the way the rules are."
"I can't say more."
"You already know it."
"That's a start."
"It's not like that anymore."
"Well, we have to go."
"Return to your homes."
"You are a great magician."
"He is a lovely man."
"Live long and prosper."
"Listen to your baby."
"I'm very glad."
"I've heard of him."
"Arrives just in time."
"That's how things are."
"He's in good shape."
"That's what I pay you for."
"Life is good."
"Testing, one, two, three."
"Life is like that."
"Not in a thousand years."
"Good night, sweet prince."
"No one will notice the difference."
"We're going to your house."
"You haven't seen anything."
"Get back in line."
"It better be good."
"I think you're exaggerating."
"I have matters to attend to."
"It was many years ago."
"Give me your best shot."
"I've never liked it."
"This came for you."
"Hey, that's mine."
"Just give me a chance."
"Long years have passed."
"She is the chosen one."
"Yes I did."
"Thanks for the book."
"He is wise and powerful."
"It's a good match."
"I want to make a game."
"You owe him your loyalty."
"How hot it is here."
"It's already on its way."
"You have to do better."
"I like that song."
"Thank you for the opportunity."
"I already did it."
"Such a tiny thing."
"I'll go as soon as I can."
"I do it very well."
"Everybody up."
"Not even the slightest."
"She saw nothing."
"I want to ask you some questions."
"Now everything is different."
"That's all, folks."
"They always have."
"I'm new to this."
"I'll go to the police."
"It's behind you."
"A star is born."
"That's not it."
"This is a surprise."
"Give me your other hand."
"I'm going there now."
"You arrived just in time."
"I did it for me."
"Good boy, good boy."
"And now it's here."
"Everything happened so fast."
"You're quite a man."
"Captain on the bridge."
"We'd better get out of here."
"This is your moment."
"These are our children."
"The boy is right."
"I'm not a boy."
"I asked him a question."
"So much depends on you."
"We have to do this."
"I swear I will."
"I think he will."
"Please pay attention."
"I called you twice."
"I must speak to you."
"This one's for you."
"This is serious stuff."
"Let's go to the party."
"I mean you."
"I'm sure I will."
"You have a good soul."
"We can go home."
"I'm seeing someone."
"It's not over yet."
"Nobody can do that."
"Needless to say."
"Two against the world."
"I understand it very well."
"I want you to accept it."
"What does it refer to?"
"You are in love with her."
"I'm going to eat something."
"Thank you for meeting with me."
"Not for me, thanks."
"I'll see you around."
"Our gift to the world."
"This is so beautiful."
"Call me when you have it."
"You don't owe him anything."
"I'll call my lawyer."
"It wouldn't hurt me."
"I think it's sweet."
"This means nothing."
"Well, thanks for coming."
"Good evening and thank you."
"I would really appreciate it."
"I can cross the field."
"I like that name."
"Yes, I'm fine, thank you."
"I invite you to eat."
"Stay by my side."
"I thank you."
"Your father would be proud."
"He's a big fish."
"Let me guess."
"He likes women."
"It's out of place."
"It was a pleasure seeing you."
"It was nice seeing you."
"It's for the kids."
"I'm getting old."
"All right, listen up everyone."
"I'm sorry about before."
"Yes, now I remember."
"Give me my daughter."
"The line was cut off."
"Just one more day."
"Besides a miracle."
"I have met someone."
"You're better than that."
"Follow the white rabbit."
"I'll take her home."
"He is getting on the tram."
"I need to know the truth."
"I bought you a gift."
"I think it will be fun."
"Thanks for the album."
"They're going to find you."
"You know how to find me."
"You know exactly where it ends."
"But it does to me."
"Just one minute."
"It's my last day."
"God, I don't know."
"Excuse me, excuse me."
"See you on Tuesday."
"It's my wife's."
"He was a great guy."
"I'll keep him."
"I'll get you out of there."
"I know her very well."
"Look who's saying it."
"And so he did."
"Well, we'll see each other."
"I'll take it to her."
"I'll take it to you."
"For me it is."
"That looks good."
"That's so romantic."
"Now it's fine."
"To tell the time."
"I like this music."
"Just doing his job."
"Yes, all night."
"I have given my word."
"My God, look at that."
"That's not him."
"This is a game."
"Think about your future."
"And you have my bow."
"It will be a pleasure, sir."
"I used to eat there."
"The children are fine."
"Let's figure this out."
"I'm good at that."
"They know what they're doing."
"That's my dream."
"That's really good."
"Yes, very well, thank you."
"I want my phone call."
"You're good at that."
"It's a good argument."
"Get behind me."
"That money is mine."
"We are on the air."
"Your clothes are different."
"Let me see my calendar."
"They have very good noodles."
"My parents are upstairs."
"Very well, see you later."
"They're going to catch you."
"Victory was approaching."
"That's why I say it."
"Let's come to an agreement."
"I have everything thought out."
"I'm happy to see you."
"Make way, make way."
"I had a minor accident."
"Nor I to you."
"We can make it work."
"I hope you do."
"Wait, wait a second."
"It's just one night."
"You already know that way."
"You can't come here."
"That's what it was all about."
"She is very sweet."
"You're a smart boy."
"The controls are not responding."
"You've already taken half."
"I wrote that program."
"That's a good sign."
"It was a great night."
"All right, come here."
"Only women and children."
"An elderly gentleman."
"You must leave here."
"I can't be sure."
"Your parents are here."
"Lower the ship there."
"Better than sex."
"Go to the house."
"Let's go to the city."
"The money is here."
"Good job, good job."
"That's fine by me."
"Everyone to their places."
"I wonder a lot of things."
"Clean eating, please."
"I work for myself."
"I've never been."
"I can't read them."
"Travel only during the day."
"It's in the city."
"It's like a computer."
"They're going to track him."
"And he didn't."
"He's starting to believe."
"It happens when they change something."
"One big happy family."
"You cannot enter."
"No matter how brave he is."
"Not like this."
"I'll keep her."
"All right, let's get to work."
"A year has passed."
"The Bible says so."
"You bet it does."
"I met his father."
"Let's do something more fun."
"Come, give me a kiss."
"I need an exit, now."
"You're going to make it."
"This is a robbery."
"You've been very quiet."
"A child's play."
"I can't go there."
"I go Tuesday and Thursday."
"It depends on the mind."
"Not with those words."
"The deal sounds excellent."
"Onions have layers."
"I've been through that."
"I've been through that before."
"The last human city."
"The truth is yes."
"Stay on the floor."
"Yes, wait a minute."
"A job well done."
"Now it's up to you."
"Faster than anyone."
"I'll be back in the morning."
"I can't think of anything."
"But you don't know."
"I think I can fix it."
"It's a great job."
"It's our charger program."
"It never has been."
"The table is set."
"If such a thing exists."
"You already know the rules."
"Go to the right."
"I wanted to talk to you about that."
"I think he heard you."
"The tribe has spoken."
"Welcome home, sir."
"I'm the only one here."
"So, that's it."
"It has to be close."
"My sincere apologies."
"You slept with him."
"I've been thinking about you."
"The police will arrive soon."
"They can't leave."
"I like it better that way."
"Chicken, for example."
"That's the man."
"Most people think that."
"It happens with milk."
"The squid comes flying."
"I searched everywhere."
"Your passport please."
"You're better than him."
"I see what I wish."
"Please sit there."
"You have to try this."
"I've always liked it."
"We will go through the mines."
"Since I saw you."
"I owe you one, friend."
"Leave her out of this."
"Here's the thing."
"Again, please."
"It is a first edition."
"Watch where you're going."
"It's a direct order."
"We can take other paths."
"I'm back home."
"And together we catch killers."
"Right rudder."
"And it gets better."
"I finally found you."
"That's the past."
"I'm going to do this."
"I hope I'm not interrupting."
"When the war is over."
"It is what it seems."
"I know what her name is."
"You dance all night."
"I'll send horses for you."
"This is totally different."
"They can't prove anything."
"I blew it."
"It's good luck."
"I'm just another guy."
"It's your father's."
"Be careful with the suit."
"The only one who survived."
"I want a second opinion."
"Yes, that's better."
"It's at the door."
"I'm going to fix this."
"That's my boy."
"I'll tell him tomorrow."
"And I told him so."
"You're a tough guy."
"I won't say a word."
"That's how work is."
"We'll talk about this later."
"Just coffee, please."
"He's in college."
"I can't understand it."
"We have to solve this."
"I already talked to him."
"That's the wonderful thing."
"I don't know, son."
"They can't be here."
"It's a man's thing."
"I think I'll be fine."
"It was two years ago."
"On the ground floor."
"That is our path."
"Time is of the essence."
"Yes, I like it very much."
"Just as I feared."
"It's an interesting theory."
"The surgery went well."
"Everything is going to change."
"It's moving fast."
"They laugh at me."
"It was my dad's."
"You'll be safe here."
"Here is your photo."
"Be careful, both of you."
"We'll do the rest."
"They have been very kind."
"Thank the gods."
"It's one of mine."
"I took care of that."
"I hope you are well."
"Oh my God, look at this."
"I like the way you think."
"We have to fix this."
"It's on the roof."
"Now everything is fine."
"We are from the police."
"The forests, the fields."
"Just one more question."
"Someone took her."
"This is the Structure."
"This feels good."
"I've already found out."
"You have to do it yourself."
"They did very well."
"That's how you've always been."
"It is the latest model."
"I don't think you should."
"I'm going to look for it."
"I thought you'd be here."
"Wear whatever you want."
"Now is our chance."
"Thanks for the support."
"A work of art."
"We are getting closer to our goal."
"Calmly, calmly."
"He's in the office."
"You are a good daughter."
"Well done, well done."
"There has been an incident."
"I'll just be a minute."
"I am a lucky man."
"You don't even try."
"Nobody has asked you."
"For making it count."
"I'm going to grab you."
"Yes, it is the best."
"Everything happened very quickly."
"Wait here a moment."
"That's what I feel."
"Now, to bed."
"The house is surrounded."
"Very good, very good."
"That's my car."
"I'm very busy now."
"Only on special occasions."
"This is a party."
"Your mother is here."
"This place is fantastic."
"A cup of tea."
"The best of all."
"I'm going to make tea."
"You are an incredible woman."
"Our children are here."
"Fair is fair."
"A little stronger."
"Because of who I am."
"Sit on the couch."
"Just a tea, thank you."
"I asked you for something."
"Six months have passed."
"Not for a minute."
"Right hand, please."
"It is a delicate situation."
"These are my groups."
"The light of day."
"And I want it now."
"It's a new car."
"I just came to say hello."
"More of the same."
"I'm not going to argue."
"The intruders found them."
"Because I've seen them."
"I go on Saturdays."
"I mean this."
"My dream come true."
"I know, it's okay."
"Every last cent."
"I just remembered something."
"You are my girl."
"The ayes have it."
"He's going to do it."
"One for the road."
"Go back to your place."
"That's very funny."
"He's a nobody."
"I will, I promise."
"All right, all right."
"I learned it from you."
"Give me one of those."
"It will be a great party."
"You look so beautiful."
"I like books."
"You are a good brother."
"You look very well."
"I can still fix this."
"We are safe now."
"Let's go at once."
"Tomatoes, sausages, browned bacon."
"They should be here by now."
"It's a good reason."
"I'll see you very soon."
"It's a great country."
"Well, someone did."
"Which is fine."
"I want to take a look."
"I can't hear this."
"I've been waiting for this."
"See you on Thursday."
"Sorry, you're right."
"Come here right now."
"We are on our own."
"I'm talking to him."
"It's the second time."
"Those were his words."
"They took her away."
"It will be the last time."
"I know what to do now."
"I'm sorry, my love."
"I think you like it."
"It's time to celebrate."
"Throughout my life."
"Just wait and see."
"Half past eleven."
"That's the way out."
"It's in your pocket."
"That's our signal."
"I told you I would come."
"And the next day."
"You're a great guy."
"Thank you very much for having me."
"Did you call the police."
"Good work everyone."
"They are turning around."
"They are looking at the house."
"Yes, we already ate one."
"I think it's true."
"You better be."
"It is more than likely."
"This is the good one."
"Attention, all units."
"It's my last chance."
"Welcome home, friend."
"I like your suit."
"You better close the door."
"In the same way."
"You think you're very clever."
"Only if you want."
"Nobody likes it."
"Now you work for me."
"You look much better."
"The time is now."
"They have my son."
"I like talking to you."
"Everybody out."
"I'm back for you."
"There's something out there."
"Put it in a bag."
"Oh, yes, I remember now."
"Of the best quality."
"Let's go to the library."
"It's a good time."
"She is nobody."
"Let it be very clear."
"That hasn't changed."
"Follow your heart."
"It's a great thing."
"Come to the office."
"It's my mom's."
"I'm glad to know that."
"Times are tough."
"That guy is amazing."
"Not at that time."
"I know they will."
"It's just a minute."
"Now let's talk."
"But thanks for asking."
"It was a quiet night."
"Come and sit here."
"I just said that."
"Here's your money."
"You heard what I said."
"Something will occur to us."
"They're going to see us."
"Go back to the house."
"The rest is history."
"Class is over."
"Let's go for a beer."
"I'm in bed."
"I'll give you five minutes."
"He is crossing the street."
"It is the best option."
"That changes things."
"I must return home."
"We have to be sure."
"I don't decide that."
"Don't open that door."
"I have to keep working."
"Just give me your hand."
"Get out of here, spirit."
"This is a lot of money."
"Until the last breath."
"That's the last one."
"I think you are beautiful."
"To the airport, please."
"It's a good photo."
"I'm not responsible for him."
"I have spoken to him."
"They said it was okay."
"They are a young species."
"Sleeps like a baby."
"It's never going to happen."
"Why do you do that?"
"It's my husband's."
"Well, that's interesting."
"I saw it on television."
"It's for television."
"It's a good piece."
"Yes, ma'am, that's right."
"There's someone out there."
"That's what I'll do."
"We want to talk to him."
"A movie star."
"The same old story."
"It's in the lab."
"It is, it is."
"I can't argue with that."
"I said it was okay."
"Your father is here."
"Let me talk to her."
"Great kings of men."
"First Officer's Diary."
"You've been here for a month."
"It's a good opportunity."
"We have to act quickly."
"Come on, everything is fine."
"That's very exciting."
"They are my best friends."
"I love that name."
"That's my place."
"Nobody has to find out."
"But I wasn't."
"It's an interesting question."
"This is what I meant."
"It's going to be tough."
"You're off the case."
"The one on the right."
"Let's go to the house."
"I've been waiting for it."
"We'll be home soon."
"You can take off your mask."
"The will of God."
"And thank you for coming."
"I'm going to enjoy this."
"I was referring to myself."
"All thanks to you."
"I know what he does."
"That's what we came for."
"Yes, that's what I've heard."
"I'll stay here with you."
"That's a yes."
"His intentions are good."
"Let me pass, please."
"I'm used to that."
"I have a good lawyer."
"We had it all planned."
"They think you left."
"You look very pretty today."
"Well, nobody's perfect."
"Let me see your hand."
"I like your tits."
"Not as much as this."
"Take her to the station."
"We have to move fast."
"Do something about it."
"It's in your mind."
"I'm going to find it."
"I've always said so."
"This is destiny."
"It's a good bet."
"Many people do."
"You look good, friend."
"This is your doing."
"I like ice."
"Look at that woman."
"They are in the basement."
"It better work."
"We have to do it right."
"Hey, don't do that."
"Wait, I want to talk to you."
"You're a lost cause."
"Clear as day."
"It's a great song."
"It's a good program."
"There's always a catch."
"But that's over."
"You have a lot to explain."
"On the third floor."
"Of course there is."
"It's not a good sign."
"That's my brother."
"This is a piece of cake."
"This is something new."
"Yes, wait a second."
"You know what it is."
"I wanted to know how you were."
"One day, they will have dreams."
"I'll be out in a moment."
"Not one step further."
"It's in the room."
"My conscience is clear."
"Of course, man."
"He's on the tram."
"It's not very likely."
"That's the sign."
"Do it your way."
"How beautiful this is."
"You talk to him."
"Here you go again."
"It can happen to anyone."
"Take one of these."
"Accept it like a man."
"He is using the Voice."
"I never saw it that way."
"I'm going to catch you."
"I should have realized."
"Right in the center."
"We want you to be happy."
"Fast and silent."
"I hope that's enough."
"Ashes to ashes."
"Welcome to war."
"I've just got up."
"It's a great occasion."
"You've heard him."
"It's gotten late."
"Even to our dreams."
"You will never be again."
"There has to be more."
"We ask the questions."
"We'll take care of this."
"For all eternity."
"They're going to do it."
"And it always will be."
"Gift from the house."
"I see great potential."
"I don't even like it."
"We'll start from the beginning."
"A gift from God."
"I have a phone."
"Then don't say anything."
"I hope you find them."
"For good luck."
"Do it anyway."
"Yes, sir, I will."
"This place is perfect."
"That's all, sir."
"Read it aloud."
"I'll be back in a bit."
"And one for you."
"I'm going to fuck you up."
"And she to me."
"Please take this."
"I'm late for class."
"I think you are wonderful."
"They say it might snow."
"It's easier this way."
"Yes you did."
"I still don't believe it."
"Everyone calm down."
"I love green."
"I'll go for it."
"Yes, that's great."
"Yes, I feel fine."
"The truth is, it is."
"Get out of the rain."
"He asked for it."
"Come, I want to show you something."
"The power went out."
"The same as always."
"Let me see if I understood."
"I have seen the future."
"I've been thinking about that."
"Yes, yes, I understand."
"Thank you for your letter."
"You're the best, Dad."
"You are always hungry."
"That is priceless."
"Yes, it has been."
"It's my favorite song."
"Going home."
"He deserves our gratitude."
"It was a long number."
"I'm not your father."
"It's all right, honey."
"It turned out very well."
"You're like my brother."
"It's the back door."
"That's why I do it."
"Let's go back to bed."
"It's a great relief."
"Medicine is for goat."
"You're in my house."
"This is my friend."
"Go away at once."
"Stronger, stronger."
"Clear as water."
"That's my man."
"Okay, come here."
"It's very good to see you."
"Now that I think about it."
"Call your mom."
"I'll give you everything."
"There is a door here."
"I hope you like them."
"I'll make you a deal."
"They didn't do it."
"Don't use that word."
"They will give you a medal."
"Same here, please."
"Your wife is right."
"I can see why."
"I'll pay you double."
"We have made a deal."
"I thought it was clear."
"I'll see you on board."
"Come see me tomorrow."
"I wish you the best of luck."
"I've never touched it."
"Just open the door."
"We can make a deal."
"Dad, it's for you."
"It was my mom's."
"I can't leave now."
"I suggest you apologize."
"I'm going to give it to you."
"It is a beautiful house."
"All units advance."
"It's never going to work."
"We'll be safe here."
"It is a real pleasure."
"He seems like a good man."
"That doesn't interest you."
"I can make them say hello."
"It's my stage name."
"You have to sign here."
"Just like the others."
"It's on the ground."
"It's our first date."
"It's a very serious matter."
"I already have the money."
"The Trojan Sword."
"It was only once."
"I have to see that."
"I got you into this."
"She is a friend."
"Don't be left behind."
"He's out of his mind."
"I'll save it for you."
"They are going to evaluate you."
"I have someone better."
"I love that car."
"You have very good taste."
"I love that show."
"Think about your child."
"This house is ours."
"Go to the office."
"You have to be prepared."
"This is getting good."
"It has to be her."
"You could say yes."
"How kind of you to come."
"The boy is fine."
"Nobody noticed."
"Finally we get results."
"I'll say it again."
"Don't think about anything."
"I like your necklace."
"Happy birthday to me."
"I am the greatest."
"Come to the kitchen."
"Wow, he's really fast."
"I won't be there."
"I hope it's true."
"We will be eternally grateful."
"I will send you a copy."
"Certainly not here."
"Good morning, USA."
"I do my part."
"I forgot about that."
"This is my moment."
"She won't do it."
"Everything is going well here."
"Everything is fine here."
"Thank you very much for calling."
"Not a second more."
"Let me see, let me see."
"We'll go to my house."
"That's what love is like."
"I was this close."
"Don't ask so many questions."
"Breakfast in bed."
"We go to church."
"She has a nice butt."
"We have to be strong."
"I know what that's like."
"That's what it does."
"I guess I got lucky."
"We are at your house."
"See, I told you."
"And thanks to you."
"It's a wonderful day."
"Put it in the glove compartment."
"He's been through a lot."
"I've never thought about it."
"You've been very good."
"This needs to be repeated."
"They're my dad's."
"It's very dark here."
"Well, that's different."
"She is the boss."
"Before the rain."
"Stay in that booth."
"It's what you want."
"Go get something to eat."
"Admiral, we are in position."
"I'm in heaven."
"I'll give him the message."
"This is the number."
"I want to make a statement."
"I'm going to take you."
"My gift to you."
"There must be some reason."
"This time I'll make it."
"We can talk about this."
"I can't right now."
"That wasn't love."
"But these are new."
"Keep talking to someone."
"It's a reasonable question."
"But not by phone."
"To what follows."
"I'm out of practice."
"Now we are a family."
"I know that boy."
"But it does to you."
"You'll figure it out."
"Now it's all over."
"I left him a note."
"Don't trust her."
"And he won't."
"It happens to anyone."
"You have jobs, a life."
"I'm a good boy."
"My head is exploding."
"I was already leaving."
"Don't call her that."
"Thank you, thank you all."
"She was wearing a white dress."
"That was a lot of fun."
"Well, now you know."
"This place is wonderful."
"Let's go to that house."
"Do what you must."
"It's the last chance."
"The kitchen is clear."
"I love that place."
"He wants to make a deal."
"Nobody can recognize it."
"He has stopped breathing."
"Well, it's my job."
"Aim for the legs."
"This is an order."
"Never in my life."
"That stays too?"
"Let's talk about something important."
"The Queen wishes it."
"I'll tell you a story."
"He is with his father."
"I don't want to do it."
"I don't do those things."
"You'll think of something."
"I'm thinking about that."
"Now, don't move."
"Everything is going smoothly."
"Let's go for a drink."
"You have to do this."
"They are part of me."
"Yes, sir, yes, sir."
"But he'll be fine."
"My mother is sick."
"I like him very much."
"Right between the eyes."
"You look like her."
"I'll go for the votes."
"The ring has awakened."
"I'm going up the stairs."
"I have felt it."
"You know more than that."
"My father was a writer."
"Take it easy, buddy."
"It's her again."
"I can't go in there."
"Indeed, that is the case."
"That's the place."
"I think it was."
"Well, yes, to me."
"I've already seen you."
"I'm going to let it go."
"Then I won't do it."
"This was hers."
"All right, good night."
"That's my life."
"I have to go downstairs."
"There is a lot to see."
"Peace in the world."
"That was a sign."
"I feel good now."
"I'm going to do that."
"Please let me out."
"This is your night."
"That's why you pay us."
"Yes, very seriously."
"I agree, sir."
"That's your name."
"He knew who I was."
"It becomes an addiction."
"Better you than me."
"But now I'm fine."
"It's a great night."
"He is your father."
"I'll ask you a question."
"Yes, he is fine."
"He's one of the good ones."
"There's something down here."
"I will remain standing."
"It's going to cost you."
"He knows you are."
"You can and you will."
"Son, open your eyes."
"I'm very well."
"Yes, among other things."
"I love my dad."
"You've been very lucky."
"Whatever, man."
"Go south."
"This is the important thing."
"I decided not to park here."
"It won't be the same."
"There's the key."
"Now I know everything."
"Wait a minute, honey."
"That's the situation."
"Eat a little more."
"You are quite the gentleman."
"So he left."
"Yes, I have it here."
"This room is green."
"Thank you so much for coming."
"Five, you start to wake up."
"Good night, good night."
"You're right, we need reinforcements."
"They all had it inside."
"That's my price."
"Come with me for a second."
"Now I understand why."
"It has to be here."
"It's quite a detail."
"May God bless us."
"And proud to be one."
"I'll take a shower."
"Clearly not."
"He just wants to talk to you."
"The house is ours."
"A question of etiquette."
"It's in the forest."
"It's in the briefcase."
"I want to have a child."
"Goodbye to both of you."
"Now you are a man."
"Keep him talking."
"Probably from last year."
"I'm going to finish you off."
"Thank you, that's all."
"It is a matter of taking up arms."
"Let's go to the table."
"You tell me about it."
"If they come."
"The greatness of Rome."
"I know what we'll do."
"But now I know."
"Now I remember everything."
"Victory is ours."
"That's the system."
"Well, I'll tell you something."
"Code red, code red."
"That's where it is."
"Of course I love her."
"This is a miracle."
"It's a good coat."
"As soon as you can."
"I've had a lot of work."
"Okay, we have to go."
"Only the right side."
"All lights off."
"Everything is fine, son."
"To the last drop."
"I guess you know."
"Get on with your life."
"I'll go get my things."
"You look so good."
"Indeed, it is."
"Our relationship is over."
"This has happened before."
"It's a dog thing."
"Six months have already passed."
"I have seen her."
"We can and we will."
"You will feel much better."
"There are a lot of people approaching."
"These are my dreams."
"Yes, it is very nice."
"Come on, give me a hug."
"Best of three."
"This is a war."
"Firm as a rock."
"I know it will be."
"It's an important decision."
"I said 'I promise you'."
"You'll come up with something."
"I can work with that."
"Have sweet dreams."
"Not to be trusted."
"He is not trustworthy."
"But now you're here."
"I want to go with mom."
"Just give me a moment."
"But he knew."
"Through the main door."
"Please cancel this."
"I guess I did."
"He shouldn't be here."
"That's the trick."
"I like the place."
"Next to his chest."
"It's in the building."
"You and your friend."
"Since we were children."
"It's better than working."
"As if he cared."
"I think it's fantastic."
"Get on the bed."
"Keep the return."
"Not in my house."
"Yes, I have seen them."
"I don't know, sergeant."
"Put on some clothes."
"We'll do it later."
"You must be careful now."
"Your next life, maybe."
"Not a single thing."
"I think I like you."
"Yes they do."
"I married him."
"I can't talk anymore."
"Go to your posts."
"We are all friends here."
"I'm on the bridge."
"I have an exam tomorrow."
"I know you don't know."
"They want to change things."
"It's the safest thing to do."
"He comes with us."
"That's my girlfriend."
"Thank you very much for waiting."
"Smile at the camera."
"Keep doing your thing."
"I see it like this."
"I thought I would."
"She has my son."
"I'm making a list."
"Yes, I trust you."
"I don't think about that."
"Call your boss."
"But very well."
"You have to be realistic."
"That can't be it."
"It's a good track."
"You and no one else."
"The sofa is fine."
"If that is possible."
"Everyone has done it."
"Not on my watch."
"I wanted to see how you were."
"I'll stick with that."
"That's not yours."
"Thirty-six hours."
"It will be much easier."
"That's right, Your Honor."
"It's what I expected."
"Here is the order."
"Yes, I imagined it."
"They have to be here."
"I'll buy you new clothes."
"You don't even know."
"Nine and a half years."
"I don't do it anymore."
"It was a glorious time."
"And with your spirit."
"To keep warm."
"Here comes the boss."
"That's what we were created for."
"Forty-five minutes."
"I try not to."
"It goes against the rules."
"You did good, kid."
"I'll be down in a moment."
"Call me when you hear this."
"My God, it's him."
"What an incredible thing."
"A crowd is approaching."
"Company policy."
"You have red eyes."
"I've waited a long time."
"Yes, it is very possible."
"He's got the girl."
"It's a great place."
"This is the thing."
"I think he's sleeping."
"It is an interesting case."
"Thanks, it's mine."
"You know what I'm saying."
"So that one can breathe."
"And I have done it."
"The kitten was fine."
"Don't ask why."
"Let's go for some ice cream."
"It's the last call."
"What is that for?"
"With eyes closed."
"This way it's faster."
"I'm going to call for reinforcements."
"He seems to like it."
"You're going to love them."
"It's my dad's."
"I want the same."
"I said it as a joke."
"Many men have tried."
"Behind a desk."
"For the first civilization."
"You know, I used steroids."
"Go with your mother."
"She was already perfect."
"It is a wonderful place."
"This or that."
"This got exciting."
"You can work for me."
"I'm with a friend."
"I need to go to work."
"I'm going to wait here."
"We'll talk at my house."
"You'll do very well."
"Six million in cash."
"You're lucky there."
"Everything at once."
"Well, good for him."
"Well, thanks for everything."
"This is the question."
"He was wearing his yellow tie."
"Your mom wants to see you."
"I have a wife and a son."
"You are the architect."
"I know what they did."
"My mom needs one."
"Try to look like a fighter."
"You always do the same thing."
"It starts again."
"Here is my son."
"So please."
"I want you to understand something."
"I know you'll like it."
"He already knows."
"Lifelong."
"Here is the coffee."
"I talked to that guy."
"This is a sign."
"One with a steady job."
"The one dressed in pink."
"That is our mission."
"But I gave my word."
"Not with mine."
"It could be anyone's."
"And just in time."
"I think it's working."
"I'm stepping back a little."
"Come, let's dance."
"They know all the tricks."
"Find your own girl."
"Get him out of here, quickly."
"Two years have passed."
"You've had your chance."
"We have a lot of that."
"I think it's fair."
"I want to do it again."
"I'll cut his throat."
"You're in my seat."
"There is a lot to buy."
"Well, that's fantastic."
"Stay with your mother."
"So move fast."
"To educate our children."
"I thought you were sleeping."
"You are the star."
"Three days have passed."
"You'll like the tiger."
"It goes against the law."
"Your mom calls you."
"Now open the door."
"Come and take me now."
"Well, I'm pretty sure."
"It was published in magazines."
"Everything will be okay, honey."
"They are prisons like hotels."
"Three years have passed."
"I hope it turns out better."
"I thought you'd say that."
"They need guys like me."
"That's how men are."
"It's a great moment."
"It better be."
"That's living."
"I hope it's soon."
"I bury those cockroaches."
"You dance like a faggot."
"Thanks to the Academy."
"The Spirit of the Forest."
"Control that dog."
"The Hunter's Moon."
"Go with your mom."
"But we have to talk."
"He was fighting, as a child."
"I'm glad to see it."
"Yes, actually yes."
"But first the stone."
"We will do the same."
"It's going to be interesting."
"You never did anything."
"And so it has been."
"I came here for you."
"Safe and without money."
"Police snitch."
"This is so good."
"What is the white one?"
"So, it suits you."
"He loves that dog."
"You already know who I am."
"It's a nice day."
"I'll buy you a new one."
"Look to the left."
"I like the name."
"You have seen it."
"Each one is different."
"It's a little strong."
"Only there you can put it."
"My son, the astronaut."
"The food is good."
"Yes you will."
"Look at that man."
"I'm in a good mood."
"Ah, yes, that's true."
"You're the one who's drugged."
"It's very good like this."
"Be careful with your arm."
"Get out of the house."
"A kiss, a kiss."
"That girl of his."
"I always liked you."
"I do like that."
"It's easy to remember."
"Pick up all your things."
"Sleep all day."
"I'll give it another chance."
"It will bring you good luck."
"Half of this."
"Well, that explains it."
"Join the party."
"It's always like this before."
"I want them to leave."
"Neither Irish nor English."
"You don't have to shout."
"I was on my way."
"They are playing with us."
"I'll give you half."
"But he has the briefcase."
"Glad I could help."
"One billion dollars."
"Well thank God."
"You are looking for a partner."
"They don't even speak English."
"Because I like you a lot."
"It's for my father."
"Memory of my girlfriend."
"Make an appointment beforehand."
"They'll need two more guys."
"Look at the dog."
"Seats and a steering wheel."
"I'll do whatever you say."
"Anything you want."
"Seriously, seriously."
"And I of you."
"I'll fix everything between us."
"To the Grey Ports."
"And talk about money."
"Look to the right."
"Yes, yes, here I go."
"I will reach the summit."
"I think this is where we start."
"It will be of little use to you."
"Let's discuss what he proposes."
"And do good business."
"I'm already pretty sweet."
"You can't prove anything."
"I'll go get the car."
"The party is upstairs."
"You look better here."
"You have to listen to this."
"A little bigger."
"Go, pay them and bring it."
"I carry a heavy load."
"I'll bring it to you tomorrow."
"Because he was so smart."
"This is how this country was born."
"I've seen him before."
"I just want to ask you something."
"I never fly without it."
"I heard he's still looking for me."
"It has helped us a lot."
"Come work with me."
"It's in the water."
"Everyone wanted to say it."
"I will take care of my investments."
"That's my decision."
"I'll be with you again."
"Say it once and for all."
"That's my bed."
"We'll see if you're tough."
"My son has disappeared."
"Stronger than ever."
"I've always wanted to go."
"I would like to ask you some questions."
"I've got your back, bro."
"Then it will be too late."
"I'll be on the bridge."
"It's time to go out."
"Sorry for calling so late."
"It's in the past."
"You have to talk to me."
"It's my sister's."
"This brings back memories."
"They are already doing it."
"Oh my God, please."
"Nature is extraordinary."
"I want to end this."
"At least not with me."
"Yes, it is very interesting."
"That is their reality."
"It's in the parking lot."
"I want to go shopping."
"It's good that you arrived."
"Whatever is necessary."
"This is the plan."
"It has been very interesting."
"Here is your coffee."
"I received the call."
"Here's something new."
"That's what marriage is like."
"People want to believe."
"It meant a lot to him."
"That's my friend."
"Everything's fine, my friend."
"Lord, hear our prayer."
"It was fun while it lasted."
"It all stays in the family."
"The heavens will open."
"Yes, in a moment."
"You are a great help."
"You must make a decision."
"If you please."
"Now we are safe."
"It depends on the circumstances."
"Police orders."
"There has been a robbery."
"Well, it's the same thing."
"This is something to celebrate."
"We talked about many things."
"And I remember everything."
"Nobody else knows."
"You say that."
"Do that again."
"You can come too."
"They must be around here."
"The house is clear."
"You're going to pay for it."
"See you again."
"I thought I was happy."
"Beautiful, very well cut."
"I have spoken to them."
"You have something to tell us."
"It's turning around."
"The negotiations were short."
"You're going to do it."
"I'm a generous guy."
"Here's something else."
"I'll teach you a lesson."
"For the love of God."
"It will be nice to have a change."
"But everything turned out well."
"We're on your side."
"Here comes the launch."
"It's as it should be."
"Wait in the lobby."
"The work is going well."
"I was in college."
"He will do very well."
"It's like a hobby."
"Thank you, my young friend."
"Then go home."
"You will be the first."
"Not much has changed."
"Anything could happen."
"I trust you completely."
"Let me see yours."
"From side to side."
"You are coming with us."
"On the way home."
"Left rudder."
"From day one."
"Here is your number."
"See you around here."
"Don't give up now."
"Nobody lives forever."
"You know it's like that."
"Between you and me."
"It's not going to come out."
"You're not going to arrive."
"Let's see what he does."
"Let's go somewhere else."
"That's a promise."
"I love your house."
"Good dog, good family."
"I'm thinking about you."
"And now, the conclusion."
"So here it is."
"If there is a game, it will come."
"As much as necessary."
"This is your life."
"The train is leaving."
"You made a decision."
"I don't think he understands."
"Promise me you will."
"Be careful with them."
"It is a beautiful city."
"You've always known."
"It is a Mexican brick."
"Five of the big ones."
"I'll see you early tomorrow."
"Just the way you like it."
"I never do it."
"That will be the day."
"You know it very well."
"Well, that's easy."
"Better go."
"There's someone in there."
"You did it again."
"It's good, as you say."
"My partner has it."
"The navy is still there."
"I can see their faces."
"We can start over."
"Life is fantastic."
"Now we use the brain."
"Back to the world."
"God bless you, sir."
"He has had an accident."
"Yes, I just started."
"Come and stay with me."
"Trust in your strength."
"And I always will."
"The clock is here."
"Here, in the building."
"I'll be back in a week."
"Your life is yours."
"Of course I know you."
"Patience, my blue friend."
"He's gone forever."
"As we all do."
"There you have the answer."
"In my entire life."
"I've been seeing things."
"You have it all planned."
"Well, a historical figure."
"From woman to woman."
"It's in the lobby."
"I'm going to figure this out."
"Yes, you are the boss."
"It will be out in a minute."
"I have to go, honey."
"I believe that too."
"The child is fine."
"He's talking to someone."
"I know we're close."
"Thanks for the push."
"We've come a long way."
"But I have to meet her."
"We are in business."
"I think about girls a lot."
"It is a big city."
"This explains everything."
"Something will occur to you."
"I have been reading poetry."
"That's where I live."
"Do it for the boys."
"Check the transmitter generator."
"But wait a minute."
"And in good condition."
"It's in the garage."
"This is as far as I go."
"I already thought about that."
"Be careful with the edge."
"Guess who wrote it."
"So that's it."
"One way in, one way out."
"Come on, give me a hand."
"One dollar bills."
"This is very beautiful."
"The food is served."
"Look at those guys."
"Now everything is clear."
"Another time, perhaps."
"That's not her."
"The rocket is ready."
"Great, they did it."
"We've got power back."
"This is so funny."
"She says yes."
"It is a great achievement."
"Look at all these things."
"I'm going in."
"Blue, it's the boy."
"Fine, I'll do it."
"In your cells, yes."
"I live near here."
"He's older than you."
"You've been doing that for years."
"You must complete the training."
"That was very fast."
"Come back to reality."
"Take a look, corporal."
"I know, I know."
"I see you are very quiet."
"I take you at your word."
"Whatever it was."
"Just for now."
"All week, son."
"They are a wonderful audience."
"You have a phone call."
"Let me clean this cut."
"We have to get another one."
"I have read your report."
"You look so pretty."
"Sorry, it's true."
"I'm just going to look."
"Permission to speak freely."
"We are in a cage."
"I think he fainted."
"I had to be sure."
"And I to you."
"I will show you the way."
"The instruments are fine."
"Do not send any transmissions."
"I need a good judge."
"They win this round."
"I have to make some calls."
"Do what it says."
"I did some work here."
"That was very funny."
"You'll understand very soon."
"We are the last two."
"I have all of his albums."
"But big, my friend."
"Saturday night."
"I love that word."
"Use your key now."
"Watch out for the heads."
"Just a few more minutes."
"Sir, I have a question."
"The people have decided."
"I'll tell you who they were."
"Love does not exist."
"This man is a doctor."
"Everyone to their stations."
"I did very well."
"I think someone is coming."
"I must get in shape."
"They are playing our song."
"Not while I'm around."
"Well, that was fun."
"It was a long night."
"You sound just like me."
"They are free to leave."
"What I say."
"The Resolute's desk."
"He has a beautiful house."
"Now it's all yours."
"He brought all the money."
"And something to eat."
"So you're here."
"I think it's amazing."
"I don't know, anything."
"Come, I'll show you something."
"He has you."
"This is more fun."
"I need to make some sales."
"You've never done it."
"It's a private conversation."
"But they won't."
"I have felt better."
"I expected more from you."
"Please, one moment."
"Now I'm fine."
"That was his job."
"The City of Gold."
"Me ahead, you back."
"Here ends the lesson."
"It's him, it's him."
"Tainted for life."
"One more, one more."
"I can't leave, Mom."
"I'm with a patient."
"They called the police."
"Unless you want to."
"You've got a lot of guts, boy."
"Please marry me."
"I haven't heard him."
"The lines are open."
"You were gone for a long time."
"Many things have changed."
"It's a thing of the past."
"I will be the chancellor."
"I saw his lightsaber."
"There's your brother."
"You do a good job."
"I'm from the family."
"It's World War."
"The child is mine."
"I'm not going to sing."
"It's happening again."
"Those days are over."
"I will sing with an Italian accent."
"Because she's really smart."
"I went to the police."
"I wanted to see his watch."
"Not that I knew of."
"I should have been here."
"Write whatever you want."
"This is going very well."
"It's the third floor."
"It meant a lot to me."
"People do it."
"That's my family."
"Thanks for the input."
"Those are the orders."
"You're imagining it."
"So, there you have it."
"Something on a pillow."
"And I have the coke."
"I do it too."
"It was because of your mother."
"He's going to be late."
"Very good, good work."
"Yes, I have read it."
"Oh, wait a second."
"The missiles are loaded."
"You have the magic eye."
"I was never here."
"A love letter."
"Oh, and one more thing."
"Let me give you a kiss."
"I have to find it."
"Nobody is that lucky."
"It's a fair question."
"I love cats."
"You have the authorization."
"Call me as soon as you arrive."
"But it's your life."
"Someone made them."
"The question is what."
"He is my right hand."
"Enter the store."
"Here's a towel."
"It's a good gun."
"I'm an open book."
"I will win over the public."
"He wants us to leave."
"I've already seen him."
"You'll have to do better."
"I can assure you."
"Move to the left."
"I don't think I want to."
"You just have to go."
"Next time will be."
"I'll go this way."
"It depends on the question."
"He eats the rest."
"Don't let them see you."
"Yes I remember something good."
"Then I will do it."
"I'll bring it to you now."
"They are worth more than us."
"You'll be safe there."
"We are brave, Your Highness."
"I need you to see this."
"You know we can't."
"When you finish school."
"That's the interesting thing."
"I loved you for a long time."
"Invitation from the house."
"Let me take a look at you."
"Put it in its place."
"I was in the park."
"Please leave that."
"It's the perfect place."
"This is what it's about."
"I love your suit."
"That's an order."
"He is in a dream."
"I've got it now."
"I am a changed man."
"In all aspects."
"What was all that?"
"I've already made a decision."
"What's the rush?"
"Places from our past."
"Don't ever come back again."
"Take out the second quadrant."
"I didn't think he would come."
"It could be many things."
"You have your cell phone turned off."
"It is impossible to know."
"Go get them, tiger."
"And so I did."
"Look at your mother."
"It's what I needed."
"As fast as I can."
"You are the leader."
"I'll send you more money."
"Here is the window."
"Four days have passed."
"It has to mean something."
"Here is the book."
"And you start to like it."
"I love your accent."
"Look at it this way."
"You have one too."
"We entered through the door."
"And the sharks will come."
"I see it right now."
"They are waiting for us upstairs."
"Next to the window."
"I thought it was."
"This will be a lot of fun."
"This will be the last."
"I will see it through to the end."
"I can't afford that."
"It's really me."
"You wouldn't do it."
"Thank you for your contribution."
"And we spring into action."
"Thanks for the loan."
"You have to give me time."
"Everyone stay calm."
"Look, I told you."
"As long as I can remember."
"Deal again, 'Shooter'."
"You said it was okay."
"Two on the stairs."
"I felt lighter."
"You should do it too."
"But not far."
"No way, my friend."
"I see her, I see her."
"At the right moment."
"My snitch lives here."
"Think of our son."
"Today is your birthday."
"Everything is fine, dear."
"I can handle him."
"We must make a decision."
"It has a lot to do with it."
"Dad, don't go."
"They've swallowed it."
"Until the last word."
"Let's go to the left."
"We love having you here."
"It's from the police."
"It's in the report."
"I say the same."
"It better be that way."
"You know what I offer."
"Tell her I love her."
"But it changes everything."
"Recess is over."
"There is a small difference."
"It was a pleasure to see you."
"She's the one."
"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen."
"You and me, both."
"Go to the bridge."
"For four years now."
"I have a court order."
"And I will talk to you."
"It's an air raid."
"I always think about you."
"You never worked in Berlin."
"I was here first."
"I was in church."
"I need you all."
"Okay, my God."
"I want to take you home."
"I was telling the truth."
"Place the snipers."
"I can't do it now."
"Yes, it will be the best."
"House rules."
"I think I passed out."
"Look up at the sky."
"Not one more minute."
"Don't let your guard down."
"You don't need a reason."
"Just for a minute."
"I knew he was right."
"Just for a second."
"It's not your choice."
"It's not very safe."
"Some of us have to work."
"Watch what you do."
"I'm staying with him."
"Let's put an end to this."
"Well, I'll go first."
"Now you're like me."
"Here's your change."
"She is one of them."
"Put a pen like that in."
"I have seen them."
"I have nothing here."
"The suitcases weigh a lot."
"Until you came along."
"We are doing our job."
"It's going to be fantastic."
"Breathe through your mouth."
"Never in life."
"Thank you for the hospitality."
"Welcome to the new world."
"There's the bathroom."
"You're in my place."
"Well, this is nice."
"So you're leaving."
"He must have been clever."
"I'll see you on Tuesday."
"This is the answer."
"They did a great job."
"The Department of Justice."
"It is a beautiful bird."
"It's just that I don't want to."
"Thanks for the rescue."
"Well, if you're sure."
"This explains a lot."
"You're doing it now."
"You're on leave, my friend."
"Just tell us where it is."
"It's time to go back."
"This is very quiet."
"For new friends."
"I'll leave right now."
"Well, thank God."
"My son was only one."
"And I believed him."
"Everything has an explanation."
"These coincidences are incredible."
"Let me see your 'rocket'."
"This is your mother."
"There you have your answer."
"Get off my property."
"I dreamed that there were children."
"It is the usual procedure."
"Women, of course."
"For a new beginning."
"The Brick adores him."
"Touched on the right."
"You guys are the best."
"She is his daughter."
"I said you are beautiful."
"Yes, I had to do it."
"For world peace."
"I was with them."
"I promise you, Dad."
"Two days have passed."
"From the gentleman."
"I did it all."
"He's at the airport."
"Anything will be fine."
"It's a porn movie."
"But they are not smart."
"That's a piece of cake."
"He is unconscious and unarmed."
"Yes, you better."
"Well, what good news."
"We must go home."
"I can't let him in."
"A whiskey on the rocks."
"Yes, that's how it's done."
"That's fine too."
"It was his mother's."
"That clears everything up."
"I'm touching her butt."
"Yes, trust me."
"You are a nobody."
"They have to be there."
"It has never been attempted."
"You'll feel better tomorrow."
"It arrived just in time."
"Was it something I said?"
"Because I have to."
"Or it will be too late."
"Not in my factory."
"Yes, I like it that way."
"Try it one more time."
"Yes, everything is fine."
"My husband is here."
"Listen, it's your time."
"All at the same time."
"It's called extraction."
"That is very common."
"I'm going to call you."
"They have a nice house."
"I like that phrase."
"Just get it over with."
"I meant police."
"I'm your new babysitter."
"I wouldn't do it either."
"There is a multiple thief."
"It's all for me."
"We have to work together."
"He made a long trip."
"I think he doesn't understand."
"That's even better."
"I must go home."
"I hope you enjoy it."
"Yes, and we must talk."
"I love your coat."
"The plane to Lisbon."
"A little whiskey."
"It's a nice car."
"He came and went."
"We have to be patient."
"I think they are fine."
"You are a brave boy."
"I don't think so, my friend."
"I think we should try it."
"It's a big difference."
"Look, it's getting closer."
"But that's me."
"I'm going to pay you."
"He's in a van."
"That's not nice."
"Oh, this is great."
"Before the camera."
"I will do so, sir."
"It was a pleasure, Mr."
"Nobody will care."
"And thanks again."
"The resemblance is uncanny."
"And I to him."
"Still, you had to move."
"That's my offer."
"You better come in."
"I'll talk to my boss."
"We will follow international rules."
"A bottle of rum."
"With your permission, of course."
"I just got here."
"That will do you good."
"You can count on me, sir."
"I am the flower."
"It's a nice change."
"I didn't arrive on time."
"It's a good offer."
"Accept bets on this one."
"Yes, it's very funny."
"I think this is it."
"I wanted to talk to her."
"This office is closed."
"All over the place."
"This is what I'm talking about."
"Pine oil."
"You are the hero."
"I'm going to hang it."
"It was three years ago."
"It was good talking to you."
"It's turning green."
"We have to fix it outside."
"The house is yours."
"It's hot in here."
"Don't be so mean."
"But you are different."
"Do you know what this is?"
"Someone came to see you."
"But it has its merit."
"It's an American issue."
"They know I love them."
"I want to make a wish for you."
"I'm getting warmed up."
"I'm not going in there."
"Now I have to hang up."
"Wait a minute, wait."
"You told him."
"Now I see it clearly."
"I didn't order it."
"No way, man."
"I don't need them anymore."
"I love fish."
"Sit here, please."
"And all those things."
"New category, please."
"We are all here now."
"I promise you that."
"I love the hat."
"I'm going to be nice."
"I'm over it now."
"The ones he always takes."
"Thanks for your advice."
"That happens sometimes."
"Monica is my mommy."
"I'd like to believe that."
"They removed the curtains."
"Those are my orders."
"Suppose we leave."
"It's my masterpiece."
"I'll call you at work."
"They have to do something."
"I think it's close."
"Your dad is right."
"Yes, I will marry you."
"Thanks for the photo."
"The boy is here."
"I'll make you a bet."
"We know each other very well."
"I'm getting on with it."
"The origin of love."
"I have read your books."
"I like this photo."
"She is your friend."
"It's a good life."
"And I feel good."
"I'm just a messenger."
"It could be a coincidence."
"My sister has it."
"You look good today."
"This is your address."
"It was a complete success."
"It's our best option."
"Yes, yes there is."
"Keep the pen."
"I'll meet him."
"It's a serious matter."
"Well, it does for me."
"Well, I have good news."
"It has been a privilege."
"The bill is paid."
"Thanks for the offer."
"This is a raid."
"Go on with your thing."
"I'll be by your side."
"I got one too."
"I've been looking for them."
"But they are my friends."
"Now you are with us."
"I hope he succeeds."
"There are a lot of people today."
"That I do know."
"This is their story."
"We'll leave you a note."
"The beast is different."
"We had the electric chair."
"Of course it does."
"From Russia with love."
"It has been very exciting."
"I like this job."
"Yes, we have done it."
"Half is yours."
"This is the right thing to do."
"I like the hat."
"It should have arrived by now."
"I will be eternally grateful to you."
"Playing bowling."
"More or less the same."
"You didn't tell him that."
"People are watching."
"I think it moved."
"I am that energy."
"We're just going to talk."
"Please, take it easy."
"It's from a friend."
"Well, that's understandable."
"Let me see your phone."
"I think we should go back."
"It's not ready yet."
"The ship is yours."
"Sounds familiar to me."
"I'm just a girl."
"Yes, all day."
"And you mine."
"You look good, babe."
"I live across the hall."
"In body and soul."
"You sound like my father."
"She is my mom."
"Someone must do something."
"You're not thinking clearly."
"That's the name."
"I have the perfect man."
"Just my name, boss."
"I'm going to say it."
"I'll bring you a blanket."
"I want my life back."
"You stay where you are."
"He took her away."
"I think you're beautiful."
"You were always the best."
"I can't handle her."
"Thanks for the company."
"It's my old diary."
"Your phone is ringing."
"We can trust him."
"You'll know very soon."
"This is a cemetery."
"Just him and me."
"Seriously, yes."
"I think he suspects something."
"Get out of the kitchen."
"I hadn't realized."
"It's a legitimate question."
"It's on me."
"I should take a look at it."
"Look at your friend."
"I've always loved them."
"Just get out of there."
"You are the best"
"Well, he's pretty clever."
"I love your shirt."
"It's my property."
"It's in the front."
"We need to talk now."
"I'll see, sir."
"Now I feel good."
"Well, all right then."
"It's a pleasure to see her."
"You're messing with me."
"Yes, I'll call you later."
"Find out what you can."
"I'll answer for him."
"At least until then."
"That's her sister."
"Not all day."
"It's in my backpack."
"But the others do."
"The argument is valid."
"It has everything to do with it."
"Don't call again."
"You're living your life."
"A gold watch."
"I'm going to say something."
"Go back to school."
"Be careful with your eyes."
"My room is fine."
"It's the last day."
"This is first class."
"Yes, that might work."
"Let's go to the room."
"Yes, just now."
"So we have a deal."
"I'm a little surprised."
"Don't go with him."
"Yes, let's see."
"I'm going to look up."
"That's the fun part."
"Nobody knows anybody."
"I think I need to rest."
"I'd like to see you try."
"It's a good rule."
"Yes, you could say so."
"That's my favorite."
"Think of something happy."
"With all my soul."
"Very pretty, very pretty."
"A very lucky hand."
"You have done very well."
"They never found his body."
"That's pretty good."
"That might be okay."
"I like that word."
"I want to know your name."
"All right, everyone out."
"You to me too."
"What I was telling you."
"You're a great girl."
"I have to catch a plane."
"Yes, I will talk to him."
"It could be my father."
"He won't notice."
"A history lesson."
"I love that boy."
"Be careful with the oars."
"It's on the computer."
"It's what we expected."
"I'm going to see it."
"The past is past."
"I'm fed up with you."
"You should go with him."
"You are talking to him."
"She is a girl."
"How good it feels."
"Call me on my cell phone."
"I said it without thinking."
"They know it was you."
"This is your side."
"A gust of wind."
"I'll start from the beginning."
"Good night, my life."
"You go over there."
"All right, here, here."
"I made something for you."
"I wanted him to go away."
"Come hear this."
"I'll go in front."
"Things are changing."
"And I have a son."
"Hello, boys and girls."
"That's easily fixed."
"Please make way."
"Let's see what he says."
"On weekends."
"I'll stay home."
"They don't have to do it."
"I know you like them."
"God creates man."
"Watch your mouth."
"Here's the tea."
"Your wedding gift."
"Yes, this is great."
"Neither you nor I."
"I'm going to report you."
"Here is the second one."
"And all for one."
"It had to be this way."
"You need to get a haircut."
"I gave it to her."
"Same as before."
"It's all right now."
"All right, you win."
"And us too."
"And happy new year."
"Well, you deserved it."
"It's the fifth time."
"Come with us, children."
"Because you never know."
"Please come here."
"They will come to us."
"Let us thank God."
"The Third World War."
"The office is closed."
"Where it is very hot."
"Sir, go with her."
"Honey, we have to go."
"Yes, you have to do it."
"Oh my God, this is amazing."
"That's our secret."
"We will do more than that."
"Once was enough."
"I counted them myself."
"I've thought better of it."
"But that was before."
"That's my style."
"Our honeymoon."
"I've done everything."
"That's something new."
"You can tell the truth."
"I really must go."
"That's the proof."
"Since I was a child."
"Like a little girl."
"Let's go to the other room."
"One in a billion."
"Now we have to go."
"Who would have thought it?"
"I'll send you a box."
"They're going to hear you."
"A van is approaching."
"I stopped by your house."
"You just say it."
"Well, that was good."
"Keep to the right."
"He's a werewolf."
"I gave him an order."
"I'm just being honest."
"I would like to ask a question."
"That's the right thing to do."
"It was what you wanted."
"Many things were said."
"My phone is wet."
"Look what he does."
"I'm sorry about today."
"I'm his best friend."
"Better safe than sorry."
"Just keep calm."
"I knew I knew him."
"I thought the same."
"You said you were hungry."
"It's our only lead."
"It must be worth a fortune."
"So good night."
"It is possible that yes."
"It's like a test."
"About half an hour ago."
"I've thought it over carefully."
"It is of utmost importance."
"Sometimes it is."
"Now and forever."
"It was like a miracle."
"Everyone is very friendly."
"Women are like that."
"He is the father."
"One day they will have secrets."
"I think it was me."
"There has to be someone."
"Fits the profile."
"You have that power."
"It's not him."
"It's not fun anymore."
"That's how boys are."
"I have to go soon."
"Take a little more."
"Thank you very much for helping me."
"I see it well."
"Well, that's better."
"I was on the plane."
"I have them right here."
"It's still my turn."
"It's a nice story."
"The session is closed."
"It's on the right."
"Ask whatever you want."
"Be careful with the water."
"Breaking news."
"I'll see what I can find out."
"Everyone asks about you."
"That makes more sense."
"A glass of wine."
"Talk to your husband."
"They can stay as long as they want."
"My parents are not here."
"Ah, just in time."
"I congratulate you all."
"They're going to catch us."
"Take it as a compliment."
"They haven't said anything."
"Let's see if it's true."
"They are absolutely right."
"Not here, please."
"I have seen the light."
"Until the next sync."
"Supposedly so."
"In any case, thank you."
"Remember your brother."
"It's about to start."
"We have to act now."
"That's all, captain."
"Of course it's unfair."
"Look, I have to hang up."
"Neither you nor anyone else."
"You like it."
"Just ask your question."
"About six months ago."
"I'll take her to rest."
"You don't mean that."
"The temperature is dropping."
"He's coming for you."
"I'm hungry too."
"It is a common name."
"I was already afraid of it."
"He's talking about us."
"I know my man."
"It's a tough game."
"She asked for it."
"Please, Blue Fairy."
"You're better than this."
"The boys are here."
"I do remember it."
"It will be easier that way."
"It's not for you."
"It's just your imagination."
"Probably yes."
"I wonder where it is."
"It's about survival."
"That's the way."
"Yes, I will, sir."
"You saw what he did."
"And she was beautiful."
"But he's gone."
"You saw it too."
"Continue in that direction."
"Stand in the corner."
"And put on your seatbelt."
"It's the first day."
"I figured not."
"I always do it."
"You left the door open."
"I don't remember now."
"That's true, you're right."
"Come on, be a good boy."
"It's in the freezer."
"Maybe I should drive."
"I never liked you."
"Look what time it is."
"You, the new one, too."
"Better out than in."
"Choose the one you want."
"There's my boy."
"I believe in some things."
"Three times a day."
"I went to court."
"I have to be strong."
"Okay, please."
"I understand what you feel."
"Somewhere safe."
"This is my street."
"My wife uses it."
"This is the news."
"Well, I feel better."
"That's the one over there."
"Forever always always."
"I'm not sure anymore."
"The prom."
"They have behaved well."
"It's been ready for a week."
"I've heard about you."
"We will be in touch."
"It has to be today."
"You have all the answers."
"Not the better half."
"The world is like that."
"But now I'm here."
"To see someone."
"You can't be too careful."
"They searched everywhere."
"I'm so sorry, guys."
"You've done it before."
"I'm going for a coffee."
"The ladies are here."
"I want to give you some advice."
"Someone has to be it."
"My God, I knew it."
"Call your witness."
"The soup is ready."
"I would like to speak with you."
"I guess I was right."
"I've already touched on it."
"They look good together."
"I never ask you for anything."
"I feel very well."
"That's the leader."
"Yes, I'm on it."
"As far away as possible."
"All good, all good."
"Make love to you a lot."
"Everything he says."
"One, two, three, up."
"It's going to be wonderful."
"A very kind man."
"That may be so."
"And in what way."
"Closer, please."
"My boyfriend is here."
"The key, please."
"There is money at stake."
"I felt absolutely green."
"I think we're there now."
"Maybe we should go back."
"Tell him how old he is."
"Yes, he is very kind."
"Call me in the morning."
"It didn't really happen."
"It's either them or us."
"Anyway, we're in love."
"I want to make a call."
"It seems like he likes you."
"They are like a union."
"This is the goal."
"Dracula's Castle."
"We call it human nature."
"We just do our job."
"It is something truly extraordinary."
"They always want to sit up front."
"Yes, but carefully."
"You will be late for work."
"The first years."
"I'm sure you would."
"It's for your protection."
"You've made it clear."
"I like it better this way."
"Take this to the lab."
"I thought I would stay."
"He's on the train."
"In three, two, one."
"I feel like dancing."
"She seems like a nice girl."
"Once again, thank you."
"Thank you very much, very kind."
"I tried it once."
"I would say a mermaid."
"You were on the news."
"If I may ask."
"I am a hardworking girl."
"This is a kidnapping."
"Look at this, look at this."
"Who took another route."
"This is my question."
"Stand up, old man."
"I almost believe it."
"It's been a long time since I last saw this."
"A step forward."
"Our servant has it."
"Green, yellow and red."
"It is a wonderful house."
"It's perfect for you."
"That's how things were."
"You can't give me orders."
"Ma'am, calm down, please."
"Glad to meet you."
"From soldier to soldier."
"I live there too."
"He's in the band."
"Hey, block the entrance."
"Okay, I give up."
"Here are your tickets."
"There's the phone."
"Yes, he'll be fine."
"I know my brother."
"And everything will be okay."
"He must be thirsty."
"But first things first."
"You didn't tell him."
"Here's the change."
"That one is moving."
"She makes her own clothes."
"But don't go."
"It all depends on this."
"I am the doctor."
"The system is ready."
"Try not to talk."
"It is the correct answer."
"Thank you for the wine."
"Please, my love."
"I was at the gym."
"There is a lot to learn."
"That's up to him."
"Wherever and whenever."
"I would be very pleased."
"It's all so unreal."
"It is the divine language."
"She has the stones."
"My God, he's right."
"It's just my opinion."
"It's for royalty."
"We did it for years."
"I have to go find him."
"You have us."
"He always finds a way."
"I don't think so, son."
"The talk is over."
"He wants to turn it into rum."
"Now I have it clear."
"Straight to the face."
"My apartment, my belongings."
"I think we're doing well."
"He thinks he's very clever."
"I want that too."
"It was a great success."
"It was that man there."
"You are known to us."
"You already have the files."
"Of course you remember."
"And the other one too."
"A photo, please."
"All right, this way."
"As you say, sir."
"Nice to see you, friend."
"Show me what you did."
"You must be very careful."
"Yes, we have to do it."
"I need you to come here."
"You can do it too."
"It seems that now it is."
"A round of applause for him."
"You and your sister."
"I'll decide that."
"Anyone can see that."
"They are my father's."
"I am your lawyer."
"Be a good mother."
"To protect their territory."
"I want to make you a proposal."
"This is my sister."
"It was just one night."
"I have a date with you."
"I say the same to you."
"That's the attitude."
"Congratulations on the contest."
"I think we will."
"He doesn't know that."
"Tell him to calm down."
"This kid is going to be famous."
"You must give him the stones."
"Get on that side."
"Everyone inside."
"Thanks for the message."
"I don't know what it was."
"Then we won't do it."
"I have the car outside."
"You must be strong, children."
"Now, wait a minute."
"He is my uncle."
"Landing gear secured."
"And with more resources."
"Ah, thank God."
"She is very nice."
"Sure, yes, of course."
"What beautiful flowers."
"I'll be in the office."
"I told you, you see."
"It was a great party."
"My father is a doctor."
"This is the refrigerator."
"I read it once."
"There's a man downstairs."
"Dressed to the nines."
"Go ahead, go have fun."
"This can be serious."
"It's in the spotlight."
"What sons of bitches."
"Not in so many words."
"I've been following her."
"Grandpa is here."
"I just want to live."
"He's heading this way."
"Now, make a wish."
"Thank you very much for this."
"It's on TV."
"Get rid of the bottle."
"Ah, you bring them water."
"I must face my destiny."
"They do a good job."
"I like beer."
"A real kiss."
"Call me at the office."
"Put it in the center."
"He knows what he is."
"Please let me pass."
"Sometimes someone disappears."
"You are a grown man."
"That's what we get paid for."
"Thanks to all of you."
"It has happened before."
"A quarter of a million."
"Life was good."
"He lives in the city."
"Nobody is watching us."
"I knew you'd say it."
"Ah, yes, I see."
"I bet you lunch."
"Your sneakers were broken."
"Cleaning is my job."
"That's what you pay him for."
"It cannot be traced."
"I said I don't know."
"I need something to eat."
"There are many people like that."
"I already have the key."
"I want to finish my work."
"I like it the way it is."
"It's going to pass."
"I ask you kindly."
"School things."
"Tell them what you think."
"I don't know his name."
"Right on the street."
"I'll get him out of here."
"And it's very good."
"The mission is accomplished."
"It looks like her."
"More than half."
"It's a good company."
"Like me, for example."
"At least I'm with you."
"This could be good."
"I have all the snakes."
"I heard you got married."
"Ma'am, stay calm."
"But I like that."
"A little privacy."
"He thinks he is."
"We're going to start now."
"It all makes sense now."
"You wanted to change your life."
"You have every right."
"I'm splitting my sides laughing."
"Not at this speed."
"I'll tell you, ma'am."
"He is a dream."
"One ticket, please."
"There are people who are born."
"I like a lot of music."
"I've already told you."
"Don't you start too."
"Let's say I believe you."
"Not without my children."
"Everything will be okay, darling."
"That is a man."
"Forty-five seconds."
"It's just that it's a lot."
"Well, yes it is."
"Of course we will."
"I go everywhere."
"This is the pantry."
"Look at all these little things."
"Take me to bed."
"It's the same story."
"I care about the girl."
"I'll come back another time."
"You're going to need us."
"I loved her very much."
"It's a nice touch."
"Good, good, very good."
"Mom, it's time."
"Ask your girlfriend."
"I don't want a million."
"It's like a wave."
"I'm that good."
"We're fine, we're fine."
"Madam, please wait."
"That's a coincidence."
"Just like I told you."
"I'm sure he did."
"I work for important people."
"Well, put on your glasses."
"This case is important."
"I don't think so, honey."
"We are in the center."
"Have fun at the dance."
"Just arrived from Paris."
"I'll talk to your father."
"My foot is destroyed."
"Like old times."
"Thanks, I'll tell him."
"I've heard that name."
"Heaven can wait."
"Take it easy, old man."
"Because it's my name."
"Two very pleasant memories."
"Actually, one thing."
"Sometimes I like it."
"And now we are here."
"You can say it again."
"Well, the last question."
"The music room."
"The clock keeps ticking."
"Here it comes again."
"I want to play something."
"There is the proof."
"The music box."
"Bottom left."
"There's the car."
"I love nature."
"Yes, I have an addiction."
"What I was saying."
"This is our land."
"I will be a good wife."
"Well, that's wonderful."
"It's a great discovery."
"I was on the ground."
"That's top secret."
"Sun of my life."
"He was laughing at me."
"Two million pounds."
"What will be, will be."
"Put it in that bucket."
"The mouse is fine."
"That means creating skin."
"The Island awaits you."
"It is a small island."
"It's still the same."
"It is a historic opportunity."
"Put it on the list."
"Well, they're on their way."
"Here are the documents."
"Put it in the bathroom."
"I'm on the team."
"This is the study."
"But we don't know."
"It's a public telephone."
"Drink some more."
"It is standard procedure."
"I was thinking about something else."
"It depends on the woman."
"I say it for you."
"The rest is yours."
"You must get out of here."
"We both knew what would happen."
"They arrive just in time."
"I love her too."
"I'm sure of you."
"One for each one."
"I like the smell."
"It's a quiet night."
"I support this."
"You are my only son."
"Of sheep and horses."
"This deserves a drink."
"At the mall."
"Put an oar underneath."
"Good luck to everyone."
"Go get the book."
"We are behind him."
"I'll go see her tomorrow."
"All over the country."
"It's full of protesters."
"Go back to your family."
"Well, let's take a look."
"Keep repeating the name."
"Music to my ears."
"That's my chair."
"Stay here tonight."
"This land is ours."
"Now he is a man."
"That's right, my love."
"Ah, fuck them."
"Let me see the documents."
"It's full of people."
"As if they were steaks."
"Everything will be okay, Dad."
"Something serious has happened."
"But it can't be done."
"Look, it's really powerful."
"He's working on it."
"Good luck next time."
"And to women."
"I mean her."
"I'll be with you right away."
"Tomorrow is your day."
"I like wine."
"Well, you have to do it."
"I believe you, I believe you."
"Well, once again."
"Oh yes it is."
"There is a nice beach."
"Grow up once and for all."
"Oh, whatever."
"Under my seat."
"We will stay afloat."
"I'm in the guide."
"She is your daughter."
"With all due respect, sir."
"School's out."
"There's your mom."
"The train is full."
"Yes, it is very strange."
"It seems I was right."
"Look at that, look at that."
"I've heard of her."
"I'm ready to play."
"And I to her."
"In four months."
"You have all day."
"I'm opening the door."
"It's very easy for him."
"Don't sit there."
"This is our car."
"You're in my bed."
"Thanks, but I'm fine."
"Watch your sister."
"The boy is smart."
"It was last year."
"Go back to your homes."
"Forty-four strips."
"This is my thing."
"Much better on vacation."
"Well, thanks again."
"It's all up here."
"The case is solved."
"Free my little girl."
"Go with the others."
"How cold it is here."
"I loved the dinner."
"It was four years ago."
"That's my jacket."
"Here's a wing."
"That is our position."
"I was just looking at him."
"He is my boss."
"It's over forever."
"Now let's get out of here."
"Dad, it's a ship."
"I am the princess."
"It's going to be fine."
"Come here, my love."
"I know he has talent."
"But I'll tell you this."
"Good morning, my friend."
"But I have my ethics."
"We have some time."
"Everyone likes them."
"I'm in the army."
"I hope you're smart."
"We talk every day."
"I'll call your father."
"The signal is strong."
"Yes, he is the best."
"It's not finished yet."
"I've never felt that way."
"Open the door, come on."
"The team is united."
"I think he's innocent."
"I have eagle eyesight."
"Well, it's the truth."
"It's okay, everything's okay."
"And it remains that way."
"Welcome home, brother."
"Here is the rice."
"I want to go back to work."
"We loved each other once."
"A job for you."
"It is a first step."
"I was hoping you had time."
"Everything has its time."
"Childhood Memory Generators."
"Let the jury in."
"This place is mine."
"Stay with me, stay with me."
"Focus on the game."
"So we were able to eat something."
"A tram is approaching."
"We're having a great time."
"Now I'll take care of it."
"It was a false lead."
"Something you don't like?"
"There is a lot of noise here."
"I didn't ask your name."
"The sunset."
"I know his wife."
"That's her birthday."
"Yes, we're done."
"Maybe you'll learn something."
"Something is happening to him."
"It seems to be quite practical."
"Good news travels fast."
"The boss is here."
"Here's your coat."
"Everything will be okay now."
"That's why they are great."
"That's my dinner."
"I have a proposal for you."
"He deserves a vacation."
"All right, here it is."
"Come on, take that bone."
"Keep on with your work."
"You know what you did."
"Well, I'll see you tomorrow."
"Hey, that's great."
"Yes, take a minute."
"Of course you're okay."
"The best we can."
"Go to your right."
"Bags of money arrive."
"Now he likes it."
"You need to be very alert."
"He took his own life."
"What have I told you?"
"I have work for you."
"We will take it into account."
"There is the answer."
"We came to the party."
"He already has a family."
"And now, here you are."
"Just for one day."
"Buried under Russian soil."
"I've done my part."
"Allow me a moment, sir."
"You have a wife."
"A very rare diamond."
"And we will do it together."
"I want to be on top of you."
"At my house, tomorrow."
"This ends here."
"I'll tell you the story."
"If you want, I'll take you."
"Let's go to the station."
"That is private property."
"They may never find us."
"Let it be clear to you."
"I'm going with my wife."
"I am the technical advisor."
"He's going to make it."
"Let me do my magic."
"He could be our man."
"It must be coming soon."
"You are the victim."
"Get that out of here."
"I promised him a drink."
"Yes, but I'm fine."
"This is what it's all about."
"For a week now."
"Let me understand one thing."
"It's okay, if you want."
"He knows how to sew, this guy."
"I've never tried it."
"Take care of your sister."
"Keep left up."
"My mom was right."
"May God protect them."
"They call him on the phone."
"I haven't taken anything."
"That is confidential information."
"They should have returned by now."
"He's been talking a lot."
"It is a secret society."
"Come to the table."
"I think I hear something."
"White to play first."
"I'll be at the warehouse."
"Put your camera there."
"We all knew the rules."
"I know what you're saying."
"Wait a second, honey."
"I love the script."
"It has to be them."
"It takes some getting used to."
"I'm going to live here."
"Grab what you can."
"We are the good guys."
"It's right this way."
"I like this part."
"You really should have them."
"It has passed by."
"She is your mother."
"The oars are inside."
"The wind has changed."
"This moment is unique."
"He's in a nursing home."
"I'm sorry, please."
"Take close-up photos."
"A graduation gift."
"Your car is here."
"Just one dollar."
"He is a strong boy."
"A sandwich is safe."
"You said you'd be right back."
"That's asking a lot."
"Yes, I would say so."
"I'll be thinking of you."
"We have to do more."
"Then I met the world."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you very much."
"We are on the boat."
"Not all of them are like that."
"Men, women and children."
"Nor anyone's."
"You know a lot about music."
"That's why they do it."
"We'll take it from here."
"The exhibition is closed."
"The place is wonderful."
"No one I know."
"The house is clean."
"He was an exciting guy."
"I already know the way."
"It's my first choice."
"That's very impressive."
"Life is wonderful."
"I never pulled the trigger."
"Less than a year."
"Stay here with her."
"I thought you'd be happy."
"The system is fine."
"Ready to the left."
"It's not right."
"You see, they were lovers."
"Look, they are my parents."
"Call the paramedics."
"I've seen your programming."
"I'm going to hand you over."
"How is the water?"
"I've seen you dance."
"Play whatever you want."
"Hello both of you."
"They won last night."
"Greetings to your mother."
"Together, you and me."
"And the next one."
"Maybe he doesn't dare."
"I'll go get more."
"You chose the best moment."
"You liked this woman."
"Hey you, come here."
"I have my own plans."
"It can't be yours."
"I was hoping to see you here today."
"I must have her ring."
"It's a wonderful song."
"You sound like your mother."
"He is your friend."
"I will be your best friend."
"You have until Friday."
"It was a smart move."
"It's on the terrace."
"Take me on this journey."
"You are a strong man."
"To other men, yes."
"It was like this when I arrived."
"I knew it would be like this."
"Yes, for a while."
"I have a prior commitment."
"It's a pleasure talking to you."
"That's all then."
"My parents separated."
"I've already finished it."
"I talked to her last night."
"To attract attention."
"Everything's okay, boss."
"That's the challenge."
"The description was correct."
"Nice to hear from you guys."
"I'm at a party."
"My nerves are a wreck."
"Nobody changes with anyone."
"You have to come now."
"That brings back a lot of memories."
"I'll get on with it."
"I like birds."
"Darling, how nice to see you."
"Three, two, one, start."
"I gave them to them."
"I think you will."
"Maybe he wanted to see the world."
"That's what the flight attendant said."
"The world is yours."
"I wanted to see the world."
"We taught him a lesson."
"It was ten years ago."
"This is how I live."
"Please answer if you are there."
"Sometimes I do."
"Your mom left."
"I don't remember inviting you."
"I like the atmosphere."
"Think about your oath."
"I'd be good at it."
"Well, maybe you're right."
"I want you to find him."
"Bring your sister."
"And what is that?"
"I was going to pick it up."
"I don't know how to read."
"That's news."
"I'll pay you, of course."
"It's a generous offer."
"Ready for lightning."
"They are for members only."
"Let's hope it continues like this."
"I don't even eat well."
"And I have them."
"You wanted something better."
"I know where we are now."
"Yes, you already said it."
"Any type of dough."
"I love you, my life."
"As easy as that."
"Three million dollars."
"Everyone put their hand up."
"I'll give it a week."
"I'll buy you an ice cream."
"I'm looking forward to reading it."
"I'm here now, sweetheart."
"The juries have women."
"Your name sounds good."
"I love that dress."
"Not for much longer."
"I have an important announcement."
"Now, he has understood."
"Just what I was looking for."
"You'll have to come back tomorrow."
"They come out at night."
"I like your attitude."
"Don't do anything else."
"I only travel like this."
"That is so beautiful."
"It is an important job."
"Listen to me carefully, all three of you."
"Nobody can do anything."
"You'll be with him soon."
"So go ahead, doll."
"Fleet deployment."
"It's worth investigating."
"I'm looking for my brother."
"Be careful with the ladder."
"It is an old house."
"And you made up a story."
"Call me when you're ready."
"A cooler green."
"It is indeed."
"A dinosaur egg."
"Nobody tells us anything."
"I am a generous man."
"I was with a guy."
"Here it is, for you."
"Let me talk."
"I am the one of the sun."
"I keep him imprisoned here."
"We have to finish this."
"Not to get information."
"I love them too."
"That's a vision."
"He likes my shirt."
"I already did it, sir."
"I wonder what it will be like."
"Helm to the track."
"We have spoken on the phone."
"We have what you see."
"Bring the girl."
"I want her in quarantine."
"The card is great."
"Of course you have it."
"You know what you're doing."
"It's the best place."
"That belongs to the past."
"The system is intact."
"I'll talk to my lawyer."
"It will soon be night."
"This changes things."
"Keep a close eye on the horizon."
"Give me a little more."
"But I had to do it."
"He was the first."
"It's a lovely name."
"For your loyalty, soldier."
"With my own eyes."
"Well, that sounds good."
"See what you did."
"If you know where to go."
"It's better to be prepared."
"Here is the bathroom."
"I have a lot to pay."
"Please sit here."
"And there was something else."
"This man deceived us."
"Here comes the best."
"And you look good."
"I have had so many children."
"Yes, it was about time."
"Seventy-five thousand."
"There goes our boy."
"We tried it once."
"Not if we carry that."
"I love her unconditionally."
"And so it should be."
"I want to tell you the truth."
"Oh, wait a minute."
"At least not yet."
"I'm going to Rome."
"You have to go inside."
"You can't let her go."
"I know you know something."
"Welcome to the brotherhood."
"Mine is new."
"They'll come for me."
"You see the people."
"Yes, we have a lot of work."
"They are very good people."
"The Rebels are there."
"I have read the newspapers."
"Let me see how it is."
"We are making a movie."
"You are the example."
"Without her it will take me longer."
"You are a beautiful girl."
"He was the best."
"I think that's where it is."
"Is that your car?"
"Thanks for doing that."
"Very small, of course."
"I am the future."
"God knows what else."
"It's everywhere here."
"I'll take you to dinner."
"Yes, yes I will."
"Well, that's new."
"It also has good brakes."
"Anything for you."
"Put it on the screen."
"This is our bedroom."
"Sir, you have a call."
"I wish I had the words."
"He is your son."
"It will be a wonderful night."
"The ear is cut off."
"Life is fun."
"Just come here."
"I think it's them."
"It's easy to explain."
"It is a wonderful gift."
"I thought he wasn't coming."
"You must leave right now."
"This ends now."
"A couple of men."
"I think I get it now."
"Come and get her."
"You've heard of them."
"I'm friends with her."
"I've never seen it."
"That's what the Bible says."
"I'm just like you."
"I just saw something."
"Not in my city."
"That is absolutely true."
"As if it didn't exist."
"My statement of principles."
"He's with my mother."
"That's so beautiful."
"That's how things will be."
"I feel so happy."
"It wasn't just that."
"And you will see them grow."
"He was not trustworthy."
"This is a job."
"Open your mouth wide."
"I need a team here."
"Wait a moment, sir."
"I know it was."
"They ask us questions."
"I'll be behind you."
"It's about business."
"He is also your boss."
"Nothing is noticeable."
"That's theft."
"I think he should go."
"Things as they are."
"I think it will be."
"You are brilliant, but terrifying."
"I should be home."
"Yes, I've already taken care of it."
"Here's my girl."
"It would be much easier."
"Now it's your business."
"Until the next meeting."
"I went to the library."
"I'm sorry, really."
"Ten past twelve."
"I think this too."
"I give it a week."
"Many potential customers below."
"Of course you know him."
"Look to your left."
"Every time I come."
"It's been thirty years now."
"I pulled her hair."
"I didn't hear his name."
"The numbers you asked for."
"It's almost five o'clock."
"My room is upstairs."
"I can, I can."
"He seems to be well informed."
"It's a big secret."
"Good night again."
"I left him a chair."
"You know the spies."
"You have to stay small."
"I will always serve Rome."
"Yes, but not anymore."
"I can take care of this."
"It was my brother's."
"I am a grown woman."
"That's very kind of you, thank you."
"It was a pleasure to see her."
"God creates the dinosaur."
"I need your full name."
"Everybody stay still."
"Your baby is fine."
"So now you're a partner."
"Nobody has seen him."
"My son was innocent."
"What day is today?"
"Let it be quick, then."
"I have them too."
"You are wearing a beautiful dress."
"We will take care of your family."
"There is the countess."
"It's a huge place."
"Hey, we need to talk."
"I'll leave whenever I want."
"It's a glorious day."
"These are our boys."
"That of science."
"Well, good night, son."
"I'll take them now."
"Showtime."
"Wait for me at the station."
"Yes, thank you very much, sir."
"Each one of us."
"I'll call him right now."
"I'm in a relationship."
"Juries want honesty."
"Rum is good."
"The numbers are huge."
"We are in a race."
"Of course you do."
"They changed his name."
"Leave that coffee pot there."
"Nothing that interests you."
"Not with this storm."
"It is a public park."
"He has foreseen this."
"The one that is there."
"You are already a woman."
"Rescue team, let's go."
"I have behaved well."
"I said go away."
"Wait here for me a moment."
"The time will come."
"That's his signature."
"I didn't expect him to come."
"Those things did happen."
"I didn't ask him that."
"Come to me, darling."
"My grandmother is sick."
"Out of the chair."
"Give him only soft paper."
"These are things that happen."
"It's not going to be."
"I have a bag."
"Not all night."
"Thank you very much for that."
"Free my men."
"Sorry about your nose."
"You did an excellent job."
"It's a great event."
"That is true."
"I'll be Mr. Purple."
"Well, this is interesting."
"Nobody else does."
"That's my baby."
"You must ask the right thing."
"You have to hear this."
"I think they'll be fine."
"We will look for your brother."
"Where did you get this from?"
"The answer is clear."
"Please let me speak."
"It's much more attractive."
"It's in the guide."
"It's just a facade."
"Based on true events."
"The city needs you."
"I thought you might want this."
"I can win this case."
"Get out of my life."
"We have a team there."
"There are many around here."
"God destroys the dinosaur."
"I will be with you soon."
"You have to be quiet."
"It's for you, sir."
"The time machine."
"Show me the princess."
"Those are more beautiful."
"It seems like a big blow."
"I pay the rent."
"That will be very good."
"Neither here, nor now."
"You're like a brother."
"A month has already passed."
"I'd like to see that."
"You shouldn't have asked that."
"We got the girl."
"Talk to your sister."
"Welcome home, Mom."
"They're going to discover us."
"The Master has arrived."
"You've seen the design."
"Our show is enough."
"I love the dress."
"It's more than fair."
"This time it could be."
"It is a remarkable journey."
"He is doing very well."
"In the old days."
"That's history now."
"I'll bring you a chair."
"That's my story."
"They make a cute couple."
"It's a simple job."
"Of course it has a name."
"I work all day."
"I prefer you."
"Let me see that thing."
"Yeah, that was fun."
"Okay, that's all, guys."
"Someone else was here."
"Polish ones cost more."
"That would be the best."
"I'll make my own luck."
"A lot of courage, I see."
"What a great answer."
"You guys are professionals."
"You're the best, dad."
"Just a few more steps."
"I'll cut something else for you."
"He is the key."
"Earth to earth."
"Nor anything like that."
"I can't ask for more."
"It's for emergencies only."
"But you didn't know that."
"Stay with your father."
"There is still plenty of light."
"You don't look the same."
"It's a deep cut."
"Just like at home."
"Mobile Infantry Division."
"There are good things here."
"I want to talk business."
"Let fate decide."
"I want to have some fun."
"Sleep like a baby."
"I'd bet so."
"You've always had it."
"That's what he felt."
"A young, brilliant talent."
"That was so good."
"So I decided to look for her."
"The judge was female."
"You are the captain."
"Additional nurses for Surgery."
"Tell me something about yourself."
"You can almost hear it."
"This is my answer."
"It's right here next door."
"Remember what we talked about."
"Who is that guy?"
"I'll give you a massage."
"You and me, friend."
"Oh, I believe it."
"You are an attractive woman."
"Thanks for the letters."
"It's the last night."
"We are on the surface."
"I have something for that."
"Give it to the girl."
"Sometimes, not always."
"This girl was kind."
"That if you love him."
"It was a long journey."
"And we will all be rich."
"The millennium is coming, son."
"Station diary."
"Yes, he is my friend."
"They are in bed."
"I'll see you this afternoon."
"You will hear from him."
"You'll see it."
"The kangaroo song."
"Gentlemen, gentlemen, please."
"You are right, my son."
"Ah, yes, here it is."
"Back, back and that's it."
"It's just a cigarette."
"There it comes again."
"I take her home."
"I can call dad."
"I'll stay around here."
"We have to try something."
"I would like to be there."
"Take the night off."
"I have stopped drinking."
"I got married again."
"Actually, it is."
"But now, we must eat."
"This is a gift."
"The time is coming."
"We are having a good time."
"They're for you, sir."
"You are a true hero."
"The leaves have gold."
"We had to say something."
"I need to see your ID."
"Just one more minute."
"I should put you to bed."
"You are a married man."
"They both know it."
"You will see the big screen."
"I didn't think of it that way."
"That's his car."
"I don't think the same."
"The work is done."
"Go to the beach."
"I brought you clean clothes."
"Yes, Mr. Spider-Man."
"The questions are over."
"I'm talking about days."
"That's how things work."
"It seemed like the right thing to do."
"Tomorrow it will be worth much more."
"The bridge is closed."
"That's the truce."
"What is that thing?"
"It's on the beach."
"It's the best way."
"Two and a half minutes."
"I don't know, my love."
"And I like that."
"I truly love you."
"I'll go for the others."
"You have to be alert."
"They put a lot of love into it."
"My father was a policeman."
"All right, here you go."
"I just moved here."
"Now rocks follow us."
"She has a pretty face."
"Trust the system."
"To speed things up."
"Actually, very good."
"At least it's something."
"This is very simple."
"Don't start saying goodbye."
"The keys are in."
"It must be a record."
"For whatever reason."
"It's definitely him."
"This way, my love."
"Look, someone is there."
"We have one for you."
"I was in the library."
"Come, give me a hug."
"I will do it with pleasure."
"There has been an explosion."
"Of course I can hear you."
"I forgot to ask your last name."
"Let me show you around."
"I send you a kiss."
"Yes, it is true."
"My life, please."
"I'm right here with you."
"Nothing more to say."
"You're good at it."
"You have six hours left."
"They are playing my song."
"Yes, you and me."
"It's on its last legs."
"This is hers."
"Back, back I tell you."
"I'm watching it now."
"Okay, let's change the subject."
"Everyone thinks the same."
"All together, please."
"I think you can do it."
"Please make yourselves comfortable."
"The guide was good."
"It's an old custom."
"Yes, I'm going to do it."
"This is my studio."
"On two."
"It's just a number."
"After so long."
"They're going to see you."
"Then don't be."
"I'm leaving forever."
"You've done your job."
"I'm going to go, Mom."
"He disappeared last year."
"But not so soon."
"I think very well."
"He's doing his job."
"A kind of note."
"You are quite a character."
"I loved that car."
"Tell me what you feel."
"I work long hours now."
"Maybe on another ship."
"It's just a spell."
"That was very sweet."
"This is a lieutenant."
"I'll show you how, come on."
"This road is closed."
"No one else could have been."
"Okay, that's enough practice."
"You are an ordinary person."
"I swear before God."
"Well, close your eyes."
"God sees everything."
"I trust my instincts."
"It was five years ago."
"It's fish food."
"I like that part."
"It's like a cathedral."
"He sleeps on the couch."
"I could live here."
"She is the last one."
"Eyes on me."
"I will read your letters to you."
"It's going to be exciting."
"Just give me the address."
"He is your Father."
"We're doing well, calm down, boss."
"They are walking around here."
"They know what it's worth."
"All over the hall."
"I like this very much."
"It's more fun that way."
"You don't even work there."
"Just before Christmas."
"I've seen that before."
"They are at the door."
"This close, man."
"Now let's go find her."
"Yes, sir, full blast."
"They are in the water."
"The rest of us, let's go outside."
"I love that you're here."
"So he's a hero."
"I am a free spirit."
"He is the man."
"That's my secret."
"They are one of us."
"My record is clean."
"I'll leave you here, goodbye."
"I was hoping to see her again."
"You don't like him."
"I'm out of this."
"See my assistant."
"Looks like we have a visitor."
"They are only third class."
"It was Grandma's."
"My brother lives there."
"Then I'll get your number."
"My parents are divorced."
"The rule book."
"You always know everything."
"Not after this."
"There's my friend."
"Now everything will be organization."
"Rome is the light."
"You have come for me."
"We have your son."
"You could fix this."
"I have one more gift."
"Now you know everything."
"Sleeping together is better."
"The air is different."
"Your bachelor party."
"Come on, take a look."
"Around eight o'clock."
"I would rather eat human flesh."
"It means I'm joking."
"Everything is so beautiful."
"Trust your instinct."
"The turkey is perfect."
"It's my book now."
"My brother and I."
"I'm in the basement."
"I want to grow old with her."
"We will give you your judgment."
"Okay, come aboard."
"Well, thanks for this."
"I love red."
"She has a secret admirer."
"It's their only hope."
"The eagle has landed."
"Be careful, you two."
"This needs to be resolved."
"I love grapes."
"That's all, Your Honor."
"Let's discuss this."
"They made you taller."
"They are made in Sweden."
"Beautiful, in her own way."
"It's fine as it is."
"I'm going to Mexico."
"It's our only way out."
"A little compassion."
"But it won't be like that."
"Go back to your cell."
"I haven't had anything to drink."
"Thanks for the show."
"The heart of the ocean."
"Thanks for the jacket."
"Nothing is going to happen to you."
"You must be very happy."
"Look in your sock."
"I teach history and literature."
"It's what we wanted."
"Grab it.. you almost have it."
"Women on the left."
"It's my soft birthday."
"This is the third one."
"Someone changed the label."
"There will be another one for dads."
"My life stopped."
"A declaration of principles."
"In Spanish, please."
"I am an essential worker."
"Your mother's pussy."
"The decision was mine."
"After you, of course."
"I would never have said it."
"That is very convenient."
"I'm not going to pay."
"They want to take over everything."
"I'm going to talk to you."
"It's a little delicate."
"It's my favorite photo."
"That's for you."
"I like keys."
"My God, three bedrooms."
"It's like the others."
"Here is the water."
"End of the line."
"I'm with the police."
"All right, check this out."
"That would be the last thing."
"Thank you for letting us in."
"Take care of my son."
"I like your smile."
"Look at the symbols."
"They are on private property."
"We need the police."
"That's what counts."
"Long before dessert."
"It's a lot for me."
"That's more important."
"Yes, in the center."
"Leave the dollars there."
"And it will be the same with you."
"This is very big."
"Here are some blankets."
"You'll have to do something."
"And more than that."
"You talk to her."
"You have to tell us everything."
"They look very happy."
"The first three notes."
"They shouldn't be here."
"See how it's done."
"This is what we will do."
"I'm a little hungry."
"Have a good life."
"I don't think it's necessary."
"I'll do whatever it takes."
"It's so kind of you."
"A pleasure doing business with you."
"We're out of time."
"You already have what you wanted."
"I have strength in my soul."
"I'll see you in a bit."
"See you in a bit."
"Please leave your message."
"I'll give you whatever you want."
"This is what you will do."
"I'll see you in the morning."
"I'll see you at the office."
"I'll see you in a minute."
"Yeah, I bet."
"All in due time."
"There has to be a way out."
"There has to be another way out."
"You can't trust them."
"I'm going to count to three."
"I'm going to open the door."
"Each to his own."
"Please close the door."
"It's a very long story."
"There was a change of plans."
"I would love to, but I can't."
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen."
"You're on the blacklist."
"I told you to go away."
"Speaking of the king of Rome."
"Don't do that again."
"Don't say that again."
"We're going to take you home."
"I'm going to take you home."
"As if I didn't know."
"You and I are equal."
"There has to be an explanation."
"They can do whatever they want."
"It is beyond our reach."
"Put on your seat belt."
"Another day in paradise."
"I've searched everywhere."
"Please take me home."
"This is how I make a living."
"I didn't mean that."
"I'd rather you didn't."
"There's something I want to show you."
"Not that I care."
"Don't lose sight of it."
"I know what you're feeling."
"Thank you for bringing me home."
"I looked for you everywhere."
"Based on a true story."
"The world is a handkerchief."
"I'll know it when I see it."
"You crossed the line."
"I crossed the line."
"I knew I'd find you here."
"I have to take care of something."
"It's a chessboard."
"I'm a big fan of yours."
"I'll do whatever you ask."
"HER TWIN to keep her together."
"Let me see if I can guess."
"The Dutchman needs a captain."
"I'm fed up with this."
"I can resurrect anyone."
"I feel it on earth."
"He is one of the best."
"I think it's this way."
"I have to do some things."
"Let's see what he can do."
"I'll make it worth your while."
"I smell it in the air."
"Third time's the charm."
"In a couple of hours."
"He is a good boy."
"In a couple of weeks."
"I feel it in the water."
"It's a way of saying."
"Well, if you say so."
"More than anything else."
"I am young and healthy."
"You can be sure of that."
"I do care."
"He's not in his room."
"I think it will be for the best."
"There is a lot of work to do."
"See you at the house."
"All men are equal."
"It's all we have."
"You have to talk to her."
"This time it's serious."
"Not while we have any strength left."
"What remains of it."
"She is a good girl."
"We have done everything possible."
"We will do the best we can."
"More than you imagine."
"Do what I told you."
"It had better be."
"It had better be so."
"I was expecting you last week."
"Well, thank you for your time."
"We must wait for night."
"I've already explained it to you."
"I'm going to call security."
"Nobody goes anywhere."
"Don't give it another thought."
"Yes, whatever you say."
"I ask you please."
"I'm going to talk to them."
"I can't say anything else."
"It's what I always wanted."
"It's the best there is."
"We're all in this together."
"I certainly don't."
"I'll go count the votes."
"I must ask you to leave."
"Everything is going to be okay."
"Not as well as you."
"You don't know anything about that."
"We must call the police."
"Here we belong, fighting to survive."
"You are very far from home."
"I haven't told him anything."
"You and I are friends."
"Tomorrow will be a great day."
"I won't allow that to happen."
"I can't go any faster."
"You're doing it again."
"I hope I don't have to."
"I looked for him everywhere."
"It's in the other room."
"I came to see how you were."
"I'm going to go see."
"I'll see you in a moment."
"That's not up to you to decide."
"None of that matters now."
"Do the best you can."
"That's what you need."
"It's here somewhere."
"See you in the car."
"I've been everywhere."
"I've just got home."
"I'm sorry about your brother."
"Thank God you came."
"He has gone home."
"I'm sorry about your friend."
"Winner takes all."
"I know there's someone there."
"Time to go home."
"Today is a historic day."
"Permission to board."
"And I'm going to do it."
"I've never been so happy."
"I'll see you at dinner."
"This is what it does."
"I'm going to end this."
"In the back seat."
"How glad I am to see you."
"You are a box of surprises."
"Along with all his possessions."
"She would say she knows enough."
"That's never going to happen."
"I know what this is."
"You are here because you know something."
"I would like to talk to her."
"I can't compete with that."
"Here's a nice thing."
"That's new to me."
"This is a free country."
"Today is a special day."
"Love, love, how I adore you."
"As hard as you can."
"Because you've been there."
"That's not what I heard."
"I have to talk to you about something."
"Girls like it."
"I'll see you at school."
"There's something I want to ask you."
"I didn't expect you to do it."
"Thank you so much for doing this."
"It's happened to all of us."
"You've already said that."
"Let the girl go."
"Whatever you say, sir."
"Because I believe in something."
"That's what happens."
"I'll say it one more time."
"These are the winds of change."
"It's like riding a bicycle."
"I tell you this as a friend."
"Time heals everything."
"Practice makes perfect."
"He wants to be found."
"I know they're out there."
"I'm sorry I got you into this."
"And they call it a mine."
"I've heard about that."
"It was you on my computer."
"I was here a minute ago."
"You have cut your hair."
"It's all you have."
"I'm going to come see you."
"Look what I've done."
"You look good too."
"The pill is for tracking."
"I'm at a public telephone."
"The answers are on the way."
"He can show you the way."
"I don't think you know."
"Well, that's life."
"Maybe the taste is off."
"I'm going there right now."
"I just received your message."
"See it with your own eyes."
"You can stay at my house."
"Work is work."
"Because you've never used them."
"We have to catch up."
"Alert all commands."
"It was all I had."
"I told her I loved her."
"I had forgotten about him."
"I've heard it too."
"Only life is important."
"I guess that's all."
"She is my best friend."
"Well, thanks anyway."
"Have some wine."
"I'd like to think so."
"But you humans don't."
"The door on your left."
"No one has done anything like this."
"They are on the eighth floor."
"You know it better than anyone."
"One, two, three, and four."
"Come and give me a kiss."
"Okay, I'll tell him."
"I can't think of any."
"I like what I do."
"This is what he wants."
"This is what you want."
"There is a lot to talk about."
"That's the easy part."
"In the background on the left."
"I want them out of here."
"I haven't spoken to him."
"All right, let's get out of here."
"The woman in the red dress."
"Not if we remain faithful."
"I have to get home."
"This is the main deck."
"The door on the left."
"You know what I think."
"The measure of civilization."
"My house is your house."
"You know, being someone important."
"Men are what we are."
"One is by the stairs."
"This will make you feel better."
"But they don't know it."
"Stay here just a moment."
"This means a lot to me."
"The police were waiting for us."
"Better that you don't know."
"It is good for your health."
"Let's see if you like it."
"Now it's all up to you."
"Our great war is spiritual."
"I know exactly how it feels."
"This will only take a second."
"Put it somewhere hidden."
"It's one of those things."
"I see it day after day."
"This is going to be okay."
"Look what he's done."
"We have to go right now."
"Well, that's the question."
"To their battle stations."
"Drums drums in the deep."
"The peak of their civilization."
"Now the ring is yours."
"They've taken everything."
"Please don't talk like that."
"I don't know anything about anything."
"It's not what I wanted."
"That's not what I said."
"We need to talk privately."
"One of you has to do it."
"There is a change of plans."
"The rest of my life."
"And you are absolutely right."
"I can't live without him."
"Your secret is safe."
"I was separated from my family."
"These are the other Potentials."
"We continue fighting, we hold the position."
"And all thanks to you."
"Have a little respect."
"Okay, keep your secrets to yourself."
"It's all I wanted."
"That was two days ago."
"It is a very beautiful place."
"You can be of more use."
"That man on the corner."
"I'll see you at church."
"That's great news."
"This is a safe place."
"It's nailed to the floor."
"I thought you were a man."
"I told them not to come."
"Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine."
"Eat all you want."
"You have to go to work."
"I'll lend it to you whenever you want."
"All babies want to be born."
"You know, the usual."
"Let everyone come out."
"I think you do know."
"That's what you said last time."
"Well, good luck with that."
"Trying to conquer the world."
"They will be the Fellowship of the Ring."
"Call me as soon as you hear this."
"Do whatever you want with me."
"The easiest thing in the world."
"Listen to what you are saying."
"I'm always glad to see you."
"Take a step forward."
"I would like to see her again."
"You are very good at this."
"The circle of life."
"It's time for my injection."
"Trees are strong, my lord."
"There isn't much to see."
"Scanning all systems."
"Yes, maybe you're right."
"This is what you wanted."
"Now would be a good time."
"He knows how to get home."
"You must trust yourself."
"I'll take first watch."
"You have an important day tomorrow."
"Questions that need to be answered."
"I've been set up."
"I can be your family."
"Give me a hand with this."
"I have the strength of the soul."
"You will do what I say."
"Give me some of that."
"It is a defense mechanism."
"I just want to talk to her."
"They have to be around here."
"They won't go anywhere."
"Today is my first day."
"I think we're safe."
"You must ask the right question."
"Thank you for your time, sir."
"A couple more days."
"Good morning to you too."
"Please get me out of here."
"This is how we will do it."
"I hope you feel better."
"Tomorrow at the same time."
"It's as much mine as it is yours."
"I'm going to go get him."
"This is all for you."
"There's a reason for that."
"Yes, I'm going to be fine."
"Go and talk to him."
"Me too, my dear boy."
"I'm going to prepare dinner."
"Or at least half."
"It is the safest place."
"This is a special occasion."
"I told you this would happen."
"There and back."
"It's here, in my pocket."
"Friday night."
"You and I know it."
"You have created a new item."
"I repent of my sins."
"Do what you need to do."
"I have a task for you."
"Well, we have to do something."
"I'm asking you a question."
"Look who we have here."
"But do what you want."
"Wow, look who's here."
"We met last year."
"That's a good name."
"This must be the place."
"Then we'll see each other again."
"Thanks for yesterday."
"Because we will be together."
"I have never said that."
"And now, the main attraction."
"Return to your homes now."
"I see her every day."
"They think we know nothing."
"It surprised me too."
"I think I can rescue him."
"It is a pleasure for me."
"That's in the past."
"All systems are go."
"I told you it was good."
"I'm sure it's okay."
"The Ark of the Covenant."
"Back and to the left."
"I have to go with them."
"Attention all units."
"This is just a dream."
"You all have the combination."
"And these are my friends."
"Someone had to do something."
"It's your birthday present."
"We have to go find him."
"I've looked everywhere."
"You have to go through it."
"It's the last thing I need."
"Yes, I know your son."
"I have to tell you a secret."
"This is what I wanted."
"I want to see them in my office."
"And your son will pay with you."
"It's been a good day."
"Dreams come true."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury."
"That's his real name."
"And that's a fact."
"Yes, that's what it's all about."
"Sometimes I wonder."
"It must be somewhere."
"Remember, focus on the moment."
"You'll have to come with us."
"It's past ten."
"You're going to feel better."
"There's plenty of time for that."
"Your words, not mine."
"But they haven't."
"Say you'll marry me."
"I'm glad I'm back."
"I'm in a very good mood."
"I'm going to make breakfast."
"His vital signs are fine."
"Sorry about before."
"I know so little about you."
"I'm going to school."
"I have to do one thing."
"He has some kind of bruise."
"You can't trust her."
"I'm sorry about your son."
"You have to tell the truth."
"I have to live with that."
"This is a wonderful day."
"That's what we must do."
"I think you know why."
"The question is why."
"I left it at the office."
"It is a very elegant neighborhood."
"We are having a great time."
"They don't do things at random."
"Yes, I've heard that."
"In the name of Jesus."
"I will take back what is ours."
"It's what you think."
"Yes, a couple of times."
"I had to talk to someone."
"I want to see mountains again."
"And we are the cure."
"It's in the safe."
"This is going to be easy."
"I don't know, you tell me."
"Well, let's finish this."
"Don't let them send transmissions."
"We're going to get through this."
"You keep the money."
"I'll see you in a few minutes."
"I'll tell you the whole story."
"Look who went to talk."
"Get under the bed."
"I think I've found it."
"At least for the moment."
"It is exactly what it is."
"Meet my wife."
"All the time in the world."
"You can be faster."
"Well, it was a pleasure meeting you."
"Come, sit next to me."
"Good night to both of you."
"I know what it means."
"Look inside your heart."
"The party has just begun."
"I ask you as a friend."
"Please come with us."
"Aim at the target when it appears."
"It was made by the Elves."
"That was three days ago."
"I have to go back in."
"Yeah, good luck with that."
"The guy is a genius."
"I've seen it many times."
"Look what you're doing."
"It's a work in progress."
"This is what I will do."
"We have come a long way."
"Let's take a little rest."
"It's already passed me by."
"It depends on the point of view."
"I will do so with pleasure."
"There are investigators on the scene."
"I'll tell you what you'll do."
"You need a haircut."
"I'm going to go now."
"I've heard of them."
"From her to eternity."
"You're all I have."
"You have everything you need."
"It's for your own safety."
"I have a delivery for you."
"I think I already did it."
"Good luck with your book."
"Let's see if we understand each other."
"I'm sorry about this morning."
"You will be late for school."
"It's all I had."
"At eight o'clock sharp."
"I have something I want to show you."
"Thank goodness you're here."
"I haven't asked him that."
"They search for treasures in the mountains."
"I know it's late."
"A job is a job."
"We have something important to discuss."
"It's going to do you good."
"Well, that's up to you."
"I like your hair like this."
"There's something in this house."
"He's on his honeymoon."
"See you tomorrow night."
"Let my people go."
"Everything went back to normal."
"That's the headquarters."
"It's totally different between us."
"I haven't asked him."
"I am with you in your feelings."
"I don't think I know him."
"The kitchen is this way."
"We have you."
"I've told him everything."
"You can't hide from me."
"I would like you to do it."
"I could use a coffee."
"Like the movie star."
"I'll keep your license."
"Hello, nice to see you."
"It's a matter of a second."
"It's just what we need."
"He was a very brave man."
"I bet you don't dare."
"There is a message for you."
"You need to be more specific."
"It's a boxing match."
"Like watching it on TV."
"It's part of history."
"It's not tomorrow, it's today."
"Your daughter trusts you."
"That's what will happen."
"It's a way of speaking."
"Hey, thanks for the beer."
"Please come this way."
"I told you once."
"I'm glad I did."
"I think they already know each other."
"This is what I said."
"That was a year ago."
"But it's not going to work."
"With a little luck."
"Please don't touch that."
"Come as soon as you can."
"I just wanted to check on you."
"I hope I did the right thing."
"I'm going man-hunting."
"I have given you an order."
"I don't think it's working."
"The land of opportunity."
"As clear as water."
"It's old school."
"Please leave right now."
"You got us into this."
"You are very kind, sir."
"I'll ask him again."
"Sleep well, my son."
"I told you I'd find you."
"It seems that this is where we say goodbye."
"Let him say what he wants."
"You don't know anything about anything."
"You are bigger than me."
"The lucky seven."
"That's what this is all about."
"And you're coming with us."
"Like a Christmas tree."
"I have some questions to ask you."
"Give me a couple of minutes."
"He is a good guy."
"And they lived happily ever after."
"Do what I ask of you."
"One thing, and simple."
"One more time, please."
"I have a son too."
"How thoughtful of you."
"And they use us like cattle."
"At his father's house."
"Nobody knows he's here."
"It depends on what it is."
"You have to bring me your torch."
"All aboard, please."
"I guess these things happen."
"You are just like your mother."
"Drink some of this."
"Put this on your head."
"But it is what it is."
"She is right."
"It is important that you find it."
"I am bigger than you."
"I can hear it in your voice."
"That's a wonderful choice."
"What do you do?"
"Let me explain it to you."
"You know what happens."
"It seems to be going well for him."
"I have to go out for a moment."
"I must become something more."
"I must become something else."
"The best for the best."
"Yes, that's the point."
"Please sit down for a moment."
"Thanks for remembering my coat."
"I have other plans for you."
"You say you can't sleep."
"I thought you didn't like it."
"Now go to bed."
"He is a very handsome boy."
"A man of few words."
"I was here the whole time."
"They are leaving Middle Earth."
"We live in the same building."
"We've already taken care of that."
"In case we want to change nights."
"It's bulletproof."
"I'm going to tell you the truth."
"She gave you a son."
"We have to talk to him."
"That goes for you too."
"What you did was great."
"Thank you all for this."
"We must do something about it."
"I want to go back to the blue room."
"You shouldn't say those things."
"That was a month ago."
"Because it presents you with other opportunities."
"That's all he said."
"It's a big rabbit, relax."
"I'll put it on the roof."
"For one of the greats."
"We are going to sell the house."
"There's something you need to know."
"Just who I wanted to see."
"Both options were possible."
"I share your feelings."
"And a glass of water."
"I can still do my job."
"I'd never thought about that."
"In the world before."
"I knew he was coming."
"The first one on the right."
"I would like to remember more about him."
"I told you he'd stay."
"Tell him I'm coming over."
"We're going to take the boat."
"On their honeymoon."
"It was very important to him."
"You've always been fair to me."
"They say it was an accident."
"It's lunchtime."
"I don't know when or where."
"Nobody knows for sure."
"You know how things are."
"We will take you home."
"You're a lucky boy."
"I went to all the classes."
"The power has gone out."
"It's true what they say."
"I'll be gone for a while."
"We have to put an end to this."
"But thanks anyway."
"They have done a good job."
"Can't talk to you."
"I've had enough of this."
"It's all there is."
"I hope it's not true."
"That was out of place."
"Well, this is a surprise."
"Our first catch of the day."
"I know the same thing as you."
"That was a week ago."
"It's my birthright."
"A good cup of tea."
"There has to be a way."
"It's about to arrive."
"He will get you what you need."
"I wonder about that too."
"You stay until it's over."
"Great contribution to humanity."
"You are not safe here."
"Two guys come to see them."
"That they are not trustworthy."
"It's a gypsy camp."
"That's why you have to move."
"You and I can fix it."
"Nobody wins every case."
"Someday we will work for him."
"Not like in yours."
"I can't talk about this."
"Do what I do."
"No one can be trusted."
"They say he's a good boxer."
"It's what he deserves."
"We'll do it next time."
"You are not a nobody."
"I'll be at the underpass."
"You already know more than me."
"I'm giving you a chance."
"They would have let you go because you were an idiot."
"I have double the income."
"I will do what I must do."
"Well, I hope you're right."
"Now I don't know what to do."
"Don't do this, please."
"I'm so in love with you."
"Yes, we were in the army."
"I think I know where it is."
"Money gives you power."
"It's been a great day."
"It will be the last thing you say."
"I don't do this."
"Let him know who's in charge here."
"I thought I had done it."
"Attention to all staff."
"There's something in the water."
"He's been asking about you."
"Everything is half price."
"People say many things."
"I will learn about the business from him."
"Tell me when you've done it."
"Get a job or something."
"I saw you practicing this."
"I already did it once."
"Glad to see you here."
"I can't survive without you."
"I had a very busy day."
"It has to look like an accident."
"I think it's the right thing to do."
"Without the water guns."
"Leave your friend here."
"We met the other day."
"We'll take the long way around."
"Listen to this one and learn."
"You have something on your face."
"I have to go with him."
"I think they're gone."
"Like with astronaut monkeys."
"It's been a wonderful night."
"I thought he was gone."
"I can't, I have a commitment."
"You are a genius, sir."
"You spent a summer in one."
"I think you speak from the heart."
"I have to answer to the shareholders."
"The briefcase was mine."
"We have a schedule to keep."
"I thought it was the main one."
"The dog will return to camp."
"You're running out of time."
"You seriously look beautiful."
"But we must wait until dawn."
"That's magic chess."
"From my vault in Spain."
"All these guys adore you."
"Since I was very little."
"Every action has its reaction."
"He had it tied to his arm."
"And this house is ours."
"I told you not to go out."
"For a handful of grapes."
"I've seen them too."
"I feel it's the right thing to do."
"This is bulletproof."
"I stopped seeing you when you were little."
"Much ado about nothing."
"He's like family."
"It could be my son, anyone."
"They were very clear about it."
"I already know what I'll do."
"I'm very good at this."
"But this is a democracy."
"Each one has his district."
"Here you have top-notch merchandise."
"They did that every day."
"I'll do it for a caravan."
"It just keeps getting better."
"You have to take it easy."
"It's all in your mind."
"I'm telling you to go."
"I say this because it's true."
"The waterfall is very important."
"I'm giving you an order."
"They are getting closer and closer."
"That will be if you don't come in."
"They put him in with the gold."
"I've seen all of his movies."
"And he's a good boy."
"There are a lot of dishes to wash."
"The humans took him away."
"They are doing a good job."
"It can be done later, of course."
"I've been in your place."
"Thanks for the drink, dog."
"That's the hardest part."
"It's street justice."
"At seven o'clock sharp."
"He's going to like that."
"A deal must be made."
"I didn't know, I swear."
"Sir, a transmission from the planet."
"Let's not talk about my wife."
"Receiving a message from home."
"I am half and half."
"Yes, that is very nice."
"There's something different about you."
"He looks like he's going to throw up."
"A commission must be appointed."
"This is going to be amazing."
"It is a very nice house."
"There are pockets on both sides."
"I have to change my clothes."
"Please state your name."
"All right, once again."
"Tell them not to come closer."
"Please tell me the truth."
"One side sharp, one side not."
"Let this serve as a lesson to you."
"I'm doing what I can."
"There is something you can do."
"A slight change of plans."
"God is on our side."
"But she is already a woman."
"I'm going to take it away from you."
"I come before you in peace."
"It's your birthday party."
"It's just what I wanted."
"Everything got out of control."
"He is curious about the planet."
"That was homemade."
"That choice belongs to her."
"I think it's a plane."
"I don't think he's interested."
"There has to be a connection."
"We have behaved very well."
"I guess you already know."
"Not the red one, the pink one."
"These are my friends, Mom."
"We are going to the movies."
"Fine, do what you want."
"Nice to see you, man."
"You know how this works."
"Finish the race, of course."
"Let them think what they want."
"You are the boy who survived."
"I think it would be cheaper."
"He protects you like a father."
"Don't leave without me."
"All circuits are busy."
"The heart of the ancient kingdom."
"Family is everything."
"There you will find what you need."
"It's about being efficient."
"I'm very good at that."
"You have been a great comrade."
"What I've always wanted."
"In the name of Allah."
"It's what she wanted."
"Good to see you again."
"I want some action."
"Not in the prohibited section."
"Notice to all units."
"I want to see them against the car."
"Don't be smart."
"I had to go to the bathroom."
"Don't talk about my father."
"Now go back to bed."
"I'll give you what you want."
"With your permission, my master."
"You're going to like it a lot."
"Everyone loved her."
"I told you it was for no one."
"Not a minute later."
"I am a product of your imagination."
"I think I'm going to go."
"Stay here, where it's safe."
"And this kid has something."
"Meet my friends."
"In the background, on the right."
"I have something in my eyes."
"You're very good at that."
"Throw that in the glove compartment."
"Well, that's what it's all about."
"I told you I'm fine."
"Sorry, we have to go."
"Especially for a woman."
"Today I am going to educate you."
"Now you can make your dreams come true."
"Put some ice on it."
"They are about to arrive."
"There's something I must tell you."
"When you step back, you find things."
"I've always wondered."
"Just a couple of minutes."
"See you at the entrance."
"And I know it very well."
"One more minute, please."
"Thank you for your interest, Chancellor."
"I've already seen this one."
"War is being prepared."
"Today, we are going to make soap."
"Give me a kiss goodbye."
"Just like last time."
"And yet, here you are."
"It's part of its charm."
"They should make pills for this."
"It's been a long journey."
"Let me talk to my daughter."
"I am a family man."
"My son's life."
"You have something in your teeth."
"You've done your best."
"That's another thing."
"In two or three days."
"I want this to be over now."
"Today was a good day."
"I am a servant of God."
"It is necessary, for our protection."
"I need you to talk to him."
"Whatever you say, boss."
"I'll see you at the station."
"Location is the combination."
"Have a glass of water."
"I'll never do it again."
"His son offered us refuge."
"I realize this."
"I have a lot to think about."
"You are a very lucky man."
"Until the end of the world."
"I haven't seen her lately."
"I will present our case to the Senate."
"I try to make a living."
"Put everything on the counter."
"Please leave here."
"I have brought some leaders."
"Since I was a baby."
"I know it's around here."
"It's about to dawn."
"You know I'm a good shooter."
"It is the way to heaven."
"Because I'm starving."
"We looked for you everywhere."
"I'm painting and stuff like that."
"But he's like a brother."
"Dad is going to be okay."
"This happens all the time."
"See you in the future."
"Welcome to your new home."
"I take the money out first."
"That was last week."
"But now I have to go."
"A year is a long time."
"The man is a genius."
"This place has everything."
"It means a lot coming from you."
"Keep a closer eye on your pets."
"Talk to everyone."
"The night is still young."
"I haven't finished speaking."
"Just over a year."
"I have many things to tell you."
"And all because of you."
"That was many years ago."
"I don't think about that anymore."
"Please, I need the job."
"We have a couple of questions."
"It was a war detachment."
"We meet at the door."
"I searched for her for two weeks."
"It's about my life."
"You've taken your time."
"It's a long way from home."
"Father, Son and Holy Spirit."
"Now I don't know what to say."
"Think about what you do."
"You are a narcotics agent."
"It's all they had."
"Let them say what they want."
"I think you may be right."
"I'll repeat it to you."
"If it makes you feel better."
"Well, thanks for your time."
"It could be any of them."
"Someday I'll explain it to you."
"Thanks for not saying anything."
"I'm going back home."
"Breakfast of champions."
"It's a great pleasure to meet you."
"Let's get some fresh air."
"The sirens are already close."
"Very thoughtful of you."
"Those are not my children."
"There has to be a reason."
"I assure you it will be."
"Now that's life."
"To the back."
"You will meet them again."
"It's where the track ends."
"It's the Moscow train."
"I have a daughter too."
"It's more of a proposal."
"I think I've been clear."
"It's just what I need."
"There was a girl in Paris."
"I am on an important mission."
"I forgot we weren't going to ask questions."
"I came as soon as I found out."
"I have to go downtown."
"Time to go to work."
"He honors us with his presence."
"You have a call waiting."
"I have something special for you."
"I only have what I see."
"That's what you can prove."
"We have to go after him."
"You were identical to him."
"Okay, I promise."
"Today is a good day."
"That's what you have."
"It's the same every year."
"At two o'clock sharp."
"I can think of something better."
"I'm just here for Paris."
"The Statue of Liberty."
"I thought you had forgotten."
"I want surveillance on the street."
"Wait a second, please."
"It is a very generous offer."
"I have to catch a flight."
"I'm very proud of him."
"Day or night."
"But it's going to cost you."
"We just want you to be happy."
"See you in a few minutes."
"Alert all units."
"You have to see one thing."
"Wait, it's in the box."
"I don't think I can go."
"Eyes on the prize."
"Tell me what I want to hear."
"Nice to see you, brother."
"And we're leaving here."
"You've arrived just in time."
"There is a chain of command."
"I have to make a phone call."
"We have to go back in."
"See you in a month."
"My first job, in Berlin."
"I'll see you at work."
"I love happy endings."
"Let them watch the south side."
"And I demand my human rights."
"I think it looks good."
"I don't like tea."
"I know you have secrets."
"He's done it again."
"And there is their castle."
"A jug of black, boss."
"Stay with me and you can get there."
"Nothing worthwhile."
"The deal is still on."
"I guess it was fate."
"But I have to talk to you."
"Give me a couple of hours."
"I don't think you did."
"As if it had never existed."
"I guess I owe you one."
"We did the best we could."
"I'll take care of this one."
"I have to go with her."
"You look just like your mother."
"I have a test for you."
"Then you can change things."
"You look beautiful tonight."
"Nice to see you, sir."
"I guess we'll have to wait."
"There will be time for that."
"It's at the end of the hall."
"With the police department."
"I just say what I see."
"They turn their backs on him."
"Bring me a glass of water."
"It's not good enough."
"There's always something to do."
"You can keep the money."
"And you will be my successor."
"I don't expect you to understand."
"Top of the class."
"Several police officers say yes."
"We find ourselves in the dark."
"I admire what you are doing."
"It's the end of the road."
"Now, go back to your bedrooms."
"And I'll tell you one thing."
"And look what he did."
"I won't say another word."
"The heads on the wall."
"Sometimes good things happen."
"A family friend."
"There's something in his throat."
"I hope you don't."
"And he'll be back tomorrow for lunch."
"To the colony of survivors."
"There's something you don't know."
"Last night was wonderful."
"I'll leave in the morning."
"Please turn around."
"People like it."
"We'll do it my way."
"I never thought I would do it."
"Well, we can't allow that."
"Man versus nature."
"We, the people, know it."
"At four o'clock sharp."
"I'll tell you myself."
"You'll answer for that."
"I'm going to start over."
"We'll see what can be done."
"I was waiting for you to say that."
"I think he's had enough."
"Hopefully the Senate will support us."
"Because I have faith in my heart."
"It is an ongoing investigation."
"It's exactly what I want."
"I think it was himself."
"I'll see you in court."
"See you in a second."
"You have to come home."
"Our survival will be your legacy."
"We have to ask you some questions."
"And that's the important thing."
"But it's also your home."
"At the gym, whenever you want."
"I hope you are very happy."
"Now you know how it feels."
"I'll go see what's going on."
"This may take a while."
"Here is the human brain."
"You're doing very well too."
"I thought you had left him."
"Next on the left."
"This is your big chance."
"I have to make dinner."
"Say what you mean."
"She will take you to therapy."
"A knight of the night."
"I will write to you every day."
"We have to start over."
"You have to end this."
"I've taken care of everything."
"Funny you should say that."
"I think we have a deal."
"We have so much to talk about."
"Now you are one of us."
"The clock is the key."
"Please tell me what to do."
"You are a lucky girl."
"I think it's that way."
"And something is happening here."
"I have to do the right thing."
"Let me see what you got."
"It's a pleasure to have you here."
"But you haven't."
"I will be late for school."
"I'll see you in my dreams."
"For a little money."
"I'd better not tell you."
"I want you to be comfortable."
"I want to see what's underneath."
"I assure you it was them."
"This place is a labyrinth."
"This is about my brother."
"Let's see who gets there first."
"It better be something good."
"So special and then boom."
"That was my best time."
"Thanks again for coming."
"You already know the spies."
"You can take it off now."
"I know what I'm telling you."
"We're forgetting something."
"Leave it and put it back where it was."
"And all because of me."
"I love you too, daddy."
"That's what you want to hear."
"I can get them out of the city."
"It was the best thing for him."
"Then come to bed."
"I have to go right now."
"In the name of science."
"But it will be the last time."
"Nobody told you."
"I don't think you want to know."
"Tonight at eight."
"You're a man now."
"Get into a position of surprise."
"I'm going to pull you."
"That will be decided by the court."
"The target is on the move."
"It's time to let go."
"As if that were possible."
"This looks great."
"Then don't tell him."
"Someone is playing with us."
"I've never had a birthday."
"All right, I'll tell him."
"You are identical to your father."
"I thought we were going out."
"It's half past three."
"You did a good job today."
"I'll arrive tomorrow night."
"I've always wanted to go there."
"I'm in a good mood today."
"My body is a temple."
"The Water of Life."
"I couldn't tell you exactly."
"They are calling from Earth."
"To protect my son."
"Have a great day."
"Nice, you brought the wine."
"It's just a matter of when."
"The greatest of all."
"Everyone laughs at me."
"There's something I want to tell you."
"It's a gift for you."
"One was a pregnant woman."
"Excellent, good teamwork."
"But he hasn't."
"Table for two, please."
"You look like my mother."
"You're going to have to do it."
"You are unique in the world."
"Don't just sit there."
"And I'll be waiting for you."
"I'm going to give you some advice."
"It's like he's disappeared."
"Nobody likes you."
"It is good for the skin."
"The character based on you."
"Someone I can trust."
"Just a couple of months."
"I have never seen him."
"And he meant it."
"We have to think of something."
"There's something you should see."
"A nice surprise awaits you."
"You can't imagine it."
"I'm looking for the girl."
"I know something has happened."
"You have to go after him."
"And he did it very well."
"Life is a blessing."
"This is what it is."
"You know who I mean."
"Well, I'm happy for you."
"See you at the tournament."
"I can come back another time."
"Everything will be solved."
"So now you know."
"I'm going to tear you to pieces."
"You're doing it right now."
"I have some questions too."
"At my sister's house."
"Send it to headquarters."
"Give him some space."
"It's an old Indian game."
"I'm going to call the doctor."
"I swear I'm clean."
"I'm a real boy."
"It's not exactly the same."
"The exit is that way."
"They say you are a king."
"Space, time, life itself."
"I think we have to go."
"Across the hall."
"You better watch out."
"They are sons of bitches."
"But I'm going to do it."
"It's a welcome gift."
"You have to come see me."
"Prepare to cut the power."
"This is a matter for the government."
"But you are a seeker."
"It's a very important call."
"Feel better, champ."
"Thanks for before."
"You are doing an excellent job."
"I have read about them."
"Now I know how it feels."
"I was here a little while ago."
"I threw it on the street."
"She looks very good."
"Your family, not mine."
"I think that's correct."
"I ask myself the same thing."
"Yes, and I to you."
"It's what you deserve."
"It's all in the report."
"We'll call him if we need him."
"I'm talking about your daughter."
"I want you to have a good time."
"Short, long, long, short, long."
"I don't understand anything."
"I know what you've done."
"Let's turn it around."
"Well, it's been a pleasure."
"I don't even think about that."
"I just got the message."
"It's here, somewhere."
"On your marks, get set, go."
"I already know what I want."
"That's what he would want."
"Let's see how to get out of here."
"It is a very nice place."
"I have a wife and two daughters."
"They treated us like family."
"Let's see how much that helps you."
"It's the men's bathroom."
"I told him I was fine."
"You'll know what you're doing."
"Of course I realize."
"I guess it's for the best."
"Keep the engine running."
"You have something on your nose."
"I'm going to count to one."
"Dear, we prepared lunch for you."
"That's not what I asked."
"You get on my nerves."
"Now is a good time."
"He seems to be a lunatic."
"We are about to start."
"Today is a beautiful day."
"It's not what I asked for."
"Please don't get up."
"It has to be around there."
"You saw it yourself."
"I want proof of life."
"I'm glad you think so."
"Love is everything."
"To you and me."
"I think I know the answer."
"This is going to be big."
"I think I have something here."
"And you are too."
"This has come for you."
"You are stronger than him."
"You should be proud of that."
"There has to be an answer."
"How much I need you."
"I'm going to trust you."
"I'm going to tell you everything."
"Yes, of course I know."
"Bring some water."
"Keep the line moving."
"You haven't returned my calls."
"Yes, he's a great guy."
"You know what I can do."
"How good it is here."
"It is very important to her."
"Give me some credit."
"All men do it."
"We'll do it another time."
"Yes, if you don't mind."
"I'm so sorry about yesterday."
"Please give us that opportunity."
"I won't leave without him."
"You can't see anything."
"I think that turned out well."
"Look, there it is again."
"It's as if it doesn't exist."
"I will be with you all the time."
"Our lives depend on it."
"It's an ad looking for servants."
"At ten o'clock sharp."
"I think we already did it."
"Come here, give me a hug."
"Red Route Number One."
"We must learn to live together."
"Give me a couple of days."
"I bet you will."
"Don't come back without the stones."
"Going from here to there."
"That looks very good."
"There are even group portraits."
"Drink some tea."
"This is a serious matter."
"Well, it's time to go."
"I hope it's something good."
"I guess anything is possible."
"I've seen it on television."
"Two in the morning."
"I'll see you at the house."
"The name says it all."
"You know better than I do."
"This is how it feels."
"One hand washes the other."
"In the middle of the night."
"But now it's my turn."
"You have to come right now."
"Your father would be very proud."
"I already have your trunk ready."
"Go do your thing."
"It's the same old thing."
"I am very aware of that."
"This is a delicate situation."
"One does what one can."
"A shot in the head."
"He was a very decent man."
"You're right about one thing."
"Have a little patience."
"The streets are safer."
"She is a great girl."
"I have to think of something."
"I'll go talk to them."
"It is essential that you remember this."
"He has been very good to me."
"Not a fly can get in here."
"I'm a meat stick."
"I have to stay calm."
"I put it on my forehead."
"I give the orders here."
"And a cup of coffee."
"Everyone went home."
"I bet you're right."
"This is really high."
"I was telling you my story."
"It's so good to have you back."
"I'll see you in a few days."
"I brought the girl."
"He is hereby suspended from his duties."
"I'm on the blacklist."
"The guy is a legend."
"It's just that: a story."
"I see one of them."
"Don't do that, please."
"Everything else is going great."
"I'll call him in the morning."
"So, you have accepted the truth."
"I like what you say."
"In that case, that's fine."
"I'll tell you what you can do."
"To each one of them."
"That's a nice hat."
"But the dog bit him."
"They are hotter than us."
"Not even with your grandfather."
"You and everyone else."
"Send someone to negotiate."
"Try some of this."
"I need to see my son."
"Well, do what you want."
"Thank you very much for the tea."
"For me it's the same."
"I should be in bed."
"I want to have my own life."
"Oh, for the love of God."
"I must be what I want."
"I'll call you in two hours."
"I'm going to go for it."
"At your service, my captain."
"That seems to be all."
"A game or something."
"A phenomenon of nature."
"I won a dance contest."
"The usual, please."
"All forms of life."
"Well, that's the thing."
"On top of the world."
"I think you should stay here."
"We both have our own lives."
"You have to get rid of him."
"The relationship with the father."
"I knew he had a secret."
"They took your brother from you."
"We have to go to work."
"My lamp and my plates."
"Twice in one day."
"I don't think they will."
"I reserved this seat for you, Father."
"I'm in the front row."
"Tell him I send him my regards."
"I want to be a police officer."
"I've already made the decision."
"This is for my sister."
"Put your hand on it."
"We all have work to do."
"I just want to know the truth."
"Well, here we are again."
"We'll see each other at my factory."
"It was one of those things."
"The fourth was a bird."
"A woman with a sword."
"I know exactly what to do with you."
"I want you out of here."
"He's sure to win."
"There's not much to say."
"I have written you a letter."
"He doesn't think about anything else."
"But be careful with the stairs."
"The shower has automatic washing."
"I've had enough good news."
"I love Chinese food."
"I forgot about the automatic car wash."
"This is going to be tough."
"She gets involved in everything."
"It's a very good start."
"Exactly what I'm looking for."
"The current is very strong."
"You can call me when you learn English."
"I tell you this from experience."
"The search for truth."
"Don't get her into this."
"I think you guys know each other."
"I'm really going to enjoy this."
"And he's looking for the address."
"Let me see if I understand correctly."
"It has been a wonderful day."
"We should talk more often."
"Like a million dollars."
"I think we're being attacked."
"Of course I'll marry you."
"It's your wedding night."
"Either you want to or you don't."
"For what I've done."
"Again from the beginning."
"If we reach the fog."
"The house looks good."
"Think about what you are saying."
"I was there when he landed."
"I have to agree."
"So let's toast to his fame."
"It was the only one I had."
"You told him yourself."
"It's Tuesday night."
"I love you too, son."
"With a hood and a mask."
"They've all left."
"Not that I have seen."
"So I have some time."
"I'm going to clear my name."
"This place is a madhouse."
"I'm very good at it."
"We'll do it one more time."
"Thank you for bringing it home."
"A spider in the garden."
"And I think you need something."
"I think we can please you."
"You're very good at this."
"All fighters are ready."
"And I'm definitely very thirsty."
"They must hide somewhere."
"Listen, look at it this way."
"It's the last thing I want."
"A gift for my wife."
"That was last Friday."
"It's easy for a professional."
"The first one on the left."
"I think everything is fine."
"I'm going to get the car."
"You have to be smarter."
"This is the last phase."
"They were voices, I tell you."
"It suits you better."
"I do it for others."
"He's very clever at that."
"That's it from here."
"This way, ladies and gentlemen."
"He said something I didn't understand."
"My last day of work."
"The great mouse expert."
"We're finally getting something."
"This is going to be good."
"You are a very romantic man."
"This place is a tomb."
"To each and every one."
"And I love you, Dad."
"You've come a long way."
"We have very good people."
"He knows you're after him."
"Now we can't do anything."
"I was just with him."
"This is a great day."
"It wasn't what I expected."
"The woman was the blonde."
"Or it will be cat food."
"Women love it."
"That's what I wanted to say."
"I went to bed."
"Anyone can rob a bank."
"Yes, it's an Irish ship."
"He has achieved a wonderful life."
"I already have what I wanted."
"Let's see what you're made of."
"How much longer to a step?"
"Oh yes you are the best."
"Look what's going on."
"I want you to leave now."
"Make it look good."
"I'm talking about the next corpse."
"I think I've seen her."
"Your parents had it too."
"That's a good example."
"Mine is bigger."
"It's going to turn out well for you."
"A means to an end."
"I was talking to the cat."
"Let it be a clean game."
"That feels so good."
"You have that power too."
"You're like family."
"Like the rest of us."
"We have to get going."
"We'll talk when I get home."
"I've got my eye on them."
"Go check on him."
"I feel it in the air."
"I can't talk about that."
"We keep all the meat here."
"The part into a thousand pieces."
"The second quadrant, please."
"Not when we almost have it."
"It is a very subtle art."
"I think that's fine."
"Get out of here right now."
"I want them back."
"We have done a good job."
"Whatever you say, honey."
"You can leave the door open."
"I got him a job here."
"Of everything I love."
"Ah, our trip to the Gulf."
"We have a nice mortgage too."
"I'm going to give you this."
"How strange life is."
"Anything you want to say."
"Tit for tat."
"Because he's telling the truth."
"Get out of there right now."
"I'm going to do the right thing."
"I have to get back to the bridge."
"There's something I need to know."
"Curious name for an Englishman."
"Women will love it."
"Please, you have to believe me."
"See you when we see you."
"That we have the air."
"There are more boats up front."
"Those were his last words."
"It means everything to me."
"I like everything about you."
"Let them make their own calls."
"I need to do one more thing."
"Everyone knows it's true."
"Just a minute, I promise."
"I just want the girl."
"The boy is safe."
"It's the only one we have."
"We're on our way right now."
"Please let this work."
"Everyone put something in."
"He lives across the street from my house."
"Those boys are not white."
"This is much more important."
"I guess we're even."
"He now lives with his parents."
"I've thought about this a lot."
"They do what they are told."
"Please do not touch anything."
"The worm is the spice."
"I want to be a fighter pilot."
"Well, I'm glad to see you."
"Let's get into the elevator."
"I want to make a deal with you."
"One minute to impact."
"How generous of you."
"He can be trusted."
"You'll have to wait your turn."
"You are one of us now."
"Beautiful, time for something good."
"It was an exchange of information."
"Every day the same."
"Let's go see mom."
"I'm going to listen now."
"I have to teach a class."
"We're going there right now."
"This place is a pigsty."
"And now I know why."
"Just a couple of things."
"The guy is very good."
"It's my first day here."
"I'll be able to buy a car soon."
"Tell that to my father."
"Make an effort to answer."
"The same procedure as before."
"He has prejudices against Italians."
"She is a good person."
"Any time now."
"The vampires attacked during the day."
"I like them too."
"The people of light."
"I have my eye on her."
"I know you did."
"The alignment of the worlds."
"I told them I believed you."
"I've already thought about that."
"I am a very lucky man."
"We have to move it."
"They said you might be here."
"This is a servant thing."
"I need to speak to my lawyer."
"You did it, really."
"But they were almost always looking for money."
"I need you to come with us."
"We make it to measure."
"Not that I was the first."
"Because he's an excellent boy."
"And it's just the beginning."
"I went to see someone."
"They are both perfectly fine."
"I already told you about him."
"I'm ready to go now."
"Don't leave without saying goodbye."
"I'm totally in love with you."
"I'm free now, actually."
"That is the correct answer."
"Communication is the key."
"Tomorrow will be another tough day."
"You haven't told them anything."
"Computers would have seen it."
"But I have to do this."
"You know what this means."
"I never wanted this to happen."
"Look at a castle, any castle."
"I have enough strength for this."
"I meant it as a compliment."
"I don't think you should do it."
"I want to introduce you to my friends."
"I'll have to start over."
"And that's the point."
"Sometimes it doesn't even appear."
"It's so easy for you."
"I'll see you in the car."
"All right, open your eyes."
"You have to be more careful."
"Thank you for being so kind."
"It is beyond everything."
"You'll be out in a year and a half."
"They have the right to remain silent."
"I know better than you."
"Men love it."
"That was my best show."
"I have to return some videos."
"All right, guys, let's eat."
"I'm going to bring her back."
"Sir, you need to see this."
"Call me as soon as you know something."
"I had to keep them safe."
"This is God's work."
"Give them a real drink."
"I'll never see her again."
"I want you to drop this case."
"We'll talk again when I get back."
"It's because of your love."
"All officers to the bridge."
"Building a bridge with her."
"I have to go find her."
"It's what you always wanted."
"I've always wanted to say that."
"You're scaring the children."
"That's right, my young friend."
"You're not leaving here."
"We're in the middle of something."
"I kept the photograph."
"Thank you for coming for me."
"At six o'clock sharp."
"Nobody knows except me."
"It's the best we have."
"Please, I have a girl."
"And do what he says."
"He was here the whole time."
"And we both know why."
"I have a family to feed."
"It only appears in photographs."
"I'm going home now."
"The Lord has blessed us."
"You can't breathe here."
"That happened a long time ago."
"If I see you, you pay a deposit."
"It was you all along."
"Well, I have one for you."
"You have been so kind to me."
"Star Wars."
"Please turn off the light."
"Well, he's a white man."
"If there's shooting, it's us."
"I'm going to be on television."
"The name of the company."
"He is a big fan of yours."
"It's a letter from school."
"It could be any of us."
"And may the best man win."
"It's a kind of demonstration."
"It was a pleasure meeting you, sir."
"Take your finger off the trigger."
"You've done this before."
"He liked that I had a job."
"That's the right question."
"At least not for now."
"He has the memory of an elephant."
"I think he'll be fine."
"I came to get you out of here."
"I've heard a lot from you."
"I had to try it, you know."
"I'll take you to your room."
"I'm going to rise to the occasion."
"A truth as big as a temple."
"Yes, very good, very good."
"I have a lot to do today."
"So far I've been lucky."
"I'm fine, I can see better now."
"Do it or don't."
"I have something on my neck."
"Full steam ahead."
"He is a business client."
"One of the largest."
"It's a costume party."
"I think you already did."
"This is from me."
"You're going to be okay, buddy."
"I would give my life for them."
"You were proud to come here."
"I'm going to the city."
"Things have to change."
"And it is a powerful ally."
"I just set the stage."
"I'm going to go get her."
"Keep your head high."
"Give me some sugar."
"This is about my father."
"They were playing with the pillows."
"You'll say that for yourself."
"I guess that's something."
"We can do something about it."
"This room is very dramatic."
"I want to go back home."
"Automatic washing in the shower."
"I was at home for an hour."
"I'm going to write all this down."
"Don't marry him."
"Thank you for flying with us."
"I love the golden dress."
"This is a sacred place."
"It's not good for him."
"The bet is still on."
"And we'll get out of here."
"Just like last year."
"You wanted me to find it."
"With everything I have."
"It's the only thing I know."
"You know the exact place."
"Or at least that's what I read."
"I'm going to get something to drink."
"They are from 'Stars and Stripes'."
"Your father was a friend."
"Go to the main staircase."
"I've seen it twice."
"I liked what you did."
"So this stays with me."
"Agents and gentlemen, your attention."
"That will set you free."
"I like being here with you."
"We have to go see her."
"I really like this painting."
"I just wanted to know how you were."
"Yes, it's my first time."
"We all liked him."
"The main staircase is secured."
"Now calm down and explain this to me."
"I need a place to stay."
"As well as your rebel fleet."
"I'm glad you say that."
"It's appropriate, I assure you."
"Faster than a speeding bullet."
"Remember that you are under oath."
"That will be your kingdom, son."
"I've been thinking about something."
"And because I loved you."
"That's what I try to do."
"I promise I will."
"We're going back home."
"It seems they will take you."
"Please clear this entrance."
"Yes, one moment, please."
"He is like that by nature."
"But we can't do anything."
"God bless you, brother."
"The Code is the law."
"Details sell your story."
"It looks good on you."
"It would be the best for everyone."
"This guy pays our bills."
"Don't start, I have to go."
"You're in deep water."
"Make sure you make the snake."
"In a chain of command."
"That's a good story."
"Man creates the dinosaur."
"Oh, please, please."
"This wasn't supposed to happen."
"Or at least I think so."
"And here is the proof."
"You, take the first floor."
"I have to get rid of him."
"Please get on the bus."
"I'm going to take action."
"The police of four million."
"You did very well, boy."
"Fun for the whole family."
"I'm having a good time here."
"It's been a pleasure, sir."
"You've done it again."
"He lived for more than a month."
"I'll take him to his room."
"I need to talk to you privately."
"Go do your job."
"So I take another step."
"It has been a great experience."
"It makes perfect sense to me."
"I'm going out with her."
"I have to close the beach."
"This is a family building."
"My brother from another mother."
"The hostages are safe."
"They are all over the city."
"Wherever you go."
"It was a very good system."
"The best in town."
"I have to know why."
"I thought we were going to the airport."
"This is a man's thing."
"I'll be ready in a second."
"But you're going to be okay."
"Capable of blowing up a bunker."
"That will be more than enough."
"I've told you before."
"Giving the evacuation signal."
"She has been very good to me."
"It's for the other side."
"What happened, who am I playing against?"
"He can't do it with three barrels."
"Everyone is looking at us."
"I knew you wouldn't be ready."
"Have you seen my new tits?"
"It's half past nine."
"Please, it is very important."
"It gives man instincts."
"They will bring you to your knees."
"We'll see each other in the field."
"Nobody except your two friends."
"That's a long conversation."
"And it was only once."
"The search for the Holy Grail."
"See you on the bridge."
"I'll take you to bed."
"They deserve what they got."
"Please tell me where it is."
"All right, stay the course."
"Let's see if they do this."
"It's exactly what I wanted."
"You're very good at it."
"That includes you."
"I was referring to the food."
"You've done enough for me."
"Ready for light speed."
"The only family he has."
"They can smell it on me."
"Please, it's a pleasure."
"They said it's on the way."
"But look on the bright side."
"It's the best for now."
"Yes, I would love a coffee."
"It's exactly what it sounds like."
"Listen, I need to talk to you."
"I have things on my mind."
"Thank you for doing all this."
"Hey, you can't do that."
"He goes and calls from home."
"Your parents fought against him."
"Don't add too much onion."
"They are only an hour late."
"The girls' high school."
"You betrayed the US."
"I have two parties a year."
"It's a tracking device."
"Beauty and the beast."
"This is a family matter."
"I've never liked it much."
"I thought it would be bigger."
"A march or something."
"It is to show the mobile."
"And my friend is outside."
"I could stay here forever."
"But you did the right thing."
"I believe that everything is possible."
"And their job is to protect you."
"Nothing can prevent that now."
"Because wars cost money."
"No songs with me."
"I'm looking for my sister."
"We have a lot of work ahead of us."
"I was here all night."
"I have to catch up."
"I'm going to put you on hold."
"Red dress, striped shoes."
"I wonder why that is."
"You better see this."
"A lady is getting up."
"I am also a professional."
"Not that you need it."
"Make sure it stays that way."
"My name is Mr. Orange."
"Clear your mind of questions."
"Well, I'll see you later."
"And now it's my turn."
"I know how that feels."
"It's just put like that."
"But it's what you wanted."
"That was good, very good."
"Assistant District Attorney."
"Maybe because of the content."
"I knew I had seen him."
"It's our wedding night."
"Come on, we have to go."
"They must have gone up the stairs."
"Now I want to go home."
"I want to get on with my life."
"To ask, you have to pay."
"I see myself."
"That's going to cost you."
"May God reward you."
"He says everything is fine."
"The accused should stand up."
"I see it, I have it."
"Only what you carry inside."
"Not so fast, please."
"You know what that means."
"I'll stay here for a while."
"Man destroys God."
"Only on weekends."
"It was a wonderful evening."
"You've had a good day."
"I went to see him yesterday."
"You might want to make a call."
"It's a jungle out there."
"It's amazing how much you've come."
"Please, I have to do it."
"See you at the door."
"It's a good time to say goodbye."
"They already have my family."
"It's different looking down."
"Don't ever do that again."
"It can't be that big."
"But now they are free men."
"I already know what happened."
"He has behaved very well."
"The girls love it."
"I dropped my pen."
"People are already leaving."
"I think I'll go to the bathroom."
"Yes, yes, I think so."
"I'll pass the rest later."
"The witness can go."
"Because of how you tell things."
"Try fairy tales."
"This is where you should be."
"Make it worth it."
"Watch what you say."
"Go with God, my son."
"He had something in his eye."
"I can't say the same."
"Love at first sight, it exists."
"Good afternoon, ladies and spirits."
"I think we've met before."
"Three percent, please."
"Just get up to date."
"I like nice men."
"I work to earn a living."
"That's in the morning."
"Just do what I say."
"The lady is your mother."
"And you need a crew."
"The smile of a jury."
"I'm glad you enjoy it."
"But it's worth finding out."
"You were never in second place."
"I suggest you leave now."
"We'll do it the old-fashioned way."
"America is a free country."
"They think they're all big."
"You don't give up."
"At least it's good for something."
"Let's see what it's all about."
"That's a big help."
"That is very helpful."
"This is how they do it."
"They have to get out of there."
"A five-man job."
"I owe it to her."
"The oldest of all."
"Take the elevator down."
"Message from Starfleet."
"He's coming for me."
"You do what everyone else does."
"Bring the boat over here."
"In the name of the law."
"I have lived an interesting life."
"He just likes it a lot."
"Come on, give me your hand, give it to me."
"It's a strange time now."
"You are fine and you are good."
"The days go on and on."
"He is talking to his wife."
"There has to be another way."
"So explain the telegram."
"They look great together."
"It's me, in this body."
"I think I can go now."
"Bring the marine sergeant."
"And chew tobacco like a man."
"But not in this case."
"They are not doing their job."
"I was made for that program."
"As fast as they can."
"I'm glad you like it."
"I told you you'd want to answer."
"I didn't say anything about you."
"Please make me real."
"And now, the main course."
"I'm saying they were there."
"Well, look on the bright side."
"It's not in the store."
"To my mother's house."
"It has everything I need."
"Login to the security system."
"You've done well here."
"I will work wherever and whenever."
"I had a great time with you."
"They even cut off her tits."
"Girls, same, on the right."
"I hope you enjoy your time together."
"I tell her that I love her."
"I once had a girlfriend."
"I'm going to show you helicopters."
"There's an agent up front."
"Now things have changed."
"There's plenty of room for more."
"Because it has to be clear."
"We are equal, you and I."
"Helped my fiancée last night."
"I'll have to train him, of course."
"You know you don't eat."
"I need a pair of handcuffs."
"It's like coming home."
"I have worked all day."
"It's mom's birthday."
"I should definitely see that."
"I am a nobody."
"Thanksgiving Day."
"And you claim to be our mother."
"I prefer to see you just the way you are."
"In the next Suspended Development."
"Thank you for a lovely evening."
"In the best ones, of course."
"That leads to the dark side."
"I've been here all night."
"I was glad to see that."
"See you in a moment."
"The captain gives the orders."
"We must do something and fast."
"I don't think it was."
"Remember, water is life."
"It will be business, politics and all that."
"Not even a werewolf."
"There is talent, I believe it."
"Until the weekend."
"It may be a human thing."
"Well, that changes things."
"To the letter."
"Hey, who's home?"
"Thank you very much for the invitation."
"That's why it's so important."
"I hear it all the time."
"We must give them more than print."
"Today is a new day."
"Come on, I thought you were fast."
"I will be a mother to him."
"I'm winning anyway."
"Maybe it's not necessary."
"That's just part of it."
"This is not necessary, old man."
"There's someone else in there."
"Miss, you shouldn't have been here."
"Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail."
"I must get on my boat."
"It's in the main hall."
"We're going to be fine."
"It's there, on the desk."
"I know they are our boys."
"Well, there are about seven of them."
"I'm sorry about your husband."
"One hundred and one next month."
"I made this for you."
"You and I are different."
"She speaks loudly, she is somewhat old."
"People always ask us."
"Whatever, whenever."
"I will never forgive you for this."
"Be a good boy, go on, son."
"You're always watching the news."
"I'm going to keep it."
"The subconscious is very powerful."
"The police officer turns off his siren."
"The bills need to be paid."
"Tomorrow is your big day."
"It's a lucky name."
"You still have your balls."
"I'm relaxed, but I need it."
"So I did a little research."
"Now, fast forward to today."
"And a glass of whiskey."
"They had their wife."
"He loves big butts."
"I think they're paying him."
"You've had a lot of work, yes."
"Only women for now, sir."
"It's a place to live."
"Look with your own eyes."
"Two and a half years ago."
"But you must trust me."
"See that they are well tied."
"That's it, a little more."
"The news has spread."
"Good morning to both of you."
"This has to be good."
"I respect what he has done."
"I've heard the phone tapes."
"I told you to stay."
"You have a nice place here."
"I have a secret too."
"This guy is very good."
"Let's talk about you again."
"That's my day off."
"Because I ask you to."
"It's like in the movies."
"I guess you can repeat that."
"Yes, I've already done it."
"We can do this another day."
"I'm going to do my job."
"Of course we knew."
"Those were the good times."
"I would like some tea when I get back."
"This way, I'll take it."
"You must go to school."
"You can open it on New Year's."
"We have to talk about something."
"I have to go back to the center."
"You are safe with us."
"The city of the living."
"Playing is for children."
"She will never be safe."
"Yes, that's the place."
"Each one has its key."
"But that's the point."
"Cat and mouse."
"There's something I need to tell you."
"I'll be here on New Year's."
"On the park bridge."
"I managed to get through to his boss."
"That's all your speed, sir."
"Two things disappeared this afternoon."
"Keep all windows closed."
"I'm saving up for a car."
"I think it's a good thing."
"They know we are here."
"That separates our species."
"We were for a while."
"I was looking forward to seeing you eating."
"Listen, this has an easy solution."
"I'm going to put them in water."
"I want you to do one thing."
"Like adults do."
"Yes, she was a big girl."
"Look at his little Russian house."
"Yes, you will do very well."
"It's payday, guys."
"Winter turned into spring."
"But it leads to more places."
"With the care he took."
"I'm from the Round Table."
"A bullet in the stomach."
"You said it, Dad."
"I have to go bet."
"In fact, like half."
"The first and the last."
"This way it's much faster."
"Good night, Mom and Dad."
"I'll see you at the party."
"I can't take this anymore."
"I pray that's it."
"A long, continuous chain."
"Everything on the list."
"I'll stay on the couch."
"Whatever that is."
"I see myself grabbing the Stone."
"You didn't say the Magic Word."
"Tomorrow is Thanksgiving."
"I thought you were talking about him."
"Go see what happens."
"The oars in place."
"I'm sorry I brought this up."
"I have to find a job."
"I've called you twice."
"Now say it quickly twice."
"I'm surprised to hear you say that."
"Not in the slightest."
"I'm very proud of her."
"I was just a little girl."
"As if I were at home."
"Open the gate right now."
"It seems like it's been there for years."
"Give me a chance to breathe."
"It is my duty as a gentleman."
"Grab your things and go."
"I've told you about her."
"This is where they did it."
"There's plenty of room for you."
"That looks like a peacock."
"Well, he's on his way."
"That's a good start."
"All you can eat."
"I love you too, honey."
"Now get out of my office."
"Yes, Dad, you already said it."
"The Blue Fairy is fine."
"I'll see what he does."
"There is a life at stake."
"Just what I was thinking."
"I've seen something like this before."
"Have a safe trip."
"Look, a Latin inscription."
"I'm going to read it to you."
"Tell him to come home."
"I have important matters to attend to."
"Now I remember you."
"My man will manage."
"I am a Time Lord."
"Sir, he wants to talk to you."
"This is for something else."
"Enjoy your last walk."
"Let's have some tea."
"I want to talk to my sister."
"You're going to do great."
"It's just him and me."
"This is a swamp."
"And we'll just sit here."
"In fact, it will be two minutes."
"It's not that at all."
"You can say it was me."
"It will disappear first thing tomorrow morning."
"Let me think for a minute."
"You are saving your daughter."
"Thank you, that was very kind of you."
"We have places everywhere."
"He's had a long day."
"A living work of art."
"The boats are coming for us."
"Call me when you feel better."
"Then I'll go home."
"Take the horses to the stable."
"Look at that one, see how it jumps."
"Look what you have here."
"Just walk me to the door."
"Let me talk to the police."
"There was a third one up there."
"That's just a story."
"A friend from school."
"I suggest a coat and hat."
"I just came back from Poland."
"From this moment on."
"Maybe, but I have the tickets."
"I'll have another package on Thursday."
"Don't take any money out here."
"You have it in your hand."
"Look around you, honey."
"I didn't ask for your opinion."
"The rooms seemed almost empty."
"The name I told him."
"The night has just begun."
"With instinct, you don't need proof."
"And I love you, son."
"You and I are done."
"It's not worth it anymore."
"It is one of the best."
"Go to the other staircase."
"Sir, another ice alert."
"You've already mourned enough."
"She took a picture of him."
"I think we have something, sir."
"You are going to enter the bank."
"I think we agree."
"In there, in the closet."
"I don't like milk."
"I'm going to take care of her."
"Hey, I took this picture."
"The power of the press."
"Almost a million dollars."
"He has a very nice house."
"I've had a good life."
"I'm going to marry him."
"Nobody knows him like you do."
"Thanks for coming so late."
"For ten million rupees."
"As much as can be known."
"I knew something like this would happen."
"Protect your way of life."
"I mean that as a compliment."
"I'll see you at the wedding."
"I wish you all the best."
"I'll stick with this."
"It's past seven."
"It's time for you to eat."
"The closet door, come closer."
"Now go on your own."
"I'll take that as a sign."
"Both lawyers, to my office."
"Take a deep breath when I tell you to."
"Fourteen minutes since we started."
"Look what they've done."
"We have to move his paw."
"I don't think we have time."
"I hope everything is okay."
"He put it in my pocket."
"Of course you didn't."
"You're going to do well."
"All this is going to disappear."
"Somehow we will meet."
"I see you on the other side."
"I came to ask for your forgiveness."
"I have to get to the airport."
"Your father would be so proud."
"That's important to me."
"No pencils or pens."
"It's not on the map."
"Look and see who it is."
"It will be a pleasure for me."
"Maybe we can make a deal."
"I wonder where he is now."
"They are like brother and sister."
"I must obey my master."
"Being brilliant is not enough."
"Your luck is running out, my friend."
"Let it be the last time."
"That's a little unfair."
"Long live the queen."
"You left without saying anything."
"I am not his mother."
"Like your tax returns."
"But we have to do something."
"I just woke up here."
"It means nothing to you."
"It was a madhouse."
"I don't know much about him."
"He insisted on talking to him."
"That's a thing of the past."
"He still has some of my things."
"My kingdom for a horse."
"I'll go get the doctor."
"He knows the whole story."
"Ready and everything else."
"Every time I see you."
"You are in a safe place."
"What has he done for me?"
"My heart is beating very fast."
"That apartment was my life."
"I said it all the time."
"I want to follow my own path."
"See you tomorrow my sweet boys."
"To see my friends."
"I'm going to call mom."
"Then do something about it."
"It was a pleasure chatting with you."
"I am also a human being."
"Let's see how you jump now."
"They will take you to the airport."
"The discovery is quite possible."
"Trust me on this."
"Each sheep with its partner."
"I actually feel better."
"Please open that door."
"My lucky line."
"Well, the table is yours."
"Because he is my brother."
"We must protect the fighters."
"If you are like a tree."
"There's always next time."
"You have a dead-end job."
"He was wearing his light blue tie."
"It's like a big meeting."
"Wow, I don't know that."
"Only from time to time."
"There's one for everyone."
"Nobody comes to see her anymore."
"They knew him on the streets."
"But you are my friend."
"Or straight to the black market."
"Look over there and over there."
"One hour and fifteen minutes."
"And thank you for your cooperation."
"You have something on your mustache."
"I hope they fit you well."
"You have to clean up all of America."
"She had a baby, man."
"This is a little better."
"I've met so many guys."
"I'll take you to the station."
"You are late for class."
"We have to do this together."
"I'll be leaving in three days."
"The rules can always change."
"I hope we can be friends."
"I have it here, I have it."
"It's good to be back home."
"I wonder what he wants for breakfast."
"I think you did it."
"I'll call you in a few days."
"Come, take my hand, friend."
"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Consulate."
"Let the phone do the talking."
"I slept with a girl."
"I hope both."
"But few people know this."
"If I had earned more money."
"I see you've already met."
"The new day has arrived."
"Maybe it can be helpful."
"I'm very glad to hear that."
"Thank you for a wonderful dinner."
"The night watch has arrived."
"I work for the British government."
"Wear civilian clothes and comfortable shoes."
"But someone has to do it."
"Being safe is my job."
"Well, that's the point."
"Let me talk to her, honey."
"Ah, you had to do it, right?"
"The line of your hips."
"Go wash your face."
"The art of war."
"They are nothing more than words."
"If he dares."
"I'll catch up with you in a minute."
"Thank you for being quick, yes."
"Pick up your things and go."
"I've seen what they do."
"He was in a very good mood."
"I promised you I would."
"I'm with you, do it, do it, do it."
"You are absolutely right, sir."
"I have to go to the market."
"I guess it is now."
"We are all here for a reason."
"In a couple of minutes."
"Maybe it's more than that."
"And the cherry on the cake."
"They are out of town."
"I spoke to her on the phone."
"I came to see the play."
"I can read your mind."
"These are your new fingerprints."
"That's the good part."
"Come on, it's going to be fun."
"You knew how to handle the situation."
"But don't tell him."
"I found some cheese."
"It is planted with a four."
"Better that he doesn't know."
"It's the Meat Fair."
"They put you on a list."
"It's a very beautiful song."
"I want tickets to the opera."
"This is my first day."
"It is included in the price."
"At my mother's house."
"Now I'm hungry again."
"That'll get you started."
"It looks like my school."
"I've given it a lot of thought."
"Well, you talk to the right one."
"They just passed by there."
"I'm sure he does."
"The Pope is seriously ill."
"I want to talk to him now."
"I said we're leaving."
"I'm sorry about this afternoon."
"Yes, the door was closed."
"Make sure it is."
"It's one of those days."
"But this storm is different."
"I've never had a hunch."
"Because I love that show."
"Thank you very much and good night."
"Same with ink."
"Things are going well for him."
"A print of your thumb."
"I'm going to change my phone."
"That man is a genius."
"I've got plenty of time, baby."
"City and state, please."
"But it is an acceptable copy."
"Yes, this is the place."
"They are the ones who count."
"It's a kind of cape."
"Now I can't do anything."
"Front and center."
"See you at the beach."
"It's hand lotion."
"It's already come true for me."
"I'm really looking forward to seeing you."
"That's why I like you so much."
"It was a love story."
"You're laughing at me."
"I can feel it in my bones."
"My daughter, the Swan Queen."
"I thought you were a soldier."
"It's all right, it's all right."
"I'd like to pay for your drink."
"He found her charming and pleasant."
"Listen to what I'm saying."
"I thought it might be helpful."
"I have the lab results."
"It is a sign of trust."
"But now everything is fine."
"I don't like girls."
"It wasn't necessary, but thank you."
"It's what we were waiting for."
"It's a bloodbath."
"You have a great life now."
"There has always been a senate."
"The mouth of truth."
"Your father's house."
"And we will be together forever."
"I need you to follow someone."
"The subject is on the way."
"Because I felt like it."
"I'm going to work on that."
"Tell the truth to everyone."
"Like in the Boy Scouts."
"He must be your age."
"That's what he said last week."
"They were taking him through the tunnel."
"Just tell me what you see."
"There is so much you don't know."
"Leave it and let's have some tea."
"I like that you are here."
"The code needs to be modified."
"God bless you, darling."
"In theory, we could stay here."
"You can see it in the dark."
"Dark and silent and complete."
"There's something on my mind."
"You'll see what I'm doing."
"I forgot where I was."
"It's right behind you."
"I admired his father."
"I think I'll take a walk."
"All right, ladies and gentlemen."
"You are a movie star."
"Because I asked him to."
"Now please tell me how."
"Go talk to her."
"Glad I found you."
"I know it's a lot to ask."
"I can't, I have to go."
"I have to pay the rent."
"By dawn we will be at war."
"This cross is not mine."
"They get what they deserve."
"They left and then it happened."
"Don't tell mom."
"I just wanted to keep you safe."
"Maybe she will stay."
"This furniture is my pride."
"I let him hear my footsteps."
"It's the best for both of us."
"I'm sure it is."
"He is getting better at his job."
"It's a pleasure to see you, brother."
"You know what I want to hear."
"But I have learned so much."
"I don't know, I'll think about it."
"I know the delivery date."
"Please take a look."
"The boys like it."
"There must have been a reason."
"I love this job, I love it."
"I'd rather you didn't do that."
"In the last two hours."
"Quite mature on your part."
"The signal is gone, guys."
"Don't tell him what to do."
"Thank God they arrived."
"And then, to my thing."
"It's a masked ball."
"This boy is a prodigy."
"May our children forgive us."
"I told him he doesn't drink."
"This operation is going to move forward."
"There are people who never learn."
"Go down the stairs, I say."
"That will brighten your day."
"It must have been a dream."
"My God, how beautiful you are."
"It is an entertainment service."
"I want to go somewhere else."
"I'm going to make it work."
"It can't just be a coincidence."
"The postman comes every Wednesday."
"Let's talk to them."
"I think it was that night."
"I've never heard you talk like that."
"You don't know what's out there."
"That condo was my life."
"It's a gift for him."
"Perfect in every way."
"This is important to you."
"I think everything will turn out well."
"You asked who those men were."
"The Empire is still out there."
"You know the lyrics."
"I try to do the right thing."
"I am a Treasury agent."
"I want to talk to your boss."
"The Jews receive nothing."
"If you put it there, perfect."
"You don't decide that part."
"Leave the rest to me."
"Okay, it's time to go."
"My boss wants to meet you."
"As it happened in the market."
"It's a photo album."
"Colonel, this is an order."
"Let's see what you find there."
"It was a shitty job."
"What should be our goal."
"The bathroom is this way."
"I'll call you when I know something."
"I didn't know anything about that."
"And now to finish this."
"I thought it was the wind."
"Anything for a friend."
"You better not do it."
"The only question is when."
"Even the one about dinosaurs."
"I must warn the others."
"I saw something very different."
"I don't make plans in advance."
"Look under your bed."
"I don't like boys."
"When they come in, don't say anything."
"I'm going to come get you."
"I only care about you."
"Please give me a chance."
"Well, things have changed."
"I'm going to fix things."
"Be a Knight of the Onions."
"Things are going very well."
"I said leave it."
"You have done a good job."
"Gentle young man, we have a police officer."
"Of course it's worth it."
"Wait for it to come out of the roof."
"I know you're going to win."
"I'm sorry about those guys."
"You are a very special boy."
"I think they didn't like it."
"I checked the room myself."
"Sir, the presentation is complete."
"We have to catch a plane."
"He likes beautiful women."
"Tomorrow will be an important day."
"That's all it says."
"I want to go to college."
"I think we have something here."
"It's a very pretty hat."
"Like a movie star."
"I'm working on that."
"You can't give up."
"I just want to be with her."
"The captain left the bridge."
"I am a nice man."
"It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am."
"Yes, I take you seriously."
"I don't think we should do it."
"There's something I must show you."
"You can have my truck."
"Your actions say otherwise."
"A bow and arrow."
"It might be very exciting."
"Third door on the left."
"I'm sorry you take it that way."
"Let's talk about this later."
"I want to talk to your mother."
"At least I did that."
"The money is safe."
"That's a great question."
"All the boys do it."
"It speaks very well of you."
"This one is even weirder."
"Let's see if we can find it."
"Everything turned out well in the end."
"A little more water."
"Let's have a cup of tea."
"Well, that's one theory."
"It was a pleasure, as always."
"Nobody will love you like I do."
"I tell you we can do it."
"This came after you left."
"There may be a slight chance."
"Go and do your job."
"Let me talk to you for a minute."
"Very well, a pleasure to see you."
"I'm going to turn on the power."
"I've always wanted to do that."
"Yeah, well, hurry up, take this."
"He finds you."
"Valentine's Day."
"It seems he's gone."
"It was all we had."
"Do it all in one shot."
"I would love to give you a hand."
"At least you got out of the tree."
"I would love to join the group."
"You just have to have faith."
"Well, that's our move."
"Until she leaves."
"You might think that."
"My father-in-law is the owner."
"They're fine, both of them are fine."
"And they will be happy about this."
"I know, I've seen it."
"Underwear sounds good."
"I have to brush my teeth."
"I will always return to that church."
"You go outside the city."
"He's on the blacklist."
"All systems are good."
"You have to put on those glasses."
"I want to make one thing clear."
"This is my second chance."
"A man came recently."
"I want the best for you."
"You were good there by the way."
"Thank you for a wonderful evening."
"Yes, it's going to be okay."
"The eighth wonder of the world."
"Yes, you're going to do it."
"God is the first servant."
"The items must be collected."
"Everything will look better tomorrow."
"Your stay could be long."
"The winner would have paid better."
"I'll tell him when he comes."
"They already had him."
"I think they didn't want to."
"I don't think I know her."
"He knew the time had come."
"We are in the 20th century."
"I'm sorry about your mom."
"The day of our murders."
"On the count of one."
"They have done very well."
"I'll be back next week."
"It's a love song."
"You will have company during the visit."
"Well you know the rest."
"I'm going to write this story."
"They want to know if it was us."
"Please wait without moving."
"You have to score a thousand points."
"I've never seen them before."
"And this is the bet."
"That I didn't live for him."
"Your hair is standing on end."
"But now he's not interested."
"I have told you the truth."
"Because the house always wins."
"Scissors cut paper."
"Give me the image in parts."
"The Department of Justice as well."
"Next time stay close."
"It's yours, if you want it."
"It's serious, and it takes time."
"We'll have to do it without him."
"Your voice hasn't changed."
"Let them give you the message."
"That's a big 'if'."
"I found this in my pocket."
"It looks like a water bottle."
"Easy come, easy go."
"My cabin is for them."
"An eye exam."
"I am the leader of the great movement."
"Ten years at sea."
"How you humans love comfort."
"I've never been to Philadelphia."
"There is a reward for your capture."
"It was a way of speaking."
"I'll see you in five minutes."
"But I demand that they pay."
"Allow me your attention for a moment."
"Because they're going to be together."
"It's not his best subject."
"He wants to know what you thought."
"I've always wanted your happiness."
"He's heading back to the mailbox."
"I read it a long time ago."
"Ghosts always surround us."
"I say you look beautiful."
"But it grew stronger."
"You're smarter than me."
"This is good news, guaranteed."
"That's why we will be careful and precise."
"I thought it was for the best."
"Say I'm the best."
"But I talked to your wife."
"You think we need one more."
"Honey, that's a boat."
"All coordinates are fixed."
"It was, but not anymore."
"From my point of view."
"I have the only belt."
"A large, white jewel."
"Avoid the decision altogether."
"It's about his daughter."
"You said you'd do anything."
"I just want to clear things up."
"That gives it its energy."
"You can leave the tip."
"I entrusted him with my defense."
"Let's see how it looks on you."
"I had to take a shortcut."
"I have to talk to dad."
"Get the armor out of there."
"You really need to see this."
"I'll have to cut the auxiliary."
"Now, step aside."
"You have to give me something better."
"She is not just any woman."
"I should ask you that question."
"It was his way of protecting me."
"We came here four years ago."
"There has to be a solution."
"This is starting to make sense."
"I think that's great."
"I was running in the canyon."
"I found her on the street."
"I think he is right."
"Our loyal friend is there."
"It must not reach America."
"Look where they put the kitchen."
"Empty is the opposite of full."
"Let's end this right now."
"Everything will return to normal."
"He had to ask me to leave."
"But I like your place."
"Tell him they're for me."
"I'm in charge now."
"I can't think of anyone."
"Your brother is there now."
"That's good for me."
"But here's the interesting part."
"It's my gift to you."
"Now I am on Earth."
"They said we have three days."
"The music of the spheres."
"There has to be something here."
"Interesting this morning."
"This will last us a while."
"And you let him in."
"Unless there was a reason."
"The accused stands up."
"It is my right as a man."
"You can talk to my subconscious."
"There is a lot of humidity here."
"There's something you need to see."
"Always surrounded by good things."
"We must put the loads."
"Thus two thousand years passed."
"The animals were the miracle."
"Let me put it on for you."
"I think he needs medical attention."
"I've heard about it."
"I decide the means."
"Next time, it will be flawless."
"It's a very remote possibility."
"It only tenses for a moment."
"The trigger is very sensitive."
"It's all I need."
"I'm offering you a deal."
"Yes, I have it, there it is."
"The voices in my head."
"They seem to be doing well."
"I also have works to do."
"Or that of the fish."
"Today is my last day."
"And now get out of here."
"I'm going to let you live."
"You were out all night."
"I never thought you were."
"It'll just be you and me."
"You're going to be okay, baby."
"I have to go, sweetheart."
"It can represent anything."
"And you can go home."
"Even under the Red Keep."
"But thanks for the offer."
"It is the best possible result."
"What you need to hear."
"There's one in the chamber."
"Happy Mother's Day."
"They got married in a church."
"It's not about them."
"I'll give him whatever he wants."
"Let me show you how it's done."
"We will see each other every day."
"Life found its way."
"This was just an observer."
"It may be for the best."
"It's just as it should be."
"I've given him everything."
"Okay, say it again."
"It's exactly what he wants."
"We will come out free, rich and famous."
"It's always better if it doesn't rain."
"I was about to go in."
"You know it's the right thing to do."
"We have to call someone."
"Give me some love."
"Look at all those people."
"A one-night robbery."
"You have to see that thing."
"But now everything is going well."
"But this time I need more."
"I know where the Ark is."
"I love you, you're my brother."
"This is how we make a living."
"It's showtime, folks."
"I already told you why."
"You're scaring the girls."
"Someone has come to see you."
"You can see everything from here."
"I would take it anyway."
"In the bottom drawer."
"Just get in here."
"I called you to tell you that."
"Well, let's go to the First."
"Wow, that was easy."
"They need a more direct route."
"You murdered my father."
"I know what this looks like."
"It's exactly what I need."
"Thank you for taking your time."
"A victory is a victory."
"Someone called the police."
"And I'm in love with you."
"A couple of minutes ago."
"Everyone knows The Black Castle."
"I know about those things."
"Get a real job."
"It is a very nice watch."
"With the police, please."
"I want to go everywhere."
"And you, take care of this."
"I can still see his face."
"Observation, the essence of the project."
"We still have things to do."
"And you are my trophy."
"My life changed forever."
"He always goes to that place."
"I am the captain of the team."
"You do your job very well."
"You are brave, but I won."
"That impresses the Germans."
"You have to say it right."
"You want to protect your people."
"Then another Thursday without a menu."
"That's quite a test."
"I thought you were going by car."
"I see myself holding the stone."
"That's what I have to do."
"I see there is a question."
"He takes something out of his pocket."
"Living inside other people."
"You are always so discreet."
"Gods, boy, that's enough."
"It's a kind of game."
"To whoever finds this note."
"We have French toast."
"He was also coming on vacation."
"Tell me what you think about this?"
"Yes, yes, I guess so."
"Tell me about when you worked here."
"I heard the story once."
"It was for all three things."
"I want to introduce you to some friends."
"You have to keep up appearances."
"They must want something from us."
"Your sister is gone."
"You can't do anything anymore."
"I'll always be here for you."
"Although no one is laughing."
"I'll leave it as homework for you."
"He was never a person."
"I'm sorry I have to do this."
"Everything else is secondary."
"I'll bet you anything you want."
"You know what I do."
"I know, I was here."
"You are a very good girl."
"Thank God we found her."
"Good work on the eye."
"And I want to know why."
"We met at the bar."
"You have to follow the script."
"Just tell me when you feel it."
"Return to your post, sailor."
"I didn't ask him to."
"We must go to the police."
"I've been to Earth."
"They think they know everything."
"Nobody knows him like I do."
"It is a very big place."
"I've known them for a long time."
"Tell him to follow the wires."
"I was thinking exactly the same thing."
"This new program is amazing."
"I came for the mineral waters."
"The walk will have to be suspended."
"I forgot, you never drink."
"They ask questions in hospitals."
"There is love in the world."
"Well, several things are said."
"I have to go back to class."
"I'm strong enough for this."
"Screwed yes, but not eliminated."
"You have one day to think about it."
"He is your teacher now."
"I will never be happy again."
"Sometimes I think so."
"We're going out again."
"The police depot."
"Between the bushes, up ahead."
"That's one of them."
"Money and drugs."
"I'm saving your life."
"He is a real man."
"I move with the wind."
"I have a different theory."
"Give this to him from me."
"Yes, he is a good boy."
"Each one on his own."
"You can eat whatever you want."
"It wasn't what it seemed."
"I know our side will win."
"Start the boot sequence."
"There will be enough time down there."
"I came to thank you."
"He needs a haircut."
"You're going to wake up the child."
"It's a completely different situation."
"I'm leaving, important news."
"Because that's the way things are."
"You know a lot about that."
"Maybe your whole identity will change."
"Look at the size of this."
"It's a very nice suit."
"You've seen thousands of them."
"When you are calm, at peace."
"I can't beat both of them."
"Because that turned out great."
"My son is very sick."
"You better come see this."
"It's something new for me."
"You all look the same."
"The world remains the same."
"I'm going to look for mom."
"It has been a great adventure."
"It's already past midnight."
"Yes, you are right about that."
"We'll have you in five minutes."
"That's what we'll solve."
"I have to take a bath."
"Ah, she didn't tell them."
"We are about to land."
"Give me a minute to think."
"Well, that's a secret."
"And you arrived just in time."
"You've never left here."
"She went to college."
"Check those numbers again."
"It will be my birthday present."
"If you want, I'll talk to him."
"There's one of your mom's."
"Please take your time."
"I knew something was up."
"I think he's tricked us."
"Thank you for paying my bail."
"I was thinking about that very thing."
"One last wish, please."
"I hope it's good news."
"It's a toolbox."
"I have it in my hand."
"It's better if they leave."
"You'll feel better when we get back."
"I think he does know."
"Don't believe a word he says."
"Sit by the campfire."
"Especially with the breasts."
"I'm going to be his wife."
"That's the way things should be."
"References are my specialty."
"I only offer my wish."
"Just a couple of hours."
"Watch your tongue, darling."
"Not after all this."
"All right, let's go right now."
"A penny for your thoughts."
"I was informed this morning."
"Going out to get some fresh air."
"Standing by my window."
"The children look like burnt paper."
"Do everything you can."
"A wonderful and brave man."
"I don't think it means anything."
"Look, we don't have much time."
"There must be something you want."
"My nerves are on edge."
"Now I can get out of here."
"All our heads have a price."
"I think you already knew that."
"Be sure to record everything."
"They said he had been imprisoned."
"Of course, it was always me."
"Just my son and I."
"And these are my children."
"Come here and look at this."
"Then it was locked."
"I want you to make a decision."
"The knight is already leaving."
"Because I can't take it anymore."
"Have some dignity."
"The Japanese fleet has disappeared."
"I have called him many times."
"A heart full of love."
"Find out everything you can."
"Please don't be like that."
"And then I saw the body."
"Call me when you receive this message."
"It's for your own protection."
"It's like a fingerprint."
"You have to catch the train."
"The court is in session."
"I don't think I want to know."
"I never forgot about you."
"Tell him not to come closer."
"Let your beard grow."
"I'll buy you whatever you want."
"All this has an explanation."
"There's someone in the bathroom."
"Tomorrow is my day off."
"Give me a one-way ticket."
"Turning the corner."
"The only thing we can do."
"I have to call home."
"It's half past two."
"I slept well on the couch."
"I think I'll take a look."
"Please check again."
"We have to go see."
"Of course you don't know."
"You have plenty of time to think."
"There is more than one class."
"He can't read English."
"A sedative must be added."
"I forgot the jelly."
"I'm in the groove."
"Breakfast is almost ready."
"My wife is very sick."
"The window was wide open."
"This will be our little secret."
"He leaves at one."
"We have them all the time."
"Let's not talk about those things."
"I'm the other guy."
"It's going well, it's going very well."
"It's simply medicine."
"I'll go see Victor."
"What we are going to do."
"I have come from very far away."
"I am a very special boy."
"Straight to voicemail."
"And one of those cookies."
"I would say very good."
"Grandma sends her regards."
"In fact, quite the opposite."
"I know I was."
"Anything, whatever."
"I am a man of science."
"Now, hold on to the net."
"It's a good time to travel."
"I bet you do too."
"You have to work to maintain it."
"That's what we have."
"I asked you not to do that one."
"I'll tell you where you could be."
"I just wanted to show you my guns."
"I'm going to the movies."
"Let's see how good they are."
"At the Library of Congress."
"Just a couple of questions."
"We'll be here all day."
"I would like to be your friend."
"It's better than being here."
"This is a private party."
"I saw it in a store."
"We create a world for ourselves."
"It's the rule of three."
"I don't want him in America."
"I think I found something here."
"That was two months ago."
"Those numbers are really good."
"Because I tell you so."
"You have to learn to relax."
"Almost everything is here too."
"Now make him pay for it."
"You were in the library."
"I must speak to the captain."
"They can see ghosts with them."
"I'm opening my soul to you."
"A moment of your attention."
"I was part of something special."
"For the end of the world."
"You are a complete human being."
"I have good news too."
"I have to pack my bags."
"We will have the memories of Paris."
"At the end on the left."
"Tell them what I told you."
"I'll call you when it's safe."
"You and I need to talk."
"Let's go see the boss."
"I think I can fix that."
"I have to see the play."
"Go get some rest."
"I don't think he knew."
"The husband of your dreams."
"You can be super without them."
"So close yet so far."
"I've seen it too."
"I think we can still move."
"They say you are good."
"She's like my sister."
"Something was happening to him, physically."
"We will send you all the information."
"Look what we're doing."
"I don't recognize his name."
"They are approaching our position."
"I'm working on something new."
"The people, my friend, the people."
"Your life force fades."
"Launch system not responding."
"I like men like that."
"Thank God you called."
"They call us to the table."
"I told you it would be okay."
"You're the only one left."
"If that's your choice."
"I'm one of the good ones."
"Your grades have been slipping."
"He likes you too."
"Here are all the details."
"Nobody saw who shot first."
"To bring it out of the light."
"I hope they hurry up."
"I think we've met."
"They don't, but I do."
"The facts are the facts."
"I want you in my life."
"Only neighbors are allowed in."
"That's not it at all."
"Oh Lord, bless this pomegranate."
"You did very well, old man."
"Let's wait and talk about it."
"This party is just getting started."
"Of course it's your door."
"So I offer satisfaction."
"They are from Internal Affairs."
"Three men and one woman."
"Take one of mine."
"Hey, look who's here."
"Let someone go with him."
"But not that he came late."
"The police are looking for her."
"I hope he doesn't have a cane."
"I hope it is not necessary."
"Now we know that his secretary."
"I come from a big family."
"It's one barricade after another."
"Nobody asked for your opinion."
"That's what you said last week."
"Moving on to what follows."
"The Liberty Bell."
"The less you see it, the better."
"On our honeymoon."
"I have been a good employee."
"Let's take him home."
"But the answer could be."
"We free people will do our best."
"There are all kinds of children."
"That we were going to grow old together."
"A body for a body."
"It's important that you understand that."
"And don't think so."
"And the house needs twelve."
"Sir, we have a launch order."
"I'm talking about my life."
"So far we've been lucky."
"Sir, you can't be here."
"I'm telling you straight up."
"I know you from somewhere."
"I was here all day."
"Keep your engines running."
"Now it's you and me."
"You were doing very well."
"I think it has something of mine in it."
"It is an uncommon surname."
"It's already on the roof."
"I said get up."
"I have to make another call."
"I'll get back to you."
"They are not on the train."
"I have to get him out of here."
"There's something I want to say."
"It is very important to him."
"This is just a precaution."
"Guys, you have to see this."
"Not without attracting attention."
"You used us at your whim."
"You can't talk to him."
"These are memories that I need to change."
"It's a gift I have."
"Someday I will be a knight."
"It's amazing what you did."
"I'm going to write about him."
"And for all the details."
"Little effort and a lot of publicity."
"Now you are the captain."
"May the force be with us."
"I really promise you."
"That music is for everyone."
"Move aside, kid."
"Then you can't be here."
"This is what remains."
"I saw it in my dream."
"I've never asked you for anything."
"I've already spoken to the police."
"The sun has set."
"It has been a real pleasure."
"He knows all the tricks."
"That was enough for me."
"I'd like to introduce you to someone."
"A gigantic amount of energy."
"It's better than the alternative."
"We are an endangered species."
"Yes, and I love you."
"You have to take off your hat."
"The cavalry is on its way."
"And I know what you are."
"I think you should leave quickly."
"I hope you understand the seriousness."
"Okay, I'll give you a test."
"They have done a great job."
"I needed some air."
"I forgot how fast you are."
"Just do what it says."
"It is what it should be."
"Let's get things straight."
"That's very good, honey."
"I think we'll let them go."
"I do, I really do."
"A silent propulsion system."
"You're a lucky guy."
"Give the dog your food."
"This time, it seems so."
"I have my information too."
"Yes, and you can say it again."
"It was a perfect day."
"That's why I brought it to you."
"That's fine with me."
"It seems that he likes it."
"I have to go get ready."
"She's been through a lot."
"You and I will be fine."
"This was my mother's."
"It's a place for children."
"And it's here right now."
"I'll win it for you."
"Look at what time it is."
"The captain is giving them."
"Sorry, that's all."
"I thought you guys were done."
"If it's any consolation."
"I mean the brothers."
"It better be in Paris."
"Well, now I have to think."
"And God bless you."
"Prove that you are still worth something."
"I thought I heard 'the four'."
"I can't just call him a man."
"Echo Three to Echo Seven."
"But we will see each other again."
"Further on, there is a pharmacy."
"I hope you recover soon."
"I've never heard that expression before."
"Preparing the target, main generator."
"I have to catch a train."
"I need to find my son."
"I don't think about it much."
"You're very famous around here."
"Tell us something we don't know."
"I even thought they were ghosts."
"Let me see if I understand you."
"At least we know where it is."
"We are part of your life."
"I've never been to Europe."
"I have to take the call."
"I have to go on a trip."
"You must remember something about him."
"I know what's here."
"My eyes are prettier."
"We'll see each other at the river."
"Maybe you should take it easy."
"I'm going straight to the kitchen."
"I made a deal with him."
"My ally is the Force."
"If you can do it, I can do it."
"That's how I was, if you remember."
"I'll see you at the exit."
"Come here, I want to talk to you."
"Everything you fight for."
"Tomorrow will be a busy day."
"There has to be some explanation."
"You know why we are here."
"Once upon a time there was a carpenter."
"I asked you how old he is."
"I went into the bathroom with her."
"Give me the money, please."
"There are other places to check."
"It is a rite of initiation."
"Now you're going to find out."
"Maybe you should get yourself a girlfriend."
"But I'm going to tell you something."
"And a plane ticket."
"There is something in the fog."
"I'll see you at the airport."
"And we'll have all the money."
"Three, four hours, daily."
"Let's see what he's going to do."
"These glasses are very original."
"The work is already established."
"Yes, my love, it's me."
"I mustn't talk about that."
"I've told you about him."
"I haven't seen you lately."
"Yes, it's going to be great."
"The vultures are circling."
"You don't know it well."
"You have been very good to me."
"Well, that's my proposal."
"There's something you should know."
"It's a good time to start."
"Monday night."
"That's what it looked like."
"Your country is at war."
"Yes. I'm fine, Red Leader."
"It is the sense of touch."
"When I get this straight, I'll be fine."
"Yes, that would be very good."
"Come in and take a look."
"The luck of the Irish."
"So let me explain something to you."
"But you forgot about me."
"Prisoners are cheaper."
"Tomorrow will be a tough day."
"Listen, you need a new door."
"I think he's done it."
"It's for good luck."
"I always considered you a son."
"I'm starting to like this."
"We are ghosts to them."
"I need to know if you're with me."
"The police already know."
"Sometimes things come back."
"I have to start over."
"Naturally, between brother and sister."
"Some friends are on the way."
"This is going to be fantastic."
"It's perfect, and you know it."
"Of course it's magic."
"Time to start the show."
"Not if we do it right."
"The place where she lives."
"He's just doing his job."
"The friends I've made."
"It's her maiden name."
"I wish you all the happiness."
"One of them, above all."
"Sorry, it can't be."
"Yesterday I went to your house."
"I think I've seen it before."
"But I just want to talk to you."
"It was my turn to make dinner."
"Tell them where they want to go."
"Let's see if you understand."
"I have to go out again."
"It's the best thing for him."
"I used to know them all."
"Yes, our new Swan Queen."
"There's something I want to do."
"It's starting to get cold."
"I would like to keep the boy."
"On the beaches, looking for fuel."
"Call me to go shopping."
"We just got home."
"I heard it on the news."
"Well, these things happen."
"You hadn't decided yet."
"I wish I had known this before."
"I want you on the team."
"They really want those glasses."
"Now I'm going to let this go."
"Well, what's mine is yours."
"Give me a list of alternatives."
"Ask him, he's been there."
"I'll stay with the boy."
"I have to fix things."
"I'm ready for the best."
"I've always been happy with you."
"And it was going to be."
"With a good dive, maybe."
"A baby in the bag."
"The boy had white hair."
"Give me the ship's plans."
"Nobody asks to be a hero."
"But not right now."
"Yes, it looks very good."
"You might be able to find out the combination."
"There is gold in the temple."
"There are toys everywhere."
"He is just like his father."
"That was a good day."
"Look what you've accomplished."
"I was the police here."
"You'd have to get much closer."
"And then you apologized."
"I want to go home now."
"I am the good shepherd."
"Few families control such companies."
"Thank you for using my path."
"That happens all the time."
"I'll see her in the morning."
"I had a great time today."
"The music is very loud."
"Yes, that's all true."
"I try to thank him."
"I'm leaving here now."
"I want to solve this completely."
"Women are all the same."
"I'll never let you go."
"The world is a jungle."
"They are families like mine."
"I want to keep the boy."
"Anyway, good to see you."
"Not even for a second."
"And up, two, three, four."
"Boys, do what you want."
"Well, it's been a delight."
"Behind the yellow line."
"I thought you had left."
"And I will be with them."
"And I'm happy for you."
"The doctor is on his way."
"Come with me for a few weeks."
"They come in with a beautiful scent."
"You haven't told him."
"I told you to leave it."
"I liked it too."
"It will be here shortly."
"I've learned a lot since then."
"Now the Beast is immortal."
"Ah, the mail has arrived."
"She thinks she's in love."
"I'm reading this very well."
"On paper, in theory, yes."
"Show me what you have there."
"The seeker of prophecy."
"To clean up your public image."
"You have the advantage, love."
"Remember, keep your voice low."
"I'm going to give you another chance."
"Call your first witness."
"I'm sorry about your job."
"I'll be fine in a minute."
"The best invention in the world."
"I knew you wanted to be a singer."
"Nobody goes home."
"He is like music."
"Yes, that's fine by me."
"You should have seen their faces."
"Every family has them."
"It takes a whole day to cook."
"I'm going to have to give up."
"That means yes."
"And they have it too."
"I'm going to be okay."
"My dad is hiding here."
"The reason to cover Africa."
"Fifth time's the charm."
"So they think we have lice."
"You need an evening dress."
"I'm about to throw up."
"Please wait a minute."
"Someone who is not looking for jewelry."
"I had a little luck."
"I think you already know each other."
"Tell me how they brought you here."
"I understand all that, you know."
"Well, good luck to both of you."
"I send you good wines."
"It seems that he likes you."
"I hope you enjoy your stay."
"It will be good for them to do business."
"Finish your law studies."
"Your planet is very bright."
"This will only take a minute."
"Oh my God, that's amazing."
"He lives in his own world."
"Which is saying a lot."
"That's a good boy."
"You know I feel good."
"I'll put it on the list."
"Wait, I'll give it to you."
"Mine and yours."
"On the battlefield."
"It's a matter of trust."
"Take your money and go."
"I also went out in my underwear."
"You have something that is mine."
"They work in munitions, they are essential."
"I brought you breakfast."
"For a job well done."
"For each other."
"She wouldn't want it that way."
"It is a very common name."
"A couple of nights ago."
"He has been brainwashed."
"Thanks, but we have to go."
"Now we're waiting for you."
"I think I've seen it."
"You don't know anything about this."
"I don't know that guy."
"And we will eat them."
"I thought you had retired."
"It's all I have."
"Red ink on pink paper."
"What an interesting job you have."
"I believe in people."
"You better stay close to me."
"They had a press conference."
"Only two shots were heard."
"I'll tell you what happens."
"Your father is at home."
"I have a reputation to protect."
"It's your Christmas present."
"I'll let him go in peace."
"I've heard that many times."
"I knew about you before."
"Go the other way."
"He'll be back pretty good, you'll see."
"Because now I have one of my own."
"Get me the White House."
"I swear on your life."
"It was a sign from God."
"Let him stay here."
"Our King in the North."
"But it is that way."
"What is the building, sir?"
"The Three Laws are perfect."
"I think I understand my place."
"I know it in my heart."
"Pack your bags immediately."
"We'll see each other at dinner."
"They even had traces from the steering wheel."
"All right, let's eat."
"I think it is true."
"I'm sorry about dinner."
"It is a very precise work."
"I just have a few more questions."
"When he doesn't pay, they cut him off."
"The position has been filled."
"But you said there was."
"But I want to tell you one thing."
"The Alpha is very fast."
"I am the school's janitor."
"What we have to do."
"This is about my son."
"Leave a safety item."
"You did it behind my back."
"Your life is waiting for you."
"But the month will pass quickly."
"Let the boy advance."
"I'm on my way home."
"I think I always knew."
"Let the boy try."
"In search of the truth."
"Yes, I'll keep that in mind."
"Let's talk to her."
"We are talking about a machine."
"How am I not myself?"
"A ride in the car."
"I took a vow of peace."
"They come through the west gate."
"You've had enough kisses."
"That's always a good sign."
"If the war ends."
"All right, I'm leaving now."
"Look, I'll show you how."
"You look very pretty tonight."
"But I feel much better."
"I have to take the bus."
"This is the good part."
"And my answer is yes."
"Please lower your voice."
"I want to be liked."
"It's a question of money."
"I was born to be a mother."
"In plain sight."
"Look what a beautiful daughter I have."
"And you're going to be okay."
"Nice doing business with you."
"Give me the accommodation permit."
"I thought I was stronger."
"I loved talking to you."
"It's a text message."
"The prince of the city."
"Everything stopped working, Mr."
"Come see me sometime."
"As far away as I can."
"Now we're going home."
"I have never seen a miracle."
"He wants to work at the clinic."
"I think we all are."
"I haven't seen him lately."
"You can pick up your merchandise personally."
"I can do a little more."
"You are a very clever young man."
"That's how I want it."
"Only a couple of times."
"It's actually a classic thing."
"That's all for today."
"I thought with a friend."
"Floating through a blue sky."
"I was going to marry her."
"Sorry, I thought I heard something."
"Each one is as he is."
"You have to come find me."
"The bus is waiting for them."
"This is a perfect opportunity."
"I have a job at a bank."
"People are going to talk."
"Anything you can imagine."
"Two men and a woman."
"I have to do some shopping."
"It's time to do something."
"I want to protect him from people like that."
"It will remain between you and me."
"That's what we agreed on."
"I think he's trying to tell me something."
"I would never do that to him."
"She is a very intelligent woman."
"One step back, please."
"Tomorrow is an important day."
"The volume is on the side."
"I have a dog too."
"There are all kinds of things."
"Now we need his."
"You could have helped me convince him."
"Then I have nothing left."
"Return to your men alive."
"You knew it from the beginning."
"I need to know about the girl."
"She was my first love."
"I'll call you when I need you."
"The salt of the earth."
"He's kind of right."
"A couple more minutes."
"But I learned an important lesson."
"Tell me more, please teach me."
"But Moses works in metals."
"Everything works perfectly."
"I must speak to the senators."
"In every way I can."
"We have to take you home."
"A couple of times, yes."
"My mind is blank."
"It's there, in your pocket."
"Do with me your will."
"It looks like someone is flying."
"You better get moving."
"They can't track him."
"Ten cents is the minimum."
"I love kindergarten."
"I'm staying with her."
"Ten can't do anything."
"I want to tell you my secret now."
"Tell me you have the glasses."
"I'm proud of you, cowboy."
"See what awaits you."
"Yes, of course I'm fine."
"My last bodyguard left."
"The word has spread."
"Someone is creating an army."
"I think that's good."
"That will have to do."
"Please let me work here."
"That's what we want to find out."
"You are all my reasons."
"I said I could be here."
"The taste of the first kiss."
"You're going to look for him again."
"Bringing the cotton bales."
"We must find that woman."
"Do you think we should be here?"
"You are a stone queen."
"I can't deal with this."
"You have to make an effort."
"I have one of those faces."
"Wait for the storm to pass."
"We're just taking a look."
"And it's a happy day."
"If the jacket fits you."
"Hey, look at my face."
"I'm going for a drink."
"You are a very good boy."
"And that's how things are."
"The agency thing is yours."
"Now to the other side."
"You'll have to wait and see."
"And that's saying a lot."
"Because I wanted to be a man."
"Here and everywhere."
"Now look at the tip."
"We get you the best hotels."
"At least he's sincere."
"How good you are to come."
"But I do know one thing."
"Each in his own way."
"It's the Year of the Scorpion."
"We have a lot of things to buy."
"But that's how it's always been."
"The Bermuda Triangle."
"Clearer than water."
"Like the rest of the country."
"Your children still love you."
"You look prettier than ever."
"I am the Swan Queen."
"Just tell me why."
"Come in, welcome to my house."
"It had better be that way."
"Laugh all you want."
"This is your big night."
"I think I'm ready now."
"He knows what he needs to know."
"You've been very good today."
"Talent skips a generation."
"Well, the second best invention."
"I don't make the laws."
"Honey, it comes from my heart."
"This court is in session."
"I don't like men."
"Thank you so much for leaving me behind."
"Because he is right."
"I just want to talk to them."
"That's exactly what I'll do."
"It's the middle of the day."
"From the security office."
"God, send me your love soon."
"You agree with him."
"We had to order this one."
"A handsome guy, I'm sure."
"They want to be a Family again."
"It must be brought to the ship."
"It's actually quite nice."
"I just came for my things."
"Tuesday night."
"He was just a kid, dude."
"I'm glad to see you're reasonable."
"As fast as a leopard."
"We look through them."
"I already told you yes."
"She has seen it all."
"I need a couple of hours."
"Sure, of course."
"The children were waiting for you."
"What is the girl's name?"
"Now I do my homework."
"Last questions, please."
"Your Majesty is very kind."
"The one who never shuts up."
"Sorry about the door."
"And to all his family."
"I'm speeding."
"So she's fine."
"It's all in the book."
"I have complete confidence in you."
"It must have been tough."
"Let them do their job."
"All bets are off."
"Single-parent family."
"It was a spur of the moment thing."
"You will be my only defense."
"I'll fix it soon."
"Oh, darling, how talented you are."
"Tell him to choose another profession."
"They don't know what detonator he uses."
"They've been doing it for years."
"I went last month."
"Let's give them time together."
"You slept with that actress."
"I owe you all."
"Don't come if you don't want to."
"He's a good shot, sir."
"They probably know it's here."
"He's going to settle down."
"I think it's good that we talk."
"A big and happy family."
"I'll do what I please."
"Let's find higher ground."
"I think I already knew that."
"You think we shouldn't have come."
"You'll do it anyway."
"Even with my own daughter."
"You already did it once."
"One more question, please."
"Someone shot him while he was sleeping."
"My last dance place."
"We should ask your mother."
"I may not survive."
"Just my coworkers."
"I can get the necessary signatures."
"Yes, that's life."
"I think he is interesting."
"Give me the bat and go."
"I have to take him home."
"That man was my father."
"The house specialty."
"U.S. Embassy"
"It is very different from power."
"Open your eyes and look at me."
"Next time I will."
"You're not safe there."
"Let's see how you do it."
"That's easy to fix."
"So it's nobody's."
"Three minutes until they arrive."
"Hurry up and take the fingerprints."
"It's half past six."
"I'm going to call right now."
"And so am I."
"It was a real pleasure meeting you."
"I remember when I gave this to you."
"It's the best for you."
"And we'll talk about your future."
"I want you to see one thing."
"I say what I see."
"Tell me what my job will be."
"So get in the car."
"I want to meet your friends."
"I will find solace elsewhere."
"The people are my son."
"It's my home, really."
"I'll see you there later."
"He carried it in his pocket."
"I think we're going in."
"It's a very good cape."
"Permission to speak freely, sir."
"The house was the barracks."
"But my intentions were good."
"Many men have tried it."
"In the usual place."
"The last shall be first."
"Maybe it was safer outside."
"Leave your coats wherever."
"You are in a very good mood."
"The back door will be open."
"I can show you how safe it is."
"My God, how you've grown."
"This was the last time."
"On with the traveling feast."
"I've been working with him."
"Your hair looks good."
"Surely there is an explanation."
"I would like to talk to my brother."
"We were at a party together."
"Put it there with the others."
"He wants you to control his room."
"Because, bro, we need this car."
"You said they were looking for you."
"You have to catch up."
"And to all humanity."
"Covers county news."
"I had to go inside to find out."
"Please, please, listen to me."
"Your mom is very kind."
"Calm down boy and stay still."
"Whatever you want, it's yours."
"You are the only one who can."
"My wife mentioned your name."
"They use an air gun."
"Yes, this has changed a lot."
"I don't know what that was."
"That's exactly what it's all about."
"This may be a clue."
"I've done it again."
"We can take care of ourselves."
"He is my son too."
"I love that about you."
"Let me talk to you for a second."
"I need to speak to the police."
"I buried her in the basement."
"A customer is always right."
"The following is very important."
"They have a very nice house."
"Ready when you are."
"I was having a good dream."
"Because no one will believe you later."
"You have opened my eyes."
"Good luck with retirement."
"I hope that's not it."
"A dollar here, another there."
"And they get along very well."
"Your friend in Time."
"They were all front wives."
"You said you wanted to see me."
"It's a habit I have."
"Everyone needs it."
"Let your head answer."
"There is a lot of time between stops."
"Because I'm in love with him."
"Much has changed since then."
"I wonder if it's true."
"Don't come here anymore."
"Business may improve."
"Back to where we started."
"I'll be right back with the key."
"Be an Onion Knight."
"To this day."
"That's how they get you."
"Your father didn't have this."
"Let's say we're working on it."
"A true work of art."
"We make a very good team."
"I just said what I think."
"I'll see you in a little while."
"Let me tell you what I know."
"You must get up from the table."
"The war will continue here tomorrow."
"Yes, about a year ago."
"I didn't do it, I swear."
"Or maybe I'm just embarrassed."
"He's still in the house."
"That's just the beginning."
"The source of my power."
"That's the secret word."
"For serving our country."
"They know that I love them."
"But strong as a bull."
"Better not be."
"It sounds like a spy story."
"Have a happy day."
"Take this to the witch."
"The shot will come out from behind."
"I'll pick you up at the airport."
"Let them sleep one more hour."
"Jesus, God is the same."
"And I decided to give it to you myself."
"I love you too, Major."
"Yes, we have noticed."
"I want you to talk to her."
"Child is the safe."
"I asked him to come today."
"You're going to pay for that."
"Tell him what the key is."
"I can't think about him."
"You have to go with him."
"God is in the rain."
"But it's Christmas Eve."
"I didn't know anything about him."
"I think there's something here."
"Please get out of the water."
"I don't like that at all."
"This is getting better."
"This is a private room."
"The boy who was here."
"Naturally I learned from the best."
"All civil agents or interests."
"Tell him not to do it."
"I was glad you called."
"And a cup of tea."
"He is eager to practice."
"As his friends love him."
"They are defending this entire area."
"More self-confident."
"That's where I play."
"Here's what you asked for."
"All right, I'm on my way."
"His father's character."
"I need to go to the library."
"I knew you were going to laugh."
"It happens in the best of families."
"It's what you always do."
"I am fireproof."
"They really love this place."
"Well, time's up."
"I've been thinking about it a lot."
"Darling, I really can't talk."
"The witness will answer the question."
"All that is behind us."
"Before you go."
"Twenty, and you're nineteen."
"Your business is your business."
"It fools even the experts."
"It is written in the stars."
"The rules are the same."
"It's supposed to be me."
"I've always wanted one of these."
"They are very easy to follow."
"This is what love should feel like."
"The last of the village."
"I'll make him believe, you understand?"
"We have to go shopping."
"It's better than a table."
"I'm going to use the bathroom."
"So it's very important."
"A friend from college."
"Go, I'll carry the luggage."
"Mine never did."
"I'm going to make that call."
"He will be called the son of God."
"The Cube is pure energy."
"I didn't expect him to stay."
"I'm about to find out."
"Well, from time to time."
"There's a letter for you."
"This is our famous maze."
"It's someone in my newsroom."
"I've been here all day."
"Because they won't understand."
"Your reward is your life."
"Look under the table."
"That's just what I saw."
"I know it very well."
"I came as soon as possible."
"But you haven't been there."
"It was a pleasure for me."
"And fighting for his kingdom."
"I had it a minute ago."
"Glad to have you back."
"I'll be fine soon."
"Not this weekend."
"Just watch your corner."
"You were on the bus."
"And many movie stars."
"Good luck on the test."
"I don't know about technology."
"Talk outside this hall."
"Yes, he is my best friend."
"I'll give you a special price."
"These guys are passing by here."
"I hope you get well."
"We should talk about his rehabilitation."
"Before making a decision."
"You have to choose one."
"But that's what he wanted."
"It is a lake, public property."
"They said you were gone."
"He is one of the crew."
"It's always about them."
"I hope nothing happens."
"I'm sorry about this too."
"You made a good investment, gentlemen."
"We must remain calm."
"That's how it is every day."
"We must maintain the electric field."
"I would love to have dinner with you."
"Although not for long."
"Let there be two, please."
"I don't think that's right."
"Take the rest of the team."
"I don't want them to do it."
"I plan to see it through."
"Because she is too."
"Sorry for coming so late."
"All right, I'll send someone."
"Please tell me your name."
"My mother is doing very well."
"Your father looks well."
"Four tones, they are not there."
"You said you'd never leave."
"He wants her to call him."
"I have to see her again."
"You always get what you want."
"Thank you very much for your support."
"I understand that it is a lot of money."
"But I'm going to be okay."
"Now we are real sisters."
"There is an explanation for this."
"There's no arguing with you."
"I'm sure you don't know."
"You already know how it is."
"This is front page news."
"The ship is moving."
"But he made her go away."
"It is a labyrinth of tunnels."
"Like the sail of the ship."
"It is activated by sound."
"We will go through the entrance together."
"Nobody saw or heard anything."
"There has to be another option."
"It was the first thing we knew."
"You've been so good to me."
"I think it's the best."
"Like a million times."
"I have a lot of trust in you, friends."
"I haven't heard your name."
"The eagle and the scroll."
"You can't be reasoned with."
"Then I'll see you tonight."
"I wanted to send you especially."
"There is a way to do it."
"You will always be safe with me."
"I have to work on that."
"I think I'm leaving now."
"It has to be a surprise."
"She's wearing a very light coat."
"I'm helping you with something."
"It's not part of the deal."
"Oh yes, on this ship."
"From one of the moons."
"There is still much to see."
"I have a knack for numbers."
"The roof, on the other side."
"I've told you everything."
"I just got out of there."
"And he's a good father."
"Men are not prepared."
"To black and white."
"Well, I've come many times."
"Don't tell me yes."
"Much of a muchness."
"You are a very handsome boy."
"And it's in your house."
"That's why I trust it."
"Now you're on your own."
"Please let me come back later."
"I'm going to take you outside."
"Whatever you have."
"It will be there in four minutes."
"Give your best."
"It's like a huge clock."
"I think this is mine."
"There are traps everywhere."
"We must open all the curtains."
"I have a very important meeting."
"I do it because I like it."
"Please, after you."
"They put him in the trunk."
"That's a great framework."
"And an apple jam."
"They have a major league team."
"I told her."
"You want your country back."
"I had to apply the formula."
"God, I love that car."
"This one has a classic engine."
"I want to show you the real Sicily."
"Please, orange juice."
"He married another woman."
"So you're Spider-Man."
"You're doing really well."
"You must be the gardener."
"I'll take care of the dragon."
"Still, I consider myself lucky."
"Well, it's a special night."
"To be by your side."
"I didn't hear that part."
"My husband was a teacher there."
"Remember your hostess duties."
"It looks good to me."
"He took all my pay."
"It will take at least three weeks."
"That's a good argument."
"It's a car that jumps."
"You didn't just say that."
"Before going to the boat."
"Our neighbor is an artist."
"I need to talk to you, sir."
"You are a better person than me."
"I wrote it many years later."
"Of course not me."
"The man was a genius."
"He wants me to go with him."
"I have passed all the tests."
"Then I tried to give them money."
"And you the great Psychopath."
"Please live a little."
"I want to do something about it."
"See you tonight, honey."
"You are violating the Three Laws."
"The voice of wisdom."
"You already did yours."
"What he says makes sense."
"Welcome to the second test."
"You should be grateful for that."
"I'm going to be fine."
"I can say whatever I want."
"Hey, be careful with the suit."
"I saw it in my head."
"I understand what you're saying."
"I'll be passing through town tomorrow."
"So I saw it all."
"It's the last thing we need."
"What do they give you to eat?"
"For God's sake, of course."
"I like being with her."
"The spy knows the truth."
"You better do something."
"Take the cows to the stable."
"He was speeding."
"I have to write to the King."
"Sir, I need to talk to you."
"It's on the first floor."
"That goes for all of you."
"I think it just arrived."
"I work for your dad."
"They are the men we want."
"You are good with words."
"We could throw an awesome party."
"I stay up late."
"Give this to your mom."
"Yes, you are a true hero."
"For my modeling photos."
"That's good for us."
"Let me talk to my boss."
"A telegram just arrived."
"It depends on who takes it."
"This must end."
"You've been a good friend."
"You think you know a story."
"They got there before me."
"This has to end here."
"Go home, immediately."
"Leave it, until everything passes."
"It's good, even if it's mine."
"A brother is a brother."
"There will always be one."
"The kidnapper was bigger."
"The one who looks like a priest."
"You've heard about this."
"And things like that."
"This is a respectable house."
"But I love sports."
"For ghosts, it's spells."
"I already know what it's called."
"The dams pass through here."
"It's very nice here."
"You're fooling yourself."
"It's under the bed."
"Pay attention next time."
"I'm going to correct the trajectory."
"My father's watch."
"I would like to talk to my daughter."
"That's why I love him more."
"Today I want to do something different."
"I have betrayed my wife."
"So we created our own."
"There seems to be a family resemblance."
"There are things we can do."
"It's just that I have a lot of work."
"Look, I brought you a gift."
"How beautiful love is."
"They just dress better."
"Sorry, I had to do it."
"Of course, whatever."
"It's what I live for."
"The tone is very high."
"My stomach is making noise."
"But not that way."
"Well, thanks for the ride."
"This is where I saw her."
"It's going to be an adventure."
"I'm going to the bathroom for a moment."
"I liked the one before."
"You go, I'll stay."
"But I have other virtues, father."
"I read a lot of history books."
"They are not monsters, they are animals."
"That you liked her boyfriend."
"There's nothing out there."
"It could be a first step."
"I'll come back to check on you."
"That's what they say anyway."
"But we can only do one."
"One nail drives out another."
"You have a family to protect."
"All right, it's my turn."
"The children at nine."
"Now he seems to be doing very well."
"I am proud to be Irish."
"My God, I hope not."
"See you at three."
"People always say that."
"It's half past five."
"It is a very good store."
"Thanks for keeping up to date."
"I checked that room myself."
"Sex or car theft."
"But he didn't know."
"And the rest is history."
"We will have a great time together."
"Plants, animals, people, fungi, viruses."
"Everyone knows who I'm talking about."
"Welcome to the USA"
"It has been a wonderful afternoon."
"A solution must be found."
"I'm going to live in it."
"I'm not that guy anymore."
"I will have it at your disposal."
"We are in the middle of the forest."
"I will keep it as a treasure."
"This is a pleasant surprise."
"My heart is leaping out."
"I'm sorry about your broom."
"He has a satellite phone."
"See you on the plane."
"I have a family too."
"He was a peaceful man."
"This was what was missing."
"They have a bigger antenna."
"Well, I'll tell you one thing."
"I'm really looking forward to seeing it."
"I'm sorry you see it that way."
"It's out of your jurisdiction."
"He doesn't even know he's gone."
"They are at the main door."
"Let's start again from the beginning."
"She needs to get her priorities straight."
"That's what we'll say."
"Leave this to the professionals."
"Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"I was so looking forward to seeing you."
"I hope this phone line helps."
"He's not going to care."
"One sugar, please."
"It's all we want."
"It must be the hormones."
"Oh yeah, I remember now."
"All right, I'll tell you something."
"Since you brought that tape."
"Sorry, everything is fine."
"My sex life is fine."
"The Archbishop has powerful friends."
"Like with the other guy."
"The sergeant has copied it."
"It's on line one."
"If you please, sir."
"I'm going to find those stairs."
"I am older than you."
"I hope you're the Groom."
"Let's have tea."
"The clever and brave survive."
"They are returning to the jungle."
"I think I found a way out."
"I saw one of them."
"It's music to my ears."
"White Swan, you're in ten."
"They are always the quietest."
"Nice to see you, buddy."
"Skiing here must be fantastic."
"I'll take you home soon."
"My son is a king."
"I was waiting for you for an hour."
"Now let's go to the tavern."
"Give me something for the Prosecutor."
"At one o'clock sharp."
"Yes, it's me again."
"Search the entire yacht."
"I have to close the door."
"I always knew it would be like this."
"A fundraiser with my friends."
"Let's just rehearse."
"I have you here with me, darling."
"Greatness is a vision."
"Congratulations on having a job."
"It's your brother's business."
"It is a form of liberation."
"It's a graduation gift."
"There is something next to the tree."
"I have to go, dad."
"So, I'll see you tonight."
"Give him some air."
"I said I was considering it."
"I will put these flowers in water."
"The table calls, however."
"It's so easy to talk to you."
"I must return to court."
"You're going to have to choose."
"You have to let me do this."
"Okay, so we're in agreement."
"They will return for the final battle."
"Can I leave it with you?"
"They're everywhere, Chief."
"Of course they did."
"This is all open country."
"Well, now the second step."
"We're all going to be okay."
"I hope you heard that."
"I only have two photos left."
"I have written him a letter."
"At the bottom of the stairs."
"I told you a thousand times."
"That situation was somewhat different."
"Nobody asked you to."
"I want to be sure of this."
"I want to talk to them personally."
"I just ordered some drinks."
"A man with the Beast."
"That's exactly what we'll do."
"All the time you need."
"I bet he would."
"It's from everyone."
"You are my best man."
"Can you get to the accident?"
"At half past eight."
"I think you shouldn't do it."
"These are his last words."
"But you didn't do it."
"Because they want to know the truth."
"Whatever I have to do."
"I want to go back to bed."
"We need you more than ever."
"Send the rescue bird."
"I can't, I have to work."
"We are a big happy family."
"Romantic friends do this."
"But I have you."
"Let's go to the middle of the room."
"I need to talk to him now."
"I want to be part of that."
"How nice to be home."
"They'll throw you to the lions."
"You have to move your feet."
"I thought I wanted to be a singer."
"Let them do what they want."
"There's much more to it than that."
"So we don't have much time."
"I am a happily married man."
"And we have a curfew."
"Change is what I'm looking for."
"We agree on something."
"You don't know those people."
"But I think you're right."
"You said it, sir."
"I'm from the telephone company."
"I'll be back tomorrow night."
"There's something about those trees."
"I think she loved you."
"Spider-Man was there."
"But it works like clockwork."
"But I'll talk to my boss."
"I need someone outside of Homicide."
"You were right about her."
"That was the whole point."
"I met her a long time ago."
"Whatever makes you happy."
"But these are special circumstances."
"I'm going away for a while."
"Is there something you want to tell me?"
"They think it was me."
"I'll have a cup of tea."
"I've been covering it for nine years."
"The Children of the Earth."
"Sixty-five percent."
"Then I give you my blessing."
"I can name more than three."
"Well, I'll do what I can."
"Your lucky backpack."
"The truth is, I'm fine here."
"Sooner than I thought."
"I have news for you, my friend."
"I will stay by your side."
"I could tear you to pieces with them."
"Go warm up."
"You look like you need a drink."
"I want to go with my mom."
"What you have to see."
"I can only think about it."
"Put your leg over."
"Then I'll have to close the curtains."
"I think you should go now."
"The love of your life."
"I can attest to that."
"That you want your own Family."
"I can't do that anymore."
"Show me the way home."
"At the bus station."
"They're going to tear us apart."
"Maybe he didn't even know about the money."
"And I realize my dream."
"God is in the details."
"It was all I needed."
"I bet you'd like it."
"But let me do it."
"This man is a patient."
"I'm happy for you, sister."
"You taught him his lesson, comrade."
"I think I was pretty clear."
"For asking that it not be left out."
"I'll tell you what I am."
"And this is the result."
"Well, let's see this."
"I got paid well both times."
"I always liked this area."
"That's a long story."
"Downtown, shopping."
"I think we've done it."
"You are a very attractive man."
"You have to get us out of here."
"It will only be for a while."
"It's like being home."
"Tell me what you want me to say."
"You must bring me something in return."
"Of course I agree."
"I'm going to give birth."
"That's close by."
"You're a bookworm."
"I'm going to do an interview."
"I'm ready to make coffee."
"Let them stay on hold."
"Don't drag them into this."
"I need you to come today."
"The perfect circle of protection."
"Tell me what it's about."
"I wish he would."
"I'm having a wonderful time."
"And you're next."
"Nobody has time for that."
"I didn't think much about it."
"Which is very wise."
"I always wanted to do the right thing."
"We'll see in the morning."
"I hope he doesn't."
"A gift from your navy."
"Maybe I can get a girlfriend."
"But they are not his."
"The Vatican administrator disappeared."
"I came to talk to you, darling."
"I'll give him a good name."
"Please don't look at them."
"I have to get in shape."
"The boy attacked the prince."
"She is our only hope."
"That's right, the gardener."
"They always marry cousins."
"And I'm impressed by the result."
"I always believed in those things."
"Love is love."
"I'm curious about your owner."
"You have to sign the receipt."
"Now it's behind yours."
"You said that an hour ago."
"Look, I'll call you later."
"I was thinking about my mother."
"You never met my brother."
"In Paris, he has seen houses."
"Dad, I need to talk to you."
"We have to go this way."
"Of course I've seen it."
"And this is an order."
"Please, a little more."
"It is a very big city."
"Why did you open the curtains?"
"And yet they still want to go?"
"Thank you for traveling with us."
"But I kept thinking about you."
"Put something in his mouth."
"Get down from the tree right now."
"Sure, honey, everything's fine."
"I'll show you what I have."
"I really wish so."
"He decided his own fate."
"Son, listen to me very carefully."
"They both want that job."
"Your heart is broken, hurt."
"I don't think that matters."
"I have to have it by tomorrow."
"Not a good start."
"At least for tonight."
"We are telling you the truth."
"To meet up with the others."

"And now his watch is over."
"Then we moved into that building."
"I asked you not to do it."
"It's the best way to learn."
"That's a nice way of putting it."
"The captain is on the bridge."
"You see, when something happens, traces are left behind."
"I'll take it to the grave."
"Until we meet again."
"I'll get it back to you in an hour."
"There is always a goal, a target."
"Now the ring brought him here."
"The keys are in my coat."
"The things we do for love."
"He said he'd call you when he's done."
"Look, that was a long time ago."
"With your hands in the dough."
"I'm so proud of you, son."
"Let me go and I'll fix it for you."
"In the morning he will be as good as new."
"Because we wouldn't have had this conversation."
"Faster, easier, more seductive."
"First find out where the chain is."
"You're right, you're absolutely right."
"Sorry, my answer is endless."
"It's a great opportunity for you."
"Put your legs on the bed."
"A table for two, please."
"You're the only family I have."
"I have to work in the morning."
"Come and sit next to me."
"You're far from your neighborhood, friend."
"And at that meeting you will be killed."
"The chosen one may be the child."
"I recommend a travel agent."
"I'll call you as soon as I know something."
"You said you were a man of your word."
"I think she likes it."
"I'll come back when your daughter is better."
"You and I look a lot alike."
"Put that bag on the ground."
"These are the staff quarters."
"I'm sorry, but orders are orders."
"I'll ask you one last time."
"Okay, go talk to him."
"A whiskey with ice and water."
"You two have a lot in common."
"The girls and bunnies are calling."
"They must not know what he did."
"Ring the bells in one hour."
"I was until a little while ago."
"You're going to wake up the neighbors."
"What a way to end a friendship."
"I haven't seen her for years."
"I had lunch today with the Three Wise Men."
"I mean that in a good way."
"You must be careful with women."
"That's what he's doing."
"Talk to her and you'll see."
"Then it blew itself up, right here."
"I have passes to the best rooms."
"I don't think we have much time."
"My daughters bring water from the river."
"You're going to need all your faith."
"But not because you didn't know it."
"I think it's time for me to go."
"Speak now or forever hold your peace."
"I have a son your age."
"A great day awaits you tomorrow."
"I'll tell you when I see you."
"I should write a little earlier."
"There's something to it."
"Let's hope it's for the last time."
"As soon as possible, please."
"You have to be with your mother."
"A dinner at the White House."
"Find out who's trying to bury him."
"That's exactly what we were talking about, that happens."
"I have to go to the station."
"But this is what we do."
"See you in a week."
"We have to open all the curtains."
"Whatever, whatever."
"Please leave your message after the tone."
"That's very clever of you."
"We're going to have to do something."
"Everything will be okay, son."
"It's seven in the morning."
"Let's see what you think about this."
"Well, have a nice day."
"I've seen what you can do."
"I have to talk to my father."
"I need a couple more days."
"I have to find my daughter."
"Do exactly what I tell you."
"I'll give you my phone number."
"If you don't mind me asking."
"It's the only thing you can do."
"There's something else I must tell you."
"Let's get you to bed."
"But now things have changed."
"I am the Iron Patriot."
"I have something very important to do."
"She buried him the next morning."
"This part of the river belongs to us."
"I'll tell you everything later."
"There's something I want you to know."
"Anything is better than this."
"Now you will feel something cold and wet."
"That's all I can give you."
"The truth is that I'm fine."
"I am the master of the stairs."
"Your father is a good man."
"And the year of joy."
"I appreciate you coming so early."
"I think we'll be fine here, Leon."
"I think about that every day."
"To one side, to one side."
"He owns this place."
"I told you it was going to work."
"It seems like a long time ago."
"I knew it would come sooner or later."
"Well, the moment of truth."
"But always through glass."
"You were very kind to me once."
"Just the man I was looking for."
"I thought you were an expert."
"I know everything I need to know."
"Let's see if I understand this."
"I had to see you one more time."
"These things don't happen today."
"I have a patient in the neighborhood."
"Let me talk to our mutual friend."
"It's one of my favorite movies."
"It's one in the morning."
"Thank God he came."
"Down the hall, to the right."
"And his father is the bellboy."
"This is what I'm thinking."
"The woman in the drawing is me."
"I'm glad to see you're okay."
"Your dinner is in the oven."
"He's never looked so good."
"It's a welcome, it's a welcome."
"I never met my parents."
"I didn't ask him to do it."
"All the lights are green."
"Do what you are told."
"As I told you, we had plenty of time."
"You can do whatever you like."
"I have to talk to my wife."
"Have your things taken to the apartment."
"The doctors never found the cure."
"Across the bay."
"It goes against my religion."
"That's all he talks about."
"One more kiss and I'm up."
"Look, everything is going to be okay."
"You don't know him, but he's got guts."
"I'm glad you decided to come."
"Everyone knows why they are here."
"It's not going to come to that."
"You were the first to enter."
"And I have to live with that."
"The last cage on the right."
"I'm going to call your mother."
"I understand what you're going through."
"I think it's in the bathroom."
"I don't need to hear any 'yes'."
"You can't even imagine it."
"Let's say he arrives home."
"Stay here, where I can see you."
"I have an appointment with a client."
"To the people I trust."
"They were always very kind to us."
"You've never been with a woman."
"I have read a lot about them."
"The 'you and me' is over."
"Take whatever you want and that's it."
"Your brother did his job well."
"In hard times, he found a lot of money."
"Come here and give me a hug."
"When the time comes, you'll know."
"I never thought about what it meant."
"Imagine the rest of eternity."
"Of course you're not."
"Go see the children."
"Please be careful with the drawings."
"I swear to you by my daughters."
"This is a work of art."
"There are all colors and flavors."
"I don't owe anything to anyone."
"The police will arrive any moment."
"Stay and work at home."
"Let's go back to the kitchen."
"I thought you were going to be calm."
"Today is your big day, my friend."
"Today for you, tomorrow for me."
"I've been up all night."
"Be all you can be."
"That is the destiny of man."
"Here are the cans of preserves."
"Go calm your friend down."
"I told you before noon."
"But you have to go with them."
"This is going to get interesting."
"And in the end this is love."
"It was for your own good, believe me."
"Thank God, thank God."
"You can have everything you want."
"Go to sleep and we'll see tomorrow."
"It will arrive in less than an hour."
"It has been a pleasure working with you."
"She is a family friend."
"I'd better take a look."
"Take your feet off the table."
"And they will give you more than one."
"I'll go around back."
"Welcome to my summer palace."
"Looks like I arrived just in time."
"I thought you'd already left."
"Rome greets its new emperor."
"We have many memories in this car."
"The ships were looking for you for weeks."
"You weren't even in the country."
"So they think we're here."
"I saw you downtown today."
"He has my gratitude for that."
"Let's do what we have to do."
"I want him out of my house."
"I see you're wearing a brooch there."
"In health and sickness."
"I've already told you about him."
"And what does that have to do with it?"
"You're going to love this place."
"If you're sure you want to do it."
"The thing here is fast, fast."
"There are two more vehicles over there."
"You seem to have gained weight."
"You create the dream world."
"I told you I was coming."
"Go to an ally's house."
"I have a good ear for that too."
"I would have taken you somewhere else."
"For the good of both of us."
"It's a big step for me."
"The age of the elves is over."
"With his finger on the trigger."
"I'll just keep sucking on coconut and crab."
"Not that it matters, but yes."
"I was about to find that out."
"Look what he's done to you."
"I'm so glad you like it."
"Don't think about the girl."
"Our last night on the island."
"The stones are inside me."
"I would love to, but I have to work."
"We will send you to the treatment center."
"He has the birthright."
"The receipt is in the bag."
"What is to be, will be."
"I have to go to the kitchen."
"Some days are better than others."
"They are prettier than people."
"All I see is red."
"I called you a million times."
"At six in the morning."
"There is a child in the cage."
"He is a proven battle commander."
"The wind is still blowing from the west."
"From the bottom of the throat."
"I knew you were going to be here."
"How good, how good, how good."
"I'll see you early in the morning."
"I have a little task for you."
"It's my first day at work."
"The guardians of the sacred words."
"Good to see you again, son."
"Until the end of days."
"You look so much like your mother."
"Have a wonderful time."
"It's on the roof of the elevator."
"I'm the one who pays the fare."
"You need time to mature a little."
"I have to get back to the city."
"I'll have to call you later."
"Lord, he was about to discover everything."
"They went for their flock this morning."
"Old tricks are the best."
"I brought you a welcome gift."
"I can't answer that question."
"Love is worth saving."
"Let's do it one more time."
"There's something I don't like."
"It is not good for your health."
"Wow, it's a small world."
"A point has been taken away."
"He said he already has one."
"I came here to give you this."
"I have you right where I want you."
"A girl should live at home."
"Many creatures here know him."
"We've known each other our whole lives."
"I put the diamond in the coat."
"The keys are in the car."
"I guess I put on a good show."
"But you already know which one it is."
"There's the man of the moment."
"Notice how useful each one is."
"Your father is a great man."
"Human protection protocol activated."
"I've told you many times."
"I still can't think of anything."
"It's a long way down."
"This is called 'roll change'."
"Because you and I are angels."
"Looks like it's going to be you."
"I had a horse once."
"Yes, of course he did."
"We'll have to do something about it."
"This just keeps getting better."
"I know you're a busy man."
"And this is how it's done."
"That's all the time we have."
"Business before pleasure."
"Don't talk if you're not talked to."
"All arrangements have been made."
"Just the jerk I want to see."
"I don't think we should be here."
"To bear witness to the truth."
"We have to play with more bullets."
"Give me a cigarette and I'll tell you."
"Yes, that's what it is."
"I'm going to take you off the case."
"I'm just Mr. Rabbit."
"Freedom is the only way."
"I know you are a good man."
"To infinity and beyond."
"From your perspective, you are a man."
"My parents live across the street."
"And he became like a beast."
"Not in a paper cup."
"It seems like forever ago."
"I'm so happy when you dance with me."
"It's the most I can do."
"I was going to move on to ice cream."
"Gentlemen, welcome to your new home."
"It will make you dance to its rhythm."
"Enough with the music, friends."
"Please return to your room."
"On this side or the other."
"Imagine you are running with him."
"Welcome to the world of the living."
"I read about you in the newspapers."
"It's always better on vacation."
"This is what she wants."
"The Dutchman is under my command."
"That's all you need to do."
"I demand that you leave immediately."
"Prepare the ground for the interview."
"I saw him a couple of times."
"Let's get into character."
"I have a girl who overdosed."
"It's different, but just as good."
"It is the head of a man."
"You are part of a new beginning."
"My name is on the building."
"I'd better go and see."
"In this market the seller rules."
"But now I'm back home."
"So you can see how kind I am."
"But rules are rules."
"That's what we really are."
"Just a technician doing his job."
"Well, I'd like to talk to you."
"I've gone too far."
"Son, I take care of mine."
"I don't think we have any other choice."
"I already told you I don't know."
"The moment of truth has arrived."
"Heaven is earned with patience."
"They have to be somewhere."
"If you're going to do it, do it right."
"I told you I don't know anything."
"But maybe it's just old age."
"Time to go to school."
"A bit like with women."
"I knew I belonged in that world."
"We'll also take some with us."
"I'm going to get my son."
"The doctors give him six months."
"I'm going to tell you who I am."
"Just one more tail feather."
"On a very, very clear day."
"I know what I have to tell you."
"Thank you for your vote of confidence."
"I have to go to the police station."
"You'll never find it here."
"You shouldn't read at the table."
"I have a bullet in my head."
"Step aside, step forward."
"Whenever I say it, I'm always right."
"Everything will be different in the morning."
"That's what I do, almost every night."
"I have to leave this room."
"It's like a dream come true."
"All right, it's time to vote."
"I didn't say anything like that."
"In the name of God, the merciful."
"That's called facing reality."
"And those Irish thugs too."
"It's easier my way."
"But that's the way it goes."
"I really appreciate this, thank you."
"They can only make a good jump."
"This is going to get good."
"You're scaring everyone."
"You know perfectly well what I mean."
"It would be wise for you to remember that."
"Since I can remember."
"It must be because of the sun."
"You've been there a thousand times."
"Let's go, girl, we're getting out of here."
"It seemed like he was giving them directions."
"It's a great racing broom."
"You know I can't do that."
"To preserve our way of life."
"I have to think about my reputation."
"It has to be better than that."
"They are coming for us from heaven."
"Please go back to bed."
"I've been told it's excellent."
"I still have a long way to go to be well."
"Secret, because that thing about 'secret agents'."
"A woman needs space to breathe."
"I think he was in for a surprise."
"I'm going to go there."
"Put the lighter on the floor."
"I was looking at myself in the mirror."
"Well, I have to go now."
"He already knows I'm here."
"That's what he doesn't want."
"That's all I remember, Mom."
"The whole world is our homeland."
"I've always believed in these things."
"You know the money's gone."
"So I'll get to the point."
"I have to go to the ship."
"We will live in all the oceans now."
"I know your type."
"They deserve each other."
"You're going to need your strength today."
"Being good company, that's all."
"Of course I won't."
"Well, that's easy for you to say."
"Let's have a party in my mind."
"I can't think of what to say."
"They were shooting at each other all the time."
"But everything is going to be okay."
"A true man makes his luck."
"Yes, today is a pink day."
"You know how these things are."
"I've known her all my life."
"I'll explain it to you when I see you."
"You are the only one for me."
"Yeah, well, we have to go."
"I'm going to keep it forever."
"Come to bed, please."
"I think it was a good choice."
"We'll have to do it in the car."
"The men's bathroom is upstairs."
"I knew it before it arrived."
"The world is full of crazy people."
"I have never given up."
"I have to call my brother."
"Everything you need is here."
"It seems to be a very nice locator."
"He was in that field with Dad."
"Three for you and my department."
"And that's what counts."
"That's the name you're looking for."
"And I received the annual award."
"This thing is out of this world."
"Please raise your right hand."
"Come in and have something to drink."
"Everyone knows who he is."
"It's time to stand up."
"Just a moment, just a moment, just a moment."
"I can't think of any reason."
"Another year has passed."
"This is my house, my home."
"This news one appeared here today."
"You never keep secrets from the Captain."
"I've heard a lot of things about you."
"I don't think that's the case."
"Let's make some money."
"And now what am I going to do?"
"I'm here to learn from you."
"It's your mother's house."
"You are not Mr. Purple."
"I'm going to need men like you."
"Most likely not."
"Please let me do my job."
"Me too, before the first game."
"I want the world to know."
"I have a connection at the airport."
"Go find the remedy then."
"Everything possible has been done."
"I left her behind and continued walking."
"That's my kind of girl."
"Sir, my family will pay in cash."
"I bet you like being on top."
"And he continues with the same expression."
"Wait, this is my favorite part."
"The lagoon is for old women."
"I swear he can hear us."
"I like what I'm wearing."
"But you kept winning every time."
"You already know the answer to that."
"I've looked for him everywhere."
"I want an answer to my question."
"They are all players and potential customers."
"I just got back to town."
"May God bless us all."
"You'll see how he shuts up about that."
"Let them follow all the senators."
"It must be from another city."
"So that's what it's about."
"Here is the key to the temple."
"That boy is our last hope."
"You look so young."
"I've been waiting for this all my life."
"I'm going to read you your rights."
"We do it because it is our duty."
"I can do whatever I please."
"Quitting smoking is my goal."
"But I have to offer myself."
"Everyone pulls their own strings."
"I told him we already have it."
"There is a surveillance team inside."
"The Knights of the Round Table."
"You have to call the police."
"With something worthwhile."
"Not if it cures humanity."
"The truth will come out."
"There is a storm on the horizon."
"He had his whole life ahead of him."
"Let your mother eat, darling."
"I knew there was a good reason."
"She's not part of the deal."
"But it was a very good sauce."
"That's exactly what I'm doing."
"Nothing good can come out of this."
"My daughter will teach you our customs."
"Now I could be anywhere."
"Okay, set the table here."
"Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean."
"What you did was very brave."
"I've seen enough for today."
"I'm just putting up a new course."
"That's all, that's all."
"Let's see, let's see, let's see."
"Of course you can use my phone."
"Give me a kiss, Give me a kiss."
"I know what it meant to you."
"Things have changed a bit."
"That's between him and me."
"Maybe he is different from the others."
"Bring those two down here."
"There is plenty of room in space."
"But now it's about business."
"You know how they left my face."
"I have to talk to my brother."
"Look what the wind brought."
"I am all they have."
"I offer my deepest condolences."
"I'm running out of time."
"That's music to my ears."
"You realize that they are friends."
"It was like old times."
"I'm so glad you called."
"My God, my God, my God."
"But you didn't answer the question."
"Of course it is a known language."
"I think the time is coming."
"First you completely change your hair."
"Summer turned into winter again."
"I support you in any case."
"But things are different now."
"That would be very kind of you."
"The cars to my wife's."
"Go see my mother."
"At least the cat is back."
"If you are happy, I am happy too."
"I was doing all the work."
"And suddenly they realize."
"And having achieved it on your own."
"She spends her life in a nightgown."
"You thought not."
"I feel one of those nights coming."
"It's eight in the morning."
"So the emperor has already won."
"I'd rather get started right away."
"I'll go the other way."
"People need to hear those things."
"We're going to your mother's house."
"All right, here's the deal."
"In time, you will learn to use it."
"I thought the case was closed."
"Even if it's just one thing."
"And you know what they say."
"Like two thousand dollars a meter."
"The killers come smiling, like friends."
"There is a gun near him."
"You can't toast with water."
"I can't ask you to do that."
"As good as can be expected."
"It's just a precautionary measure."
"This will be the end of everything."
"The world was bigger before."
"That's the politics that matter."
"This is an act of war."
"It's something you've never seen before."
"We are very glad you came."
"Their loyalty is based on that."
"Okay, on the count of three."
"It must have been a beautiful scene."
"Well, first things first."
"You'll need lots and lots of money."
"Of course it's a friendly call."
"It's a great opportunity for me."
"That's just what we need."
"You are the first of many."
"I won the House Cup."
"Your driver's license, please."
"I should have told him to bring someone."
"It was everyone saving their own skin."
"I think you'll find it very interesting."
"I went to work the other day."
"Hi, I was just about to call you."
"And God himself will be with them."
"I'm going to make the call tomorrow."
"I'm the one in charge here."
"Let the women come forward."
"But not the one we need now."
"From fairy tales to religion."
"I think I want to go home."
"It's for your own good, you know."
"Because that's what you are."
"She is a Catholic school teacher."
"Some of this information is valid."
"All the boats have already left."
"Thank you very much for your kind attention."
"It's your private promenade deck."
"Trust me, buddy, you'll want to take this call."
"I knew I'd seen it before."
"Watch out for the crossfire, boys."
"As I said, it's a long story."
"That was almost a year ago."
"They did a couple of jobs together."
"There's not much to talk about."
"You are a source of pride for the Police."
"I put my faith in you, sir."
"Everything's going to be okay, yeah."
"I just have to make a call."
"And everything else I have."
"I want to know who and why."
"In fact, I can go with you."
"I'll stay here a little longer."
"So that's what we'll do."
"I wanted to thank you and I already did."
"There's something I have to say."
"I want you to earn their trust."
"I learned that from your father."
"I learned many things from my father."
"All right, go to your room."
"With 'hello' she was already yours."
"Two out of three, two out of three."
"I was hoping you'd come to me last night."
"I have to find my husband."
"It is because of you that they were murdered."
"Of course I didn't."
"Not without jumps in the sequence."
"I'll tell you one more time."
"Each one took a different path."
"It's very easy for you to say."
"Either one thing or the other."
"Well, the old world has ended."
"And that it has a big trunk."
"I have to think about my family."
"It should be a dollar each."
"That's all you can do."
"In this place, at this time."
"Well, that's what it says."
"They give you a work card."
"I walk through the valley of shadows."
"First the man, then the politics."
"I think we are equally intelligent."
"I'll call the lawyer in the morning."
"My reflection has changed a little."
"We are very, very important to them."
"Let's go before he sits down."
"That has to count for something."
"I hope Mr. Perfect is nice."
"I feel very happy and healthy."
"This is between you and me."
"That's what you're saying."
"Wait, open the gate, please."
"Those pajamas will fit you."
"See the door frame."
"I'll tell you in the morning."
"I think you're going to love it."
"I have served him for twenty years."
"Tell her she's my angel."
"Like being in a dream."
"I don't know how, but I know."
"Look at this drawing we found today."
"People will have told you."
"I want you to meet my family."
"This is my lucky day."
"The rich get richer."
"All kinds of couples come here."
"What he did was very brave."
"Maybe you can tell us who tricked us."
"I've been coming for over a year."
"You and I are very different."
"I like working here."
"Courtesy of the U.S. government."
"They are doing everything they can."
"What made us come here."
"I must take my photos when I travel."
"Maybe not now, because you are strong."
"The sellers always manage."
"Justice will reach us all."
"I'm going to see my sister."
"The best man I have ever met."

"And it's about to become a reality."
"I have to go to work, honey."
"And go to work with us."
"It was a very nice gesture."
"I know, but this is important."
"Godfather, I have something special for you."
"It now belongs to an officer."
"I think I should talk to him."
"This is the image of Mars."
"It's because that's the truth."
"The first time in the month."
"So I can see you every day."
"I never use his name."
"Poles get paid."
"My dad made it for me."
"What you have in your hand."
"Let's go see your mom."
"A lamp or a telephone booth."
"I can open it without making it explode."
"You don't know what's there."
"The one at your feet."
"And now what are we going to do?"
"By your father's will."
"I'm glad you called me."
"So let's get to work."
"You will never go to war."
"I'm leaving so you can chat."
"You have to go to bed."
"I hope I haven't kept you waiting too long."
"Let's go see her in her dressing room."
"That's precisely what it is."
"That's why we allow you to be open."
"It's fashion week."
"I stay at this level."
"Please, I have to do this."
"You're behaving like a child."
"Let's change the locks again tomorrow."
"I had to take care of my neck first."
"Peace and tranquility in my old age."
"Thank you very much for today."
"That's what you want to do."
"We must respect the Japanese."
"You have to respect the Japanese."
"Tell him not to do it again."
"We can talk about this later."
"He's crazier than a goat."
"He is a tall, black guy."
"I put it next to his bed."
"Tell it to the Board of Directors."
"Let me talk to him to find out."
"Yes, since I was five years old."
"How wonderful it is to be able to do that."
"They are calling the stable boy."
"This was on camera with you."
"That's how I win the cupcake."
"I'd better go see her."
"I'm sorry, but it can't be."
"I thought the phone wasn't working."
"Gentlemen, let's review our plans."
"Look, your brother brought a friend."
"It's what she would have wanted."
"Do you think you can participate with that?"
"I've never been a good banker."
"You and I are living proof."
"I know what they say about me."
"I know you're using another name."
"I love working with this big guy."
"There is something I would like to say."
"I want you to play along with me."
"It's the best, but without imagination."
"But since you say it like that."
"You'll see how everything turns out well."
"I rarely go to work."
"I think he deserves a drink."
"He is safe in the Dutchman."
"This was recovered on site."
"I told you last week."
"Please dial the estimated number."
"The Empress needs a new name."
"Like the games we play."
"Please give me back my son."
"Look what they've done to you."
"I think I can reach the door."
"I want the room up here."
"I know how much you want to go home."
"Someday all this will be yours."
"I would give my soul for a breeze."
"I'm proud to be your sister."
"So this is the building."
"But remember, the car is you."
"Especially for a single woman."
"Time is what I have plenty of."
"But we will send them a message."
"I think you have something for me."
"I could do anything to you right now."
"I follow his advice and keep quiet."
"If I ever find out where they are."
"We were all wondering who was writing to you."
"Yes, I see it that way too."
"It's a high-profile position."
"These things happen all the time."
"One of your horses is outside."
"I made this for him one Christmas."
"It's on the top floor."
"Let everyone be alert."
"Attached is a list of products and colors."
"He came later to ask me for a loan."
"Put the child on the floor."
"But I realized something."
"You're back in the news."
"I have to do something about it."
"And nobody likes me."
"He is a very good drug dealer."
"Because we don't do that anymore."
"We'll start with the five-card deck."
"It is a way of extracting information."
"Let's see if you can reach him."
"That's the way to do it."
"I think this is the place."
"I thought you came by car."
"Yes, that's what it looks like."
"That's when they open the lines."
"And they became a secret society."
"I want the ones in the red box."
"I'm in a wheelchair."
"I heard you have a son."
"You have to use things you know."
"At the time it seemed very important."
"He was a man in other times."
"Today will be remembered."
"Yes, in the back."
"Focus hard on what you want."
"My little son, while I was sleeping."
"First tell me where the girl is."
"To be able to know it well in America."
"He had been shot in the head."
"There are other things besides scaring."
"She is locked in a tower."
"Then I must think of a better one."
"I have the best friends in the world."
"If you need to talk, talk to your bag."
"They love the Church as much as we do."
"Only if you are a human being."
"A guy who works for me."
"They'll find him and come for us."
"I would love to be in your play."
"They'll have to choose between the two of us."
"You start looking for another house."
"You'll know when the time comes."
"A good judge is always needed."
"I have to go back there to get it back."
"I'm far from feeling well."
"I think we should do another take."
"A place on the west side."
"It's what's in fashion."
"He should get in on the action."
"I owe it all to him."
"Lunch is one hour long."
"I think they need a new sheriff."
"'This is only used by beginners.'"
"They're going to arrive any moment."
"But I've learned so much since then."
"They make you want to pray before them."
"I thought I had you there."
"You are something that doesn't exist."
"Each and every one of them."
"Women like that."
"I think it's our best option."
"If not today, it will be tomorrow."
"There are those who spend their lives together."
"I used to love hearing that sound."
"Everyone does what they can."
"And it takes you out of your sleep."
"To make sure you're paying attention."
"We've known each other since we were kids."
"It is a double-sided mirror."
"I have a question about this design."
"I'd be interested to see how he does it."
"So let's see what we can do."
"We will take you to a private doctor."
"I think it was always hers."
"There is fresh water on this island."
"Maybe the legend is better."
"This has been a great year."
"He says that's the building."
"We are talking about a human being."
"That's what we have to do."
"It seems like the ground is moving."
"I guess we're even now."
"He must be flying on a private plane."
"In my dreams we are still together."
"And get dressed, for God's sake."
"We will continue broadcasting as long as possible."
"I will do whatever you ask of me."
"Finish the job in the air."
"My father will find out about this."
"I thought you were going home."
"You have to start a new life."
"I was planning it all day."
"I take the lady to breakfast."
"I was thinking about what you said."
"A peacock on the wall."
"It's over what was given."
"You'll have to sign for this ship."
"A friend of mine has a rug."
"Aim for what you want most."
"All we have is this."
"No lawyers, no trials, no nothing."
"I'm the bomber and I'm fine."
"Sometimes it's better not to know."
"It's going very well, it's going very well."
"Give him his money and a soap."
"Maybe a teacher, or a neighbor."
"Nobody knows who gave the order."
"There are many things you don't understand."
"I can't deal with that now."
"You make the machine work."
"Oh yeah, that's very good."
"Make him tell you where it is."
"We can give them a piece as a souvenir."
"I didn't hear what the bet was."
"What I need is the truth."
"I have two sons and one daughter."
"Fishing was his latest hobby."
"But I could be passionate if I wanted to."
"Don't judge this by merit."
"God, what a great pick-up line."
"But you go home."
"It's good to be home, Dad."
"I want you to think about this very carefully."
"You just keep your hand moving."
"Yeah, I'm kind of figuring it out."
"At all times, Dad leads."
"In case 'looking' becomes 'buying'."
"On a yacht at the dock."
"This is the glass man."
"Senator, I will give you my answer now."
"I'm a pretty sensible guy."
"The train didn't come here."
"Don't tell your father."
"I want to thank you all for coming."
"Tell him I really appreciate it."
"Come to the back."
"I was very sick when I was a child."
"You took the name of this town."
"This is a dream come true."
"You and I have common interests."
"This just came for you."
"I'll show you what I mean."
"And that's where I come in."
"He says that the neighbors do not comply."
"Good luck in this new venture."
"With the First Secretary, please."
"Twenty-foot dragon tail."
"It's time to choose a side."
"It's late but it's good to see you."
"I need a man with powerful friends."
"We'll talk about this in the morning."
"Tell him not to call anyone."
"I have a daughter your age."
"There is a map on the phone."
"He has a whole life ahead of him."
"In this village of the city."
"The greatest thrill of my life."
"A good neighbor, a good worker."
"Breakfast is on the table."
"There's someone here who wants to see you."
"And that's just for starters."
"Today has been a tough day."
"You weren't supposed to see that."
"Thank you for coming from so far away."
"The ladies are their own police."
"The one you have in your pants."
"It's the same old story."
"Don't tell him I told you."
"I want you to meet some people."
"Everything was fine when we were young."
"Nice to see you, old friend."
"On the street, with a horn."
"No one can know we are here."
"That was a very good question."
"I hope she is very happy."
"Let me talk to him, please."
"I was going to go to the mall."
"Look at all the space there is."
"The dog is in the car."
"He has the bit between his teeth."
"I went out with him after you."
"It was my case and my decision."
"I'll do anything for my Godfather."
"I'll take good care of that girl."
"Listen, tell him he'll be okay."
"The same thing happens with Europeans."
"For your mother and your sister."
"I can't leave, I have to work."
"It's just his way of speaking."
"As soon as you see it, call us."
"I want a picture with both of you."
"Everyone else has done it."
"Well, I hope I don't have any more children."
"This is true love."
"It is a masterpiece of engineering."
"You're right, I have a lot to learn."
"I don't think you have the courage."
"I think I'm going to be okay."
"It's in tomorrow's paper."
"Sorry to have kept you waiting."
"He might be glad to see us."
"Using them is all we have."
"Mother will take care of him when we arrive."
"I'd better go to bed."
"I am a world-class singer."
"One of the best in the country."
"The other two changed their minds."
"Come on, we have to find another door."
"Even if it's the last thing I do."
"I was about to order something to take away."
"He had a wife and a daughter."
"Well, I actually found two things."
"Everyone knows why I'm here."
"I'm in the middle of an operation."
"A glass of water with ice."
"Now you are my only love."
"I think it's even longer ago."
"The manuscript is in my office."
"It is the most beautiful of all."
"I always liked that about you."
"I'm so happy to be here."
"This place has all the flavors."
"It's amazing that you have that painting."
"Someone has to take care of you, you big hairy one."
"So I'll have to marry you."
"To the moon and back."
"You're the only one who remembered."
"Sir, there is movement on the ground."
"I am the best man at the wedding."
"Dinner out is green-lit."
"Now you have to think about yourself."
"We can do something about your arm."
"People, what they wear."
"A new shipment is arriving tomorrow."
"Not used on this finger."
"That was then, this is now."
"Honestly, you're a pretty smart guy."
"You're doing everything you can."
"And the two creatures attacked each other."
"More, if you think about it."
"Prepare food and drink."
"I'm sorry you had to see that."
"With your face, it looks wonderful."
"You wanted a door and there it is."
"First name, then last name."
"I have some important announcements to make."
"This is what I want to do."
"He is in a wheelchair."
"It's the best game in the world."
"As if it were the first time."
"All ships switch to missiles."
"We bring some things for the family."
"You have to go back to the family."
"Then he could be prosecuted for perjury."
"Sorry, the door was open."
"There's something else you should know."
"You need to listen to what she says."
"This is the best of all."
"Thanks for staying on the path."
"That's what it seems to be."
"Go around the block."
"The girl fits, but you don't."
"You and I are very similar."
"Put the phone on the floor."
"And you know I'll always love you."
"He always carries cigarettes and a lighter."
"I swear to you by my mother."
"This is the manager's desk."
"What a beautiful beach that is over there."
"An exceptional beauty in the North."
"I renounce avenging my son."
"Whatever I want."
"And we can be together forever."
"It's all I know how to do."
"Use the coordinates from the last launch."
"I have to be somewhere."
"Looks like it was a great night."
"That's what I imagined."
"I'd love to go with you right now."
"I've had a lot of birthday parties."
"It contains things that are very valuable to me."
"But of course I told him."
"It's what your science pays for."
"Maybe he had a lot to think about."
"Three to two against mercy."
"Now it's just you and me."
"I was just in the living room."
"It is the source of his power."
"It does not dry out in this humidity."
"This reduces the insurance premium."
"Hello, melon heart, congratulations."
"Have a nice dinner Captain."
"Well, it's your lucky day."
"This is very important to you."
"There's more where that came from."
"That's the million-dollar question."
"Now it's time for you to come back."
"Nobody is going to tell you anything."
"Each and every one of you."
"This place has an illustrious past."
"I feel like I can trust you."
"For God's sake, you're just a child."
"I can tell you about the future."
"I always keep it under my pillow."
"I'm sure I can speak for Dad."
"They gave him the role he wanted."
"Well, the show is about to begin."
"I dream of being with you forever."
"It's about taking it and bringing it."
"You either accept it or you walk away."
"That's why it had to arrive today."
"It all started when Dracula was killed."
"I will need other things, when they are needed."
"Just tell me what I have to do."
"I think you're going to be okay."
"Please come home, Dad."
"I think he dropped this."
"It was one of those days."
"You already know where the door is."
"You men are all the same."
"What a way to start my retirement."
"But you can do whatever you want."
"Everything's going to be okay, Mom."
"And that's what I am."
"I thought I made it clear."
"There's something I have to show you."
"This film is dedicated to them."
"Ah, the kids these days."
"I hope you like fish."
"Just a flick of his pen."
"She will fulfill all her tasks."
"Well, we have to give it a name."
"The essential and the most significant."
"I want to know what we're up against."
"The best kiss of my life."
"I owe my happiness to him."
"I'm going to have it removed."
"My dad too, in the store."
"If that's what they want."
"You have to give me a new name."
"It's time to close the museum."
"You will be at the link at the bottom."
"I can't find it anywhere."
"There is more news about your father."
"It's the last thing you'll ever see."
"Please tell me your real name."
"I'm going to tell mom."
"Did you have something more important to do?"
"I don't know anything about any kidnapping."
"One more and my children will live."
"That was all that was left."
"We're seeing the same thing as you."
"Sorry, it's very noisy here."
"I agree with you on that."
"Two subjects leaving the house."
"These are some of our teachers."
"You are a creature of the night."
"Come to my balcony, my love."
"It's a fact of life."
"That's called taking initiative, son."
"Now that we're starting, the first task."
"My name depends on this movie."
"He is a man of his word, modest, reasonable."
"I'm talking to my family."
"He's been there for two days."
"You have the table set for two."
"Go to the living room."
"I have to find the right file."
"The right pilot has been found."
"And do what I tell you."
"Pieces of rocks, sand and water."
"I can't allow that to happen."
"My bag is in the kitchen."
"Well, there's always a first time."
"There are very strong traces below us."
"I just said I heard it."
"Make sure he kisses everyone."
"This news is going to be published."
"It's like an amusement park."
"And please don't say anything."
"It's the best I've ever seen."
"The one you're obsessed with."
"I'm the one who feels it."
"I can't do anything about that."
"I have a lump in my throat."
"I'll see you tomorrow night."
"That will be the end of the world."
"Thank God you're there."
"The Beast is in the forest."
"He said it was a party."
"And less so in front of my mom."
"You accidentally activated your navigation system."
"On the boat we were in public."
"That's what life is all about."
"That's what he's saying."
"I was one of those children."
"I ask my mother for forgiveness."
"After everything that happened."
"Their friendship has always done so."
"Dad, I have a gift for you."
"You can study them during the flight."
"It was my father's name."
"We can talk about that later."
"I understand that he is your brother."
"I'm sure you'll be fine."
"And I have found mine."
"That's why we have to finish."
"A friendly and business visit."
"Oh, it's because of your love."
"Oh, he's a happy bear."
"I have betrayed myself."
"I think it's in the kitchen."
"Don't look at your uncle, boy."
"Because I can't live without her."
"And now it's your turn."
"We will need accurate images of each column."
"Let's go find our friend."
"I've had a very long day."
"The one who works in commercial."
"It's five in the morning."
"It was one of hers."
"Today I realized something."
"Let's see if you settle down."
"A thorn that you can remove."
"This is how our race was born."
"A new planet we call home."
"If your father could see you now."
"The house with the red door."
"I tell him everything will be okay."
"Just for a couple of days."
"Turn around when possible."
"You look half starved."
"I'm so glad you came."
"He lives two blocks from here."
"I'm going to call your father."
"For your cooperation, you will have my gratitude."
"The Americans are there too, many of them."
"Tell her I'll call her, please."
"Please remain in your place."
"Let's go back to your mother's house."
"And I've trained him well, look."
"Same mission pattern as always."
"Whatever we want."
"I give you an order, you accept it."
"And a photo for the album."
"Let's try it one more time."
"The expenses are on me."
"He's going to eat the cat."
"I think I can live with that."
"I'll be happy to tell you what happened."
"She gave her life for you."
"Give it to him and we'll get out of here."
"I sent him Christmas shopping."
"It was my father's dream."
"Get in that truck and drive."
"Look, I have to tell you something else."
"And good science is good observation."
"But I was already in love, with you."
"The world needs both."
"And I'm proud to call them allies."
"Tomorrow I will read you your favorite story."
"Christmas is not over yet."
"Come meet my friends."
"At no point have we said that."
"Let her go and let's talk business."
"I think someone already did it."
"The door was open and I walked in."
"The emergency team is across the street."
"Very sick, but they are fine now."
"This was to calm the adult."
"Have you shot anyone before?"
"Let's see if you like that."
"But he is quite sick."
"It's somewhere in the lab."
"Mom, look at that big guy."
"There is always a reason to live."
"I'm leaving tomorrow morning."
"And yet everyone does it."
"They say they're coming for you."
"Balloon man, you are a balloon man."
"It is used by an unauthorized agent."
"With the police, quickly, please."
"From the girl of my dreams."
"That's between father and son."
"But there is something you should know."
"Of certain changes I want to make."
"It's in my mom's name."
"It's not much, but it's something."
"You're going to have to do it yourself."
"The world is very big, Mom."
"There is a good cook, good performances."
"They just delivered a whole box."
"He says he's in love with you."
"Wait until you have your own lawn."
"Here he comes with the other release."
"How I wish I were bigger."
"Look, don't think about it anymore."
"I changed into something more comfortable."
"I will give him whatever he asks for."
"My daughters already read the newspaper."
"He did inherit that from you."
"But you know what they say."
"That's all that counts."
"I had a special visitor this afternoon."
"I do what I want, when I want."
"With all the riches of the world.'"
"I thought I could, but I can't."
"But what happened to the stone?"
"You are here of your own free will."
"I've waited a long time to meet you."
"I would never think that of you."
"That's the main business here."
"It is very important that you understand that."
"Speak of your devotion to me."
"A diamond, and buy a big one."
"The place is a land of criminals."
"The key is balance."
"At three in the morning."
"That's all I can ask for."
"I came to see your boss."
"I was doing research for a book."
"I think this is going to work."
"I want to move forward in time now."
"It must have cost him a fortune."
"I've been thinking about this a lot."
"It's been a very long few days."
"You are the daughter of the former leader."
"You know nothing about love."
"I think that's what it's all about."
"They live separately from other men."
"This would be the time to do it."
"Correct and the money is generous."
"The car you ordered has arrived."
"You've kept your end of the bargain."
"That's where the lab is."
"Day and night I think about her."
"I want more men behind the scenes."
"They were going to go out again, right?"
"He has a boat in the port."
"It's in the safe downstairs."
"It's going to screw up your life."
"I'll tell you, take one as a gift."
"I told you everything would be okay."
"Only what they didn't eat."
"I already told you twice."
"This is a quarantine area."
"You said I could trust you."
"Now I need you to trust me."
"Everything we need is here."
"So I'm almost family."
"Let's hope it's not too late."
"I've already said everything I know."
"I am the best girlfriend in the world."
"It's not like I know your name."
"You can use water from the air."
"And you were going to take care of it."
"Not all my memories are good."
"He is approaching our vehicle quickly."
"This is where the fun begins."
"That's what they're waiting for."
"That's why we have an impartial system."
"The one in the wheelchair."
"My plane leaves in an hour."
"I'm glad to meet you too."
"He is the best foreman in the county."
"The woman who was destined for him."
"We have the whole house to ourselves."
"The system really learned to learn."
"At two in the afternoon."
"It must feed on energy to survive."
"I have to go to the square."
"Please tell me what I should do."
"For the account that brings them."
"He probably calls them all that."
"I have heard of him."
"Give it a little more time."
"Well, this is my insurance, sir."
"After everything I did."
"The things I do for you."
"I hope you enjoy my watch."
"This place was just the hook."
"Now you have confidence in yourself."
"Thanks again for doing this."
"I hope business goes well."
"I don't think I need them anymore."
"That's the memory I chose."
"I am very excited to see your culture."
"I'm sorry for what I said."
"Who used to live in this house."
"You have the spirit of your mother."
"I work in a travel agency."
"That's the one I came up with."
"I'll see you in about twenty hours."
"I have my breakfast at eight."
"What you couldn't do."
"So we still have hope."
"Please tell me you have something."
"A couple of times a month."
"They are all the humans in the world."
"I thank you for that."
"Get out of the house right now."
"I have an old phone number."
"And that's important to me."
"You like to be independent."
"They always come in threes."
"You have all the money in the world."
"I'm going home for half an hour."
"I don't know, but you do."
"I'm going to find my son."
"This is a good place to camp."
"I wasn't there with you, my son."
"I think we should hope for the best."
"I can also play the Black Swan."
"I was someone's baby."
"I was hired to do a job."
"You can't be seen with this."
"Let's leave the sisters out of it."
"You've heard of him."
"I heard you inside my head."
"The one that was in my envelope."
"All you do is work."
"We are going to have a great evening."
"It was a million to one chance."
"A lady wishes to see the captain."
"And we all remember his father."

"Then everyone will receive their share."
"It's my mother's house."
"So they're not going to change anything."
"You could do the same thing as me."
"It will be as if it had never existed."
"You need to turn around and go back."
"Nobody is going to care about us."
"Tell him it was you and that's it."
"We'll go see her in her dressing room."
"Although his foot is very heavy."
"It's the lowest you can go."
"It must have been a beautiful house."
"Let's go find the others."
"Keep it in your heart and goodbye.'"
"To make something of your life."
"I feel perfectly fine breathing fresh air."
"On the existence of a soul."
"Maybe she didn't pay him."
"I think you've done enough."
"It's Judgment Day."
"Come live in my factory."
"Forever and ever and ever."
"I know who you're referring to."
"You should show me pictures of Mexican police officers."
"I do believe in fairies."
"Well, that's what they say."
"That path is our best option."
"My love, we have to go."
"I told you to stay here."
"You will be his crown jewel."
"Guess who he shares his office with."
"I was already leaving to meet you."
"Let's try it with the toothbrush."
"It's all wood inside."
"The disciplinary committee will be meeting."
"Math is at the end of the hall."
"I can't even say his name."
"Return to the agency immediately."
"And my men are excellent shooters."
"Shots from behind the square."
"It's a pleasure to be back."
"I'll eat all the cakes I want."
"This has level four priority."
"That's what's done."
"At least when I'm around."
"It's my mother's recipe."
"Make sure not to touch the end."
"And you are one of them."
"Let's go downtown, to the delegation."
"I changed my life with three things."
"If you walk out that door, yes."
"They could have found it in your eye."
"Bodies and minds that match."
"Now, let's see how it grips the corners."
"It's what we've always wanted."
"Come here just for a second."
"I love it when you talk about mechanics."
"You are my man in secret."
"You've always been a good friend."
"You have so much passion for life."
"I am the commanding officer."
"I had a sequence made for you."
"The single bullet theory."
"So that's our castle."
"This is for your own good."
"But it can never go into space."
"That's what I weigh."
"I know he'll grow up to be someone."
"I suggested a rather incredible possibility to him."
"Because I don't know how to sing or dance."
"You have to ask him something very important."
"So admit what you did."
"You proved your argument intelligently."
"Let's put it another way."
"And I to you, my life."
"And I will be the one who chooses."
"It's a new world for them."
"Thank God we found you."
"It's just a little different."
"I'm like a racing car."
"As if I'd never seen it before."
"I thought it wasn't his car."
"I just called the police."
"It's what I've been looking for."
"I'll tell him when I see him."
"I want soft tits, soft tits."
"My first day in the unit."
"This is the real place."
"They are praying, but they are almost finished."
"Please don't do anything to them."
"I have a spare among my tools."
"So you like apples."
"This is what dreams are made of."
"And I love you just the way you are."
"I appreciate what you've done."
"She is a new friend of mine."
"It just so happens that I like my job."
"It must be something in the water."
"My cards are on the table."
"That's what I was waiting for."
"No one remains good in this world."
"Keep doing what you were doing."
"You know you can't be here."
"I am a big fan of you."
"It's the sound that sets you free."
"If they see us now it's over."
"That will be the first thing, when we finish."
"I take it very seriously."
"This guy will practically live forever."
"It was a key that did everything."
"He is going to support the defense."
"I can imagine you when you were six years old."
"For some he was a guardian angel."
"I'm just warming it up for you."
"I hope you opened the wine."
"I like being in court."
"I want to live with music."
"Connect that to the motherboard."
"Actually, I came to talk to you."
"They took everything we had."
"I am the mother of your child."
"You haven't said a single word."
"She was looking forward to seeing you again."
"Looks like we arrived just in time."
"I can open it with a wire."
"I've seen what it can do."
"We have the upper hand."
"Art always chooses the truth."
"It's time to make a change."
"That's how things are sometimes."
"I've done it all for you."
"This is going to be a quit."
"I decided not to travel after all."
"You have a tremendous right hook."
"From the land of beyond."
"I've always been able to count on her."
"Look who's back from sick leave."
"You haven't changed the room much."
"I want you in the special forces."
"They don't know anything about points."
"Thank you, very kind of you."
"I slept with her once."
"Before I knew it, we were outside."
"But, gosh, that's hours of work."
"It's packed with people down there."
"I've done everything I could."
"And the heart of an ox."
"I'll tell you whatever you want to know."
"Knowing that he is in charge."
"Expect a reward for the album."
"It's an important day for you."
"I thought you were never going to wake up."
"They are in the morgue."
"I'll give you a try out of courtesy."
"I know you're there, Miss Miss."
"Any noise, they'll think it's him."
"I advise you not to do it."
"Carry on as if you didn't know anything."
"Hit it with your finger."
"I'll see you this weekend."
"Yes, I'm serious."
"My children were superior to me."
"For your health and mine."
"We work in the reformatory for boys."
"You don't have many lives left."
"Gold Coast Grain."
"It's a library tape."
"I think the interview is over."
"It's not about that at all."
"Making noise, not knowing what to do."
"Bring your motorcycle and I'll show you."
"You know, with the usual ones."
"We have to notify his family."
"Remember what the doctor said."
"You looked very good when you were young."
"For now, tell him where to go."
"Entire generations will live thanks to you."
"I have to look for my daughter."
"It's my family's house."
"And you should have seen the coffin."
"Or else, come with me."
"It's the only thing that matters to you."
"Or don't be any of those things."
"Those were short-range missiles."
"I want you to see it for yourself."
"But the story is all here."
"That was when it was just us."
"The guy is in a tub."
"I insist that you keep the deal."
"I've seen them come and go."
"I don't have to talk either, friend."
"The doctors say I'll be fine."
"I hope nothing happened."
"Simply the best of you."
"You are not anyone's friend."
"They say, 'You don't have to do this.'"
"No one has seen her since."
"I stood right in front of him."
"You look very pretty in that dress."
"People do what they want."
"He is very sure of himself."
"You are the man I love."
"I've seen you somewhere."
"I must go to Berlin immediately."
"But I brought you some tea."
"Everyone is watching us."
"White skin on the black market."
"That will get you halfway there."
"Which is the best in town?"
"A good fort needs an exit."
"Because when my men find you."
"My brother likes you."
"I was expecting him, but not so soon."
"Hello friend, I didn't expect to see you here."
"And so far it has worked well."
"That's why we need you."
"Of course you would think about that."
"I think it's time to get up."
"Also because the house always wins."
"Put someone else on it."
"My cousin is also in Iraq."
"You shouldn't talk at all."
"How do they do things like this at reception?"
"The front door was open."
"That's how it is all over the world."
"Why I do what I do."
"Hers is bigger."
"I hope it's not the last."
"I'm doing the test again."
"This is how I live my life."
"But you can look for a back door."
"Sorry, son, we have nothing."
"You have united us for eternity."
"I think it's one of them."
"The red-capped men are approaching."
"I'm going to get that girl."
"So what are you going to tell me?"
"I think these things are safe."
"I didn't ask who gave the order."
"I'm sure you can think of something."
"People even sing about it."
"Cease fire, cease fire."
"There are still men in the water."
"Honey, everything is going to be okay."
"I want us to be together again."
"The most powerful lenses in the world."
"This other guy is smaller."
"But I have to talk to him."
"It may be the last thing they do."
"I can talk on the phone now, perfect."
"I'm the only one who can do it."
"If a siren appears, I'll call you."
"Stay inside it forever."
"I don't expect them to like me."
"Unconscious when he was taken to the bathroom."
"Now I would like to introduce you to some friends."
"I'm helping him with the sale."
"It's my grandmother's name."
"I think I know where it might be."
"That's exactly what it looks like."
"Tell them we don't accept Republicans here."
"You have to hold on a little longer."
"At the head of the revolution."
"That's the soap I used."
"The main course and the dessert."
"Plus, my daughter loves it."
"Sex is part of it."
"The bones will still be there when we return."
"I thought it would be a girlfriend of his."
"I think we owe him an apology."
"Give the letter to your mother."
"Almost a good place to visit."
"A train is coming from the other side."
"Nothing stays here for long."
"Make way for the ice cream truck."
"I have a bond in the bank."
"Love is like a day."
"Go to the doctor, go home."
"This city has had many disasters."
"Go show them how it's done."
"I found you a painting class."
"Put your head on the chest."
"They're going to call the police."
"I hope everything goes well for you."
"Wait until I show you."
"He knew exactly where the creature was."
"All right, Target Shooting, up you go."
"And you're going to be sensational."
"I feel that happiness is approaching."
"But now I have you."
"It's paradise on Earth."
"But love improves the face."
"Get your men out of here."
"Specifically those surrounding the Earth."
"That's not what I asked him."
"A number tells you all that."
"So I decided to come see you."
"I have studied comics thoroughly."
"It's basically made of pure meat."
"Son, you know they don't talk."
"Not at a time like this."
"That you are here for a reason."
"I need you to go to my office."
"Say 'please' and I will."
"I've been wanting to talk to you for a while."
"I wish you could see us both."
"A secret squadron of brave soldiers."
"I think the answer is here."
"Let me speak to him, please."
"If he does, you can touch it."
"Next, through these doors."
"For the rest of his life."
"I guess I've said a lot of things."
"I was right about her."
"Calling the Captain of Heaven, go ahead."
"It's going to fry everything up here."
"This is what heaven must be like."
"Pick one and focus on it."
"There could be dark days ahead."
"The sheikh wants him there now."
"When I have time, I'll take a look."
"Maps to the presidents' houses."
"Not found at the moment."
"But thank God it's over."
"You're glad he's back."
"You have to understand, it's a job."
"The secret is in the wrist."
"I always felt like I owed you something."
"You've hit the bottom of this beer."
"From our family to yours."
"I have to stay near the phone."
"Or a lion ate him."
"That's when we make our move."
"Three-quarters of a kilometer downstream."
"It's not that I said anything."
"A little more towards this side."
"We'll talk to your operator."
"I need to talk to her right now."
"What he wrote in his cell."
"This pink velvet is very pretty."
"I made you a cup of tea."
"I got into all this."
"You have to find us another way, over."
"In your world, I have another name."
"I know my way around the kitchen."
"Look, I have to go now."
"It's the only way to go."
"Six months, maybe a year."
"A diamond bullet to the forehead."
"It makes for a fun summer game."
"All of Rome celebrates your return, Caesar."
"I just want you to know the truth."
"We have come to reclaim our land."
"Now he wants to finish what he started."
"Your secretary is on the phone."
"I have to get to now."
"It's my father's name."
"He's awake if you want to see him."
"I was about to make myself a drink."
"And above all, discipline with money."
"One by three, three by five."
"I told you all about him."
"For now, I'll take your files."
"But he left it here for a reason."
"Yes, yes, it's in front of me."
"And you should do the same."
"You're running out of space."
"Once again, we agree."
"Tell them to get back in the cars."
"Oh, you made my bet."
"I'd better get out of this way."
"I already said she's my wife."
"I have come of my own free will."
"I love coke with whiskey."
"They changed it somehow, morons."
"Tell them to join us."
"The boy must have the matrix."
"Let's take the tooth samples."
"Everyone has the right to defense."
"I'm glad to be going to Europe."
"I wish you both the best."
"Us against them, whatever the cost."
"Luckily, it seems we have enough."
"Children look like you."
"Be happy with what you have."
"It's for your own good, boy."
"By the way, thanks for the pineapple."
"There is a huge space between us."
"They have a kind of protective shield."
"I was going to have all night."
"People who have nothing."
"I worked in a tanning salon."
"I thought it meant something to you."
"At a party, for a girl."
"I have to go, the police are coming."
"There's something I want you to do."
"Or what was left of it."
"Give you a new face."
"Man, we're gonna need night vision."
"It's best to take her back."
"I hope you can forgive me someday."
"I want to know who you were talking to."
"Lieutenant, you'd better get in here."
"Then we must find someone who knows."
"I've never seen you around."
"I am teaching at the school."
"It's one o'clock in the afternoon."
"Everything will be okay, daughter."
"Yes, that's easy for you to say."
"I can do something that others can't."
"We are in the middle of the road."
"It's still one of my dreams."
"I'd say the odds are high."
"Mine is still coffee."
"They are the best in town."
"They're fine, at least for now."
"He came to train the Militia."
"You weren't supposed to be there."
"I've already told you yes."
"I was in the north block."
"I want to end this the way I started it."
"Day after day, he looked at her."
"You'll be back by dinner."
"Thanks for the party last night?"
"I want to see your best side."
"I think you didn't put enough aluminum."
"I don't think we can do that."
"They say hair is everything."
"That's where I feel."
"Out of the way, out of the way."
"They are at the pressure door."
"They are changing everything in nursing."
"Go over there, to the right."
"Because that should be the other way around."
"The last house on the left."
"But I think from time to time."
"I must talk to her about it."
"All that's left for you to do is give me back my book."
"This is the commander's chair."
"My father always told the truth."
"Go there and pull those stones."
"I hope it continues, we made a promise."
"I think he will do very well."
"And we can charge whatever we want."
"It will only last a couple of minutes."
"I just wanted to check that this was the case."
"I wanted to examine your specimen in detail."
"I want to thank you for helping me."
"I don't think that was it."
"But everyone on Earth will live."
"I'll take care of this when I get back."
"This is a family dinner."
"Just talk to me about this."
"What is the meaning of this?"
"From a clinical point of view."
"Tell them we're heading West."
"This is going to be so much fun."
"Everything ready waiting to be connected."
"I ran into an old friend."
"Hundreds of people, everywhere."
"They took her from top to bottom."
"So they look like an arrow."
"We will be able to do it."
"We need something to open the bag."
"I brought you what you asked for."
"He has big plans for you."
"Say what you told him last night."
"Putting one foot in front of the other."
"Everyone agrees."
"They put it in their body."
"They need to know what they're up against."
"Now that he's gone, let's move."
"I think I've found someone."
"A visit from an old friend."
"The girl with the glass of water."
"I came as soon as I received your message."
"I want to see my children grow up."
"And a hug and a kiss."
"This is better than sex."
"It's a pleasure to have made contact."
"As simple as everything great."
"And he laughed as loud as he could."
"I know you made a long trip."
"At least you know their names."
"Dad goes straight to the target."
"You were at my birthday party."
"Where is the accident site?"
"We found fragments of letters in it."
"I dream that better times will come."
"Looks like your boy isn't coming."
"You will be soldiers of Christ."
"I want good things to happen to him."
"I'll deal with you later."
"A last chance never is."
"Listen, I have a job for you."
"I like being at the entrance."
"Yes, the food is very good."
"Come on, we'll see it better from behind."
"All those monsters on a plane."
"You need tits to stand that close."
"It's the only option we have."
"But he has something prepared for you."
"Someone calling dad, mom."
"And now the time has come."
"Look, I have a job to do."
"That the man was very heavy."
"I'm glad to know you as a friend."
"I had the name, I swear."
"I hope you have your bags packed."
"And a low-calorie dessert."
"I saw a girl at the party."
"Nice to see you all."
"Each book has its own destiny."
"Unless you do it."
"First, my car and my parents."
"There are new drugs every day."
"It's the end of the story."
"All right, gentlemen, the time has come."
"You are the most important thing to me."
"Where is the rest of the squadron?"
"Gee, yeah, I meant it."
"I wrote a biography about its author."
"I haven't heard anything about that."
"To the one who betrayed the world."
"Some were two at once."
"It's time to do something else."
"It's not a very good photo."
"If that makes you feel better."
"I thought you were at work."
"The boy is totally drugged up."
"Everything I say is true."
"I'm like a Renaissance man."
"Go get my dog."
"He's been waiting for this day for years."
"Overnight."
"I have what I came for."
"I thought you liked this."
"But at first they were just orders."
"But we're running out of time."
"Courtesy of the gentleman opposite."
"Please don't be surprised."
"Sir, you are young after all."
"The feeding season has begun."
"Looks like you're leaving now, friend."
"Someday I'll have a real job."
"Nothing can happen to you in your space."
"You know what it's made of."
"I think he's coming around."
"Sometimes I do what I want."
"I want you to see them too."
"A place to rest in peace."
"I think I know that girl."
"I am in touch with humanity."
"I came to see the Dauphin."
"The Pope gives him a job."
"I think you had gotten up to five."
"Only if she behaves."
"Everyone is talking about her."
"Things must be done right."
"We believe that every life is special."
"Go and enjoy your birthday."
"I have to call my lawyer."
"I want the best of the best."
"He feels comfortable with his people."
"A priest would be the perfect witness."
"One could swim to the mainland."
"The sheikh will have a medical examination."
"And everything seemed to be going so well."
"Give me a chance to apologize."
"I have the information you asked for."
"And good morning to you too."
"You were fooling us the whole time."
"That depends on how long you want to live."
"I want you to go to the river."
"Please call the police."
"Put your hand in the box."
"We'll go there and see what happened."
"Have a nice day, honey."
"Maybe that grave isn't his."
"I'll get to work on that."
"I think you're exaggerating a little."
"You just have to pull the trigger."
"The next day, we started his training."
"She knew no one would believe it."
"This is worth its weight in gold."
"They are like a family to me."
"You see enough in the media."
"Just do what I told you."
"You're going to have to come with me."
"Look for survivors and secure the area."
"He has the loyalty of the people."
"Eternal life as part of the Chosen One."
"I'll take care of him, sir."
"You said our DNA was identical."
"Amazing what white people know."
"I think it's better if I wait."
"They know what they have to do."
"And he has to serve his sentence."
"I arrived as quickly as I could."
"I'm glad to hear an American voice."
"The place was full of corpses."
"He's a marvel with the needle."
"The ceremony will be next week."
"Please put it in its place."
"I've seen the rest of the world."
"Your Spanish is good enough."
"I have brought peace to the Republic."
"I'll give you a place to hide."
"Then we better open a file now."
"You're the only one who can do it."
"In the old members' depot."
"He's in a better place now."
"It's more than just our jobs."
"That dome makes you see visions."
"Maybe it has something to do with it."
"You found your wife and son."
"I rely on her to attract clients."
"I'll eat on the rescue boat."
"I remember saying exactly the same thing."
"Just imagine what you want to be."
"You are the best father in the world."
"I think it went pretty well."
"Snow at the end of the rainbow."
"There were people who wanted to hear us."
"The light at the end of the tunnel."
"So that I have a flag."
"There will be something more dramatic, of course."
"You will eat everything they give you."
"Let's go running, keep moving."
"I know every inch of her body."
"May peace be with you."
"I'm going to the function."
"And then I saw you on TV."
"You're my entire client list."
"I have a message for Germany."
"I'm sure you'll understand."
"I have to marry him."

"This one looks great on you too."
"You know what I like."
"That was the last thing he wrote."
"I've thought about that too."
"You are the only thing I have."
"I was once in your place."
"Until my last day, they believe."
"We must think of others."
"It seems like he's doing well."
"In fact, I study all the sciences."
"They say they haven't seen it either."
"It's my way of saying 'thank you'."
"You have to be careful with that."
"You've come as far as you can."
"The time has to be exact."
"I think that will be the best."
"I like the way you explain things."
"I see you got some respectable clothes, boy."
"You love games of skill."
"The most beautiful name in the world."
"And bring them back safe and sound."
"So that you come to your senses."
"Okay, we have to get rid of him."

"Only he could pull so many strings."
"Gentlemen, this is now a police matter."
"I spent many nights thinking about you."
"You can start with the simplest."
"The neighborhood could do both."
"So it's based on your life."
"He thinks the mouse will sleep inside."
"Yes, I asked him if he wanted to go."
"With all the cameras they have."
"There has to be a better way."
"I knew exactly what was waiting for me."
"Look how happy they look here."
"I was laughing for several weeks."
"You said you had something for me."
"Merry Christmas and Happy New Year."
"He's talking like my older brother."
"Enjoy your weekend."
"They're just a couple of drunks."
"In my case, it improved my reflexes."
"It's time to say goodnight."
"Nothing is worth more than bills."
"In the center of civilization."
"You were always stronger than me."
"So, you live in a house."
"I feel light as a feather."
"Airplanes are already out of fashion."
"Here it is, in black and white."
"Every night I become this."
"It's getting a little late."
"Maybe I thought I did it."
"Try to reach the last ones."
"In case you're interested."
"Nobody in this world is perfect."
"It actually has to do with you."
"On the beach of that island."
"Okay, we'll face him."
"Tell me we're still on the road."
"All right, let's see what's here."
"That's not what he said."
"That's where I need to go."
"But it's good to be home."
"All systems have gone offline."
"There's something I still don't understand."
"I promise you I'll always be there."
"I'd better tell you."
"We have the right to know the truth."
"We are professionals, we will take care of you."
"We're going to go with them."
"Come eat and drink with me."
"I thought it was worth a try."
"I'm sure you'll come up with something."
"Next to the old Spanish mission."
"This is part of history."
"Of course, we can never do anything."
"Until the spice changed them."
"It's my special sweet, I like it."
"To the families of their men."
"Bring those men to the USA."
"When I decide you're ready."
"You seem to be having a good time."
"It seems to be a new record."
"I want you to meet your father."
"And we took a DNA sample."
"Across the square."
"My father was a metal engineer."
"Now tell me what it's about."
"But as he said, it's over."
"Look what you've done now."
"I haven't seen anyone else."
"So that's your name."
"Traveler's checks and registration."
"Whatever happens, don't shout."
"This is a completely different situation."
"You're going to wake up the children."
"I'll tell them I can't do it."
"Remember that you are one of us."
"They are the only ones I have left."
"Keep moving until you pass the fountain."
"You were like a son to him."
"I hope you get married soon."
"The one in the suit in the kitchen."
"The law is on your side."
"There must be something on the ship."
"Well, and me too, partly."
"I don't think they'll let us."
"Give me my car keys."
"You knew exactly what I meant."
"I ask you for an act of faith."
"Post a guard in front of his cell."
"The Graysons are behind this."
"Ready for a systems assessment."
"This is going to change very soon."
"I will need money and credit cards."
"I think those look good on you."
"Your chances are everyone's."
"Except for something in the brain."
"Years of beauty, goat cheese."
"What can you tell us about this?"
"I want you to pull the blue one."
"Things started to make sense."
"For not asking me if I did it."
"Please, someone grab her."
"I'm going to make this work."
"Your mother sells cameras."
"The world is safe now."
"To him and his copy."
"If you have a lot of money, it's different."
"I swear to God I don't."
"It's better than I thought."
"You may have heard of him."
"I understand, Reverend, and I apologize."
"Dinner is in an hour."
"It looks like meth, but it's very white."
"But a soldier we can use."
"He said he has powerful friends."
"Please be careful when picking it up."
"I can explain everything that happened."
"Because that's what the company wants."
"There is a sign on the door."
"Above American feelings."
"It's better if you don't know him."
"The whole airport already knows."
"The truth is that neither do I."
"The nearest road is over there."
"The gods are on your side."
"You have taken my bite away."
"I think he does a good job."
"Search the database."
"It was about four meters high."
"Wow, it almost sounds serious this time."
"These people will bring you to see me."
"Welcome to heaven, you sons of bitches."
"I tried to be fair to you creatures."
"Suddenly I'm glad to be back."
"I'll let you get back to your papers."
"Someone has to take care of you."
"It's the best part of the day."
"That's cutting-edge medical technology."
"At one, at two."
"Please get me the police."
"And then, on to what follows."
"What happened was an accident."
"This is your driver's license."
"Nobody knows better than you."
"Well, you're on the right flight."
"And your sister is very smart."
"This is something new for me."
"Open your eyes and aim there."
"I thought we could search in style."
"What you have is a gift."
"There is a storm inside us."
"There's someone who wants to talk to you."
"Do what the boy says."
"For over a year now."
"All I did was cooperate."
"You're a good person, but listen."
"People will pay to see this."
"It's something related to consciousness."
"You take care of the distribution."
"Then I'll take you home."
"A little bit of this and that."
"It's always better when it doesn't rain."
"I'm going to put you on speakerphone."
"I already read it in a book."
"If you know anything, I'll be home."
"In the world of the rich."
"I'll make the next roof blue."
"This is bigger than us."
"I want to know if they are in Paris."
"You are the tip of the spear."
"I thought we were in this together."
"We'll go to town to have fun."
"I won an excellence scholarship."
"Sudden manifestation of a great truth."

"But it's much more than that."
"He is at peace with the world."
"At least I've been good for something."
"I'm going with the kids."
"I have a friend who is a guard."
"I took a detour so I could think."
"Then I'll tell you."
"Please don't get up anymore."
"I want to do something in life."
"You have to think about the girl."
"Look, there was a shoe print."
"You are a very, very lucky girl."
"I want to see you open your eyes."
"I know their catalogue almost by heart."
"It's what people want."
"It's just that I was late."
"That's not what I saw."
"And now you are a great hero."
"You should have told me about the operation."
"Time has been changing it."
"I liked having sex with him."
"My son is a good boy."
"It hasn't changed one bit."
"I don't think anyone knows."
"Yes, it's the same as your ring."
"He is thinking of moving to Rome."
"I'll tell you when you're older."
"It'll only take a second, really."
"It's much more important than that."
"Let's see the circus freaks."
"And five minutes of your time."
"I know he's in town."
"You're doing great, darling."
"The trajectory must be correct."
"Luckily, he had a twin brother."
"It wasn't the war they started."
"It's a good night for that."
"He has opened my mind."
"I am the Gingerbread Man."
"And this is the exciting part."
"There was a tall man, a priest."
"Look, I ask and you answer."
"But everything will be okay."
"That's just your opinion."
"Clear as the blue sky, brother."
"And I envy you for that."
"Now I have a different task for you."
"We are closer to the other side."
"I forgot until I saw this."
"I think he is at home."
"I think we need to reconsider drugs."
"You're going to be okay this time."
"I received a tape from my mom."
"But that was last year."
"Tell him the whole story."
"The proof is in the eyes."
"So we still have a chance."
"You understand the laws of nature."
"The same as with any meal."
"It's been a shitty day."
"It's the nature of the beast."
"I know the map exists."
"Men who want to take back their country."
"The police are coming. We must go."
"What do you want with me?"
"I'm waiting for a very important call."
"That book gives him an alibi."
"I promised his wife."
"You are very kind to say so."
"Yes, it may reach that speed."
"The mummy only has one eye."
"My schedule just freed up."
"I'll cut a bunch for you."
"I'll make you second in command."
"Think about it over the weekend."
"Now I have to go to work."
"That's what I want to change."
"The white is on the ceiling."
"But everything else was different?"
"This is our security center."
"He was from the royal family."
"Or so he said."
"We should at least go see."
"Find something worth my time."
"Today is our wedding anniversary."
"They'll let us in when they're sure."
"You said whatever I wanted."
"I think that's a yes."
"I'm glad you see it that way."
"Captain, a message for the Dauphin."
"I'm changing your biology grade."
"It's the best thing you've ever done."
"Even if it's on the last day."
"To talk about it, to think about it."
"It would still put on a good show."
"Finder keepser."
"Now it's time for your half."
"Your whole planet was blown to bits."
"It was in ninety-six."
"Faithful as a hunting dog."
"In the kitchen cupboard."
"I can do it with my eyes closed."
"Thank you for bringing them early."
"I bought a second-hand one."
"In a house in the hills."
"The skin is worth some money."
"Dinner is in the fridge."
"I don't want to talk about that now."
"The end is full of traps."
"I hope you find your son."
"I guess I'll see you around."
"I think we can find something in between."
"It's not good for business."

"We must leave here quickly."
"It can be changed, you know that."
"Give me leeway, I know this man."
"I'm going back to the console."
"I have to protect my health insurance."
"The truck. We have a possible resurrection."
"Girls like that."
"I would call that the main theme."
"I really look forward to hearing from you."
"Boys, be careful with the paintings."
"I thought you were one of them."
"I left you at the party."
"I've seen that look many times."
"It is very common with dogs."
"This is the source of the water."
"Once again, once again."
"At dinner time."
"Maybe I've never done it before."
"She is worth more than the mother."
"That's why we keep talking."
"Who can pray all night."
"Maybe he's coming home."
"Open your mouth and eat this."
"They say this was called a highway."
"He only kept one."
"Concentrate, shout everything you see."
"I have never seen a white light."
"Like a shadow in the night."
"I really loved that mare."
"People know you and talk to you."
"I can see right through you."
"That's our meeting point."
"You can use the bathroom in the garage."
"He who speaks at funerals."
"Then you will be able to see your friend."
"I have a son that age."
"Should we think about obeying the order?"
"He was talented, he had a good eye."
"It belonged to my great-uncle."
"Mom has to go to work."
"Let's get out of here, boy."
"And many more are on the way."
"Hold on a little longer, you can do it."
"You're going without air brakes."
"That's what some people say, yes."
"Take your torches, return to camp."
"Our friend acted on his own."
"They have all the men they need."
"That's my toothbrush."
"Not that it's ever worked."
"We won't be here, but you'll see him."
"It's better than starving to death."
"It's like a drug to me."
"I've told you this many times."
"I believe it, I believe it."
"The fairy tale is over."
"I wish he had more time left."
"I'm going back to your house."
"I'd better talk to him."
"Now it is an amusement park."
"I don't know anything about those things."
"It's two days away from here."
"My sincere condolences to your husband."
"And that's where we're going to go."
"Your madness matches mine."
"The black sheep of the family."
"I have to go to my meeting."
"I'm going to take you back."
"Only I have understood his secret."

"We're going to the winner's place."
"You are a strong and independent woman."
"I don't think this is working."
"Hurry, before it closes."
"Your daughter and her family arrived."
"Late spring, early summer."
"Everything is fine, dad is here."
"One is yours, one is mine."
"But we both know it is."
"Whatever it is, it's warm."
"Nobody knows whether to stay or leave."

"If he's smart, he's learned his lesson."
"I have a question about the container."
"This has to be my room."
"I don't think he knows anything."
"Someone or something is causing this."
"All you do is talk."
"Nobody is going to call anybody."
"Sir, they are your most loyal customers."
"Today is a very important day."

"It's what I've always done."
"I will teach you how to prepare my recipe."
"I went to your office once."
"That only happens in movies."
"Now it's not going to be possible."
"I see what they're doing."
"I thought the same thing about you."
"We have done everything we could."
"Everyone was looking for the girls."
"Be in the middle and endure."
"It's better to keep it between us."
"We take it very seriously."
"I thought you didn't believe in God."
"The truth is that it is."
"I want you to try to focus on me."
"But not for me, of course."
"I have to go away for a few days."
"I had never been to this event."
"Please continue with the lesson."
"And now they make us hunt shadows."
"You are good at what you do."
"I have to ask you to come with me."
"Most people consider what they say."
"I'll tell him on the porch."
"That will give us the necessary information."
"You're going to be able to get your head back."
"It's just a matter of a minute."
"I like things with an edge."
"They all have one thing in common."

"You will go to the scene of the accident."
"Neither here nor anywhere else."
"But his voice is very tense."
"I'll start on the north side."
"They were just a couple of models."
"I thought that was what you wanted."
"You seem to know a lot about me."
"He has this little girl waiting for him at home."
"In case you remember anything."
"They are in the waiting room."
"The mission meant everything to him."
"I'll take my wallet just in case."
"You said this was confidential."
"It will be the flight of the stars."
"I want to know who feeds that account."
"You and I won't make trash."
"Yes, I have his family here."
"You're just a little girl."

"Alpha Team will return to the Pit."
"I get a good picture and transmission."
"I would go as far away as possible."
"I just suggested that she get married."
"What store or what eight rooms."
"That was all he did."
"Leave your message after the tone."
"You just needed to see it for yourself."
"If so, that's me."
"Black people should have another chair."
"That's a coup d'état."
"I felt like a military engineer."
"It refers to the urn, genius."
"I don't have time for that now."
"I want to know what happened here."
"I told him to stay there."
"She was fine two hours ago."
"I never thought I'd see this day."
"You go to the party for her."
"Yes, and he had a rag."
"That's what she would want."
"I've been in this life for a long time."
"You have to ask me the right questions."
"My dear boy, of course not."
"This man wants what you want."
"As if it had all been yesterday."
"Every victory of yours is a challenge."
"If I become dinner."
"Let's go talk to your operator."

"You talk as if you've been there."
"The architect only made the drawings."
"No one will look for us on a train."
"They will do what I tell them."
"But I'm still able to see."
"I've lived there all my life."
"I have the weekend free."
"That scammer who wears African clothes."
"I'm done playing with this one."
"He's down there with his people."
"You gave life and took it away."
"I'll do the same for fun."
"At ten in the morning."
"I can't, sorry, I can't."
"I'm sure he's here."
"In the belly of the beast."
"A place without language or streets."
"You're going to need more than that."
"Yes, I know what you mean."
"Well, that's the most important thing."
"We'll have to close for a while."
"The entire US government"
"Man, you're really messing it up."
"My son wants his first car."
"I bought it a long time ago, by mail."
"That's me with my mother."
"You are not a collector's item."
"He has to be at home."
"They are looking for you, my dear friend."
"I've known you since you were little."
"My number is on the boots."
"It's easy to say, it's a hat."
"Do everything he tells you."
"It must have been with some team."
"It's like a spell book."
"And I told him you were coming."
"But I have to do something first."
"Only in all the little things."
"As if I were in heaven."
"This is a place of business."
"But there's something I have to tell you."
"I am willing to do whatever it takes."
"They received the letter and another code."
"This is child's play."
"I guess it's part of the job."
"I know someone who knows."
"I just found out this morning."
"Glue strips of paper to the fan."
"I don't think there is any."
"It has to be, you chose her."
"That was what I was looking for."
"I mean, look around you."
"Not if the story is correct."
"You'll have to have dinner somewhere."
"I think this proves our theory."
"Straight ahead and to the left."
"Now I get leads from everywhere."
"Or, if you prefer, you can say 'our'."
"Now do what I tell you."
"So far I've been the only ones speaking."
"Seventy-five, fifty-one."
"I believe that the work of God."
"I don't think it's worth it."
"Everyone likes it."
"The prophet returns to his throne."
"I feel the same way about you."
"This is the prettiest room."
"The cannon is offline."
"I've thought about what you said."
"You know how mothers are."
"We were lucky in the first round."
"It's my decision, not yours."
"Upstairs in the billiard room."
"And a pair of black gloves."
"It will look fabulous either way."
"They both live in the same city."
"I understand that you are under a lot of pressure."

"It's one of my favorite places."
"Now everything is going to be okay."
"They are all songs about the same thing."
"You've done well, old friend."
"Look at all he's done."
"I haven't seen her for days."
"But now it's not going to come."
"I'm glad to hear your voice."
"And here I put a happy face."
"I'll do it another way for you."
"It's clearly full of black magic."
"As if it had exploded from within."
"Next candidate for human trials."
"My father won the real war."
"You have to go after what you want."
"I just want to see what he'll do."

"Today is my wedding anniversary."
"A series of events have occurred."

"Only when I give you an order."
"I am proud to be your father."
"Please tell me you understand."
"It's a figure of speech, sir."
"Please state the nature of your emergency."

"I just want to see my son."
"I've already made that decision."
"I sang to my baby."
"Every night, in front of the mirror."
"Now you know how things are."
"I received a call and a request."
"That makes your daddy very proud."

"Wait until I tell you."
"I'm nothing but red six."
"I did what I liked."
"Please open that door, darling."
"They live in a fantasy world."
"Others receive more than we do."

"The world's wars had begun."
"You think it, he does it."
"You are living what you always dreamed of."

"Operator, I need an outside line, please."
"I do it as fast as I can."
"I'll have to tell them you were here."
"The doctor said he was fine."
"Well, the last one who spoke did."

"Pilots to the takeoff deck."
"Since then, this is my life."
"Thank you, you said someone, not something."
"I told you she was a woman."
"Please, there, on the table."
"Oh, it's the meteorite guy."
"A little, his boss is Japanese."
"Not until I say so."
"That's why I brought her home."
"French, Americans, it's all the same."
"Brother, you are far from well."
"I know, but this is different."
"The woman is still in the area."

"That's what I need now."
"My mother wanted to leave the country."
"Dreams do come true."
"This is how I do things."
"Alive, moving and unknown."

"Only then would I allow you to leave."
"Just once and nothing more."
"But that's what I was thinking."
"They have their whole lives ahead of them."
"We lived together and decided to come together."
"A young lady arrived to see you."
"An exact image of his mind."
"By my mother's grave."
"Keep your eyes on the wheat."

"They pulled it clean out of his skull."
"Go to the middle page."
"I need the subject to study nursing."
"Because I have been convicted twice."
"I know a lot about these things."

"Like many of ours."
"They have each other."
"You and the earth are one."
"Please walk on the grass."
"You must do what you think is right."
"On parole on the way home."

"I want you to mean it."
"The same way as before."
"We move as fast as we can."
"Move your car off the road."
"And now they're looking for you."
"My daughter, you need to rest and relax."
"This is what I was talking about."
"With a fast car, you can get there."
"I'm so happy for both of you."
"As if you were part of me."
"You were right about your brother."
"Today is our lucky day."

"Open the door and let me out."
"I'll keep it, boss."
"Stay in the bathroom if you want."
"And three weeks later we came."
"That was my sales pitch."
"Your parents must be very proud."
"At one time we thought so."
"And you've always eaten them fresh."
"And so I agreed to go with him."
"I think we've already been introduced."
"That virtue was its own reward."
"He is the best man in the world."
"It is the time of men."
"I have never met that man."
"But things happened to her."
"I've been thinking about a lot of things."
"I was hoping you would be welcomed."
"Everyone to the launch bay."
"I know how much you want this."
"Let's see how these children are."
"I just wanted to tell you that you were right."
