The word '그들이에요' is a contraction of '그들' (which means 'they' as a pronoun) and '이에요' (a copular verb). Therefore, it should be analyzed such that '그들' is identified as a PRON and '이에요' is analyzed as AUX or VERB, with their respective base forms being '그들' and '이다'. I will separate it into two different tokens for better analysis.\n\nCorrecting these should represent the sentence more accurately in terms of linguistic analysis.","2. tokens":[{"text":"저게","whitespace":" ","pos":"PRON","lemma":"저것"},{"text":"그들","whitespace":"","pos":"PRON","lemma":"그들"},{"text":"이에요","whitespace":"","pos":"AUX","lemma":"이다"},{"text":".","whitespace":"","pos":"PUNCT","lemma":"."}]}}

The accurate morphological breakdown is that the base form for '갈거예요' should relate back to '가다', which means 'to go'. The analysis for '지금' is correct as it means 'now', and the period '.' has been correctly analyzed as punctuation.

Therefore, it should be split into '스피드' as the noun and '를' separately as a particle, with '스피드' as the lemma of the noun. The main issue is with '되찾아야해요', which should be split morphologically: '되어야 하다' is an auxiliary construction meaning 'must do', combined with a verb form of '되찾다' (to recover).
