["er",{"thoughts":"Final –er can behave two different ways: most infinitive-verb spellings drop the R and sound like a pure closed “ay,” but some nouns/adjectives keep the R and use an open “eh” plus the French throaty R. English speakers must remember when the R disappears and when to growl it.","pattern":"er","position":"End","description":"At the end of a word, –er is usually pronounced as a pure closed /e/ (similar to the vowel in English “say” but shorter and without the glide), and the final R is silent: parler → “par-lay.”  However, in some shorter words (often two syllables) the R stays, giving an open /ɛ/ plus the French guttural R: hiver → “ee-vair.”  The French R is made in the back of the throat, not with the tongue tip like English.","familiarity":"MaybeAlreadyKnows","difficulty":"Medium","example_words":[{"target":"parler","native":"parler","position":"End","cultural_context":"Heard in the tourist phrase “Parlez-vous français?”"},{"target":"manger","native":"manger","position":"End","cultural_context":"Common verb on French menus or in language apps meaning ‘to eat’"},{"target":"hiver","native":"hiver","position":"End","cultural_context":"Shows up in fashion terms like “collection hiver” and French weather reports"}]}]
["ez",{"thoughts":"French -ez endings are almost always pronounced as the single vowel /e/, a pure “ay” sound with no English-style diphthong.  The written z is silent unless the word is immediately followed by another word that starts with a vowel sound, in which case the z is linked and pronounced /z/ (liaison).  English speakers know the vowel but may diphthongise it or forget the possible /z/ in liaison.","pattern":"ez","position":"End","description":"Usually pronounced like the first part of the English word “say” but shorter and steadier (/e/).

["es",{"thoughts":"Final ‑S in French is normally silent, so the key question is whether the preceding E is pronounced. In tiny function words like “les / des / mes” it is pronounced /e/ (close to the English long A in “day,” but held pure—no off-glide). In most other words the whole “es” is silent, it just marks a plural; you hear only the consonant right before it (baguette → baguettes /baˈgɛt/). English speakers already know the long A sound and are used to silent final letters, but they must remember not to turn /e/ into a diphthong and not to add a voiced S.","pattern":"es","position":"End","description":"At the end of a word, “es” behaves in two main ways:\n1. In short function words (les, des, mes, ces, ses, tes) it is pronounced /e/ – like the vowel in English “day” but without the y-glide.\n2.

["x",{"thoughts":"English speakers expect final “x” to sound like /ks/ (as in “box”). In French, that never happens: most of the time the final x is completely silent, and in a handful of short number-words (six, dix) it is pronounced like a soft /s/. During liaison before a following vowel, the sound can become /z/, but that is an advanced point.","pattern":"x","position":"End","description":"At the very end of a French word, the letter “x” is usually silent (Bordeaux ➜ “bor-DOH”). In a few short words—mainly numbers such as six, dix—it is pronounced like the English /s/ (“seece”).

["s",{"thoughts":"English speakers know the /s/ sound very well. The only challenge is realizing that a written final “s” in French is usually silent, but can sometimes be pronounced /s/ (and turns into /z/ in a liaison). The mouth position is exactly the same as the English unvoiced “s” in “see.” The difficulty is therefore remembering when to say it, not how to say it.","pattern":"s","position":"End","description":"When an “s” is written at the very end of a French word it is MOST OFTEN silent (Paris ➜ ‘pa-REE’). A few short everyday words keep the clear /s/ sound (bus ➜ ‘büss’). If the next word begins with a vowel, the normally silent “s” can link to it and be voiced /z/ (les‿amis ➜ ‘lay-zah-MEE’), but on its own it is silent.

["t",{"thoughts":"English speakers know the /t/ sound well, but French spelling rules often make the final written “t” silent, which can confuse them. The main hurdle is remembering when to drop the sound and when to keep it (usually pronounced in a consonant cluster like –st or in many imported/technical terms, but silent after a lone vowel).","pattern":"t","position":"End","description":"When the letter “t” is the very last letter of a French word, it is usually NOT pronounced (ballet → “bal-lay”). However, if that “t” is part of a consonant cluster such as –st or appears in many newer technical/foreign words, it is pronounced as a clear, unaspirated /t/—lighter than the puffier English final /t/.

["d",{"thoughts":"English speakers know the printed letter “d,” but French treats a final d very differently: it’s usually silent, sometimes turns into a /t/ with liaison, and only occasionally keeps the voiced /d/. Learners must remember “don’t say the d” unless a special case applies.","pattern":"d","position":"End","description":"At the end of a French word, the letter d is almost always silent: the word ends abruptly with the preceding vowel or consonant (grahn, not grand). If the next word begins with a vowel and liaison is required, the silent d re-surfaces but as an unvoiced /t/ (grand hôtel ➜ grahn-to-tel). A handful of short words and proper names keep the voiced /d/ you know from English (sud, David).

The main challenge is deciding when to pronounce it at all.","pattern":"p","position":"End","description":"At the end of a word, written “p” is USUALLY silent in French (e.g. coup ➜ /ku/).

["g",{"thoughts":"English speakers know the hard /g/ sound, but they don’t expect the letter to become silent.

The main challenge is remembering to drop the sound in most cases.","pattern":"g","position":"End","description":"At the very end of a French word, “g” is usually silent. The vowel right before it is pronounced normally or nasalized (e.g., on → ɔ̃).
