["ㅌ",{"thoughts":"Word-final ㅌ is basically an English /t/ that is held (unreleased). English already has an unreleased /t/ in “cat‿nap”, so the concept is familiar, but learners forget to cut the air completely. Main challenge is remembering to stop the puff of air.","pattern":"ㅌ","position":"End","description":"When ㅌ is the final consonant in a Korean syllable (batchim), it is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar stop that is completely shut and NOT released: tongue tip touches the ridge just behind your upper teeth, you stop the airflow, and you do NOT let out the little burst of air you would in an English word like “tight.” It is very similar to the way many Americans say the /t/ at the end of “cat” before a pause: tongue stays in place, no audible burst.","familiarity":"LikelyAlreadyKnows","difficulty":"Medium","example_words":[{"target":"맛","native":"taste; flavor","position":"End","cultural_context":"Appears on Korean snack labels and menus (e.g., “치즈맛” = cheese flavor) often shown in K-food videos watched by English speakers."},{"target":"같다","native":"to be the same","position":"End","cultural_context":"Common verb you’ll meet in K-drama subtitles and K-pop lyric translations, so many learners have already seen or heard it."}]}]
["ㅂ",{"thoughts":"In Korean, when ㅂ sits at the very end of a syllable or word it loses any audible burst; the lips simply close and no puff of air follows. English does this in casual speech with the unreleased final p in words like “stop” or “keep,” so the physical action is familiar, though learners may need reminding not to add a little vowel after it.","pattern":"ㅂ","position":"End","description":"At the end of a word ㅂ is pronounced as an unreleased, unaspirated p-sound. Close your lips as if saying the English letter P, but do NOT let any air burst out and do NOT voice the sound. Simply stop the airflow by sealing the lips and move on to the next sound or finish the word.","familiarity":"LikelyAlreadyKnows","difficulty":"Medium","example_words":[{"target":"bibimbap","native":"비빔밥","position":"End","cultural_context":"Well-known Korean mixed-rice dish found on many restaurant menus worldwide"},{"target":"kimbap","native":"김밥","position":"End","cultural_context":"Popular Korean seaweed rice roll often compared to sushi and sold in Korean eateries"}]}]
["ㅎ",{"thoughts":"The final ㅎ is basically the same breathy “h” English speakers already know, but in Korean it is clipped very short or may only be a slight exhalation with no vocal-cord vibration. Because English rarely puts an “h” sound at the very end of a syllable, learners recognize the sound but are unsure how forcefully to release it.","pattern":"ㅎ","position":"End","description":"When ㅎ is the last consonant in a Korean syllable (batchim position), simply open the throat and let a small puff of air escape without voicing—like starting to say “h” and then stopping immediately. Do NOT add a vowel after it. The mouth stays relaxed; just let a quick breath out and cut it off.","familiarity":"LikelyAlreadyKnows","difficulty":"Medium","example_words":[{"target":"huh","native":"huh","position":"End","cultural_context":"Everyday English interjection expressing confusion; ends in a clipped breathy h"},{"target":"uh-huh","native":"uh-huh","position":"Multiple","cultural_context":"Common English informal way to say “yes”; each syllable finishes with the same short h puff"},{"target":"meh","native":"meh","position":"End","cultural_context":"Internet slang for indifference; speakers already end the word with a brief, almost voiceless h"}]}]
