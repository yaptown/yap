             Typical review session: get_due_cards, then for each card quiz the user \
             (get_sentences can supply an example sentence that the user should fully \
             understand), then log_review with an honest rating.\n\
             \n\
             Words are identified by (language, gram), where a gram is the exact token \
             sequence — word + lemma + part of speech — returned by search_dictionary and \
             get_due_cards. Pass those objects back verbatim; the server rejects anything \
             that doesn't name a real dictionary entry. To add new words: search_dictionary \
             first, show the user what you found, then pass the matches' language + gram to \
             add_cards.\n\
             \n\
             search and fetch are a standard browse/cite pair over the public dictionary at \
             yap.town/d/ — use them to look up and cite entries; use search_dictionary when \
             you need exact grams for the deck tools.\n\
             \n\
             When the interactive widgets are available, prefer them for quizzing, and pick \
             the one the yap app would use: present_translation for a written card the user \
             has seen before (the user translates a corpus sentence containing the word; the \
             server autogrades and logs it), and present_card for new cards, listening \
             cards, pronunciation cards, and words present_translation says have no \
             comprehensible sentence yet (a card the user grades themselves). Never call \
             log_review or \
             grade_translation for a card you presented — the widget logs the review and \
             the outcome is reported back to you."
