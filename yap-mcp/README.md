# yap-mcp

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes a yap.town account to chat
clients: do reviews, add words, look things up in the dictionary, pull
comprehensible example sentences, and check stats — all backed by the same
event stream the web app syncs, so everything shows up across devices.

One binary, two modes:

- `yap-mcp` (or `yap-mcp stdio`) — stdio server for local clients (Claude
  Code/Desktop), bound to one account via env vars and the service role key.
- `yap-mcp serve` — remote server (streamable HTTP + OAuth 2.1) usable as a
  claude.ai custom connector; multi-user, each user signs in with their own
  yap credentials.

## Tools

Cards are identified by `(language, gram)`, where a gram is the token sequence
— word + lemma + part of speech — plus a sense number, identifying a specific
sense of a word (it's exactly what deck events store). Tools that take grams or cards
validate them by interning against the language pack **and** checking
membership in the master frequency list — the rodeos intern more than real
entries, so the dictionary is the real check. Anything that doesn't name a
real course entry is rejected; the server never guesses.

- `search_dictionary` — find words/phrases; returns each word's `language`,
  `display_text`, `is_phrase`, and `senses` (each with `gram`, `gloss`,
  `frequency_rank`, `in_deck`, and `definition`). Pass the word's language and
  the chosen sense's gram to deck tools.
- `add_cards` — add words to the deck as flashcards, by `(language, gram)`.
- `get_due_cards` — list due cards; each entry carries its `language` + `card`
  object to pass back to `log_review`.
- `log_review` — record a review result (`again`/`hard`/`good`/`easy`/`remembered`).
  Appends a real `ReviewCard` event, so FSRS scheduling updates for real.
- `get_sentences` — example sentences containing a gram, with translations and
  source attribution (Anki/Tatoeba/manual/songs/movies): a
  `comprehensible_sentences` list otherwise composed only of words the user
  knows, and an `other_sentences` list sampled from everything containing the
  gram regardless of difficulty.
- `unlock_cards` — release the next batch from lockup (the app's "review N
   more cards" offer), via the deck's own `get_release_offer`; reviewing a
   locked card also unlocks it. `get_due_cards` reports `cards_in_lockup`.
- `get_stats` — streak, XP, review counts, deck size, tier, recent days.
- `present_card` — renders one gram as an interactive MCP Apps flashcard
   widget (the word with audio, reveal, grade buttons); the widget logs the
   user's own grade via `log_review` and reports the outcome into model
   context. Degrades to a polite error when the widget isn't built.
- `present_translation` — renders a sentence-translation challenge for a
   written-gram card, mirroring the app: the user translates a comprehensible
   corpus sentence containing the word, the widget submits to
   `grade_translation`, and every word in the sentence gets reviewed. The
   model may pass the exact text of a corpus sentence from `get_sentences`;
   omitted, the server picks the app's own least-reviewed comprehensible
   sentence.
- `grade_translation` — widget-only (`ui.visibility: ["app"]`): autogrades
   the user's typed translation (AI backend `/autograde-translation`, with
   the app's exact-match short-circuit and heuristic fallback), logs the
   `TranslationChallenge` deck event, and returns per-word grades plus the
   closest accepted translation.
- `get_audio` — widget-only (`ui.visibility: ["app"]`): resolves audio the
   same way the app does (human voice-actor recording from the language pack
   first — shared `human_audio` registry — then TTS via the AI backend) and
   returns base64 + attribution.
- `search` / `fetch` — the standard browse/cite pair (required by ChatGPT for
  deep research and connector validation). `search` returns dictionary entry
  pages as `{id, title, url}`; `fetch` takes an `id`
  (`"<course-slug>:<frequency-index>"`) and returns the entry as readable
  text with a citable `url` into the public dictionary at `yap.town/d/`, plus
  each sense's exact gram in `metadata.senses[].gram`. Words use their most
  frequent defined sense's frequency index as the id; fetching any member
  sense's index returns the whole word. URLs are best-effort: colliding display texts
  get a numeric suffix at site build time we can't reproduce, so rare
  homographs may 404 (sampled hit rate: 39/39).

All tools carry MCP annotations (`title`, `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`,
etc.), which both the Anthropic and OpenAI directories require.

## How it works

Events are fetched from Supabase at startup (and re-fetched lazily every ~20s)
and replayed natively through `yap-frontend-rs` — the same deck logic the web
app runs in WASM. Writes append events under the device id `yap-mcp` and POST
them to `/rest/v1/events` in the exact shape the web app uses; other devices
pick them up on their next sync.

## Setup

Requires the language pack `.rkyv` files in `out/` (committed via LFS) and the
repo root `.env` containing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

Environment:

- `YAP_USER_EMAIL` (required) — the account to operate on
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (required) — read from the repo `.env` automatically
- `SUPABASE_URL` (optional) — defaults to production
- `YAP_OUT_DIR` (optional) — defaults to `<repo>/out`

Build and register with a client, e.g. Claude Code:

```bash
cargo build --release -p yap-mcp
claude mcp add yap --env YAP_USER_EMAIL=you@example.com -- /path/to/yap/target/release/yap-mcp
```

Startup takes a few seconds (event fetch + ~130 MB language pack load); the
pack stays resident for the life of the process.

## Remote server (claude.ai custom connector)

`yap-mcp serve` serves the same tools over streamable HTTP at `/mcp`, wrapped
in an OAuth 2.1 flow that claude.ai's "add custom connector" understands:
RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata → RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata
→ RFC 7591 dynamic client registration → PKCE (S256) authorization-code flow
→ token + refresh.

The OAuth layer is a thin shim over Supabase auth:

- `/oauth/authorize` parks the client's request and redirects to
  `yap.town/connect`, where the user signs in with their normal yap auth
  (same domain, so future passkeys work) and approves. The frontend posts
  proof back to `/oauth/approve`, which mints the connector a **fresh**
  Supabase session (admin generate_link + verify — reusing the browser's
  session would entangle two devices in one refresh-token rotation family)
  and hands back the redirect with a single-use authorization code. The
  frontend hardcodes which MCP origins it will send proof to.
- Tokens are MCP-scoped: we mint our own JWTs (`aud: yap-mcp`), with the
  user's Supabase session embedded **encrypted** (ChaCha20-Poly1305, key
  derived from `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`). The OAuth client never holds a raw
  Supabase credential — a leaked token is only usable against `/mcp` here,
  and raw Supabase JWTs are rejected. Refresh decrypts the embedded Supabase
  refresh token and proxies to Supabase. Still no token store.
- Client registrations are encoded as signed `client_id`s (the redirect URIs
  live inside the signature), so server restarts don't break connections. The
  only in-memory OAuth state is in-flight authorization codes — which is why
  the deployment pins a single always-on machine.
- All Supabase reads/writes happen as the user themself (anon apikey + user
  JWT), inside row-level security. The remote server never touches the
  service role key.

Per-user deck state is initialized lazily on first tool call (event fetch +
replay) and cached; language packs load lazily per course and are shared
across users.

Env: `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (required),
`YAP_MCP_BASE_URL` (public URL, used in metadata and Host validation),
`YAP_FRONTEND_URL` (where /connect lives), `YAP_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (extra Host
values, e.g. the fly.dev name behind the proxy), `PORT`, `SUPABASE_URL`,
`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `YAP_OUT_DIR`.

The public domain `mcp.yap.town` is a Cloudflare Worker pass-through to
`yap-mcp.fly.dev` (`proxy-worker/`; deploy with `wrangler deploy` from that
directory). The worker approach exists because attaching a Workers custom
domain auto-provisions DNS + TLS without needing Fly-side certificates.

Deploy on Fly (first time: `flyctl launch --no-deploy --copy-config --config
yap-mcp/fly.toml`, then set the secret):

```bash
flyctl secrets set --config yap-mcp/fly.toml SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=...
flyctl deploy --config yap-mcp/fly.toml
```

Then in claude.ai: Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → URL
`https://mcp.yap.town/mcp`. Claude discovers the OAuth endpoints, opens the
yap login page, and connects.

## Current limitations

- stdio mode's auth is service-role + email (fine for personal/local use);
  serve mode is the multi-user path.
- Approval uses whatever auth the yap.town frontend supports (today email +
  password; passkeys would work there when added).
- Listening cards can be quizzed only as text in a chat client.
- No challenge generation (translation/transcription exercises) yet; the chat
  LLM is expected to quiz the user itself, e.g. using `get_sentences`.
- **Run exactly one server process per account.** All processes write events
  under the shared `yap-mcp` device id, so a second concurrent writer corrupts
  the per-device event-index sequence and silently drops events (see the
  single-writer note in `src/sync.rs`). The deploy job holds the remote server
  to one instance — `flyctl deploy --ha=false` then `flyctl scale count 1`
  (`min_machines_running` only keeps that one machine warm; it's not the cap).
  So the realistic ways to get two writers are a manual `fly scale count > 1` or
  two concurrent stdio sessions for one account — don't. It's not a hard
  guarantee (that would need an exclusivity lease, e.g. a Postgres advisory
  lock), but the residual window is narrow and the harm self-corrects (a lost
  review comes due again). In-flight OAuth codes and MCP sessions are also
  in-memory, which is the other reason to stay single-instance.
- Only synced state survives a restart. Per-user deck state is rebuilt by
  re-fetching and replaying events from Supabase, but the unsynced tail can't
  be — a review/addition/unlock whose upload failed lives only in memory (as
  does the idempotency cache, which starts empty). It's retried on the next
  call, but lost if the process exits or the per-user state is evicted first. A
  lost review just comes due again; a lost `add_cards`/`unlock_cards` means
  those cards aren't added/unlocked until redone. If it matters, the fix is
  durable local storage for the unsynced tail.
- Public OAuth endpoints are rate-limited per client IP (fixed 60s windows);
  cached per-user deck state is evicted after 6h idle.

## Review widget (MCP Apps)

`widget/` is a small Vite/React app that reuses yap-frontend components
verbatim (AudioButton, shadcn ui, theme) via aliases; shims keep the 4 MiB
WASM out (`src/shims/`). Build with `pnpm install && pnpm build` in
`yap-mcp/widget/` — the server loads `widget/dist/index.html` at runtime
(`YAP_WIDGET_HTML` overrides the path) and serves it as
`ui://yap/review.html` (`text/html;profile=mcp-app`) with a fully closed
CSP: the widget talks only through the host bridge (`get_audio`,
`log_review`, `updateModelContext`). CI builds it before the Docker image;
a server without the file just runs text-only.

## Directory review account

Reviewers for the Anthropic/OpenAI directories get the throwaway account
`yap-mcp-test@popovit.ch` (see `smoke/`). To reset and re-populate it with a
believable deck and review history:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
YAP_TEST_USER_PASSWORD=<reviewer password> python3 yap-mcp/smoke/setup_test_user.py
YAP_USER_EMAIL=yap-mcp-test@popovit.ch python3 yap-mcp/smoke/seed_test_user.py target/debug/yap-mcp
```

Public docs for end users live at `yap.town/mcp`; privacy policy at
`yap.town/privacy`.

## When Supabase moves to asymmetric signing keys

The current setup verifies user access tokens and signs/encrypts our own MCP
tokens with the shared `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`. Migration is mechanical, and the
`generate_link` session-minting is unaffected:

1. Verify Supabase user tokens via the project JWKS (RS256/ES256) instead of
   the HS256 secret (`verify_supabase_token`).
2. Introduce a dedicated `MCP_TOKEN_SECRET` for signing our access/refresh
   tokens (`issue_tokens`, `verify_access_token`, `verify_refresh_token`) —
   they were only ever verified by us.
3. Derive the session-encryption key from that same new secret
   (`RemoteApp::new`). Existing connections re-authorize once.
