{"sentence":"나 타이타닉이 좋아!","issues":["Missing topic particle on '나' (should be '나는' in standard Korean) or a comma for contrastive '나,' in casual style.","Particle mismatch: having both '나' (subject/topic) and '타이타닉이' (nominative marker) is awkward—use object marker '을' with 좋아하다 or make 타이타닉 the subject with '이'.","Verb form/register: '좋아' is casual descriptive; learners should see the more common transitive form '좋아해' when saying 'I like X.'"],"corrected_sentence":"나는 타이타닉을 좋아해!"}
{"sentence":"많이 사람이 있었어.","issues":["Incorrect use of 많이 directly before the noun 사람 (많이 is an adverb, not a prenominal modifier).","Word order/choice error — should use 많은 사람이 있었어, 사람이 많았어, or 사람이 많이 있었어."],"corrected_sentence":"사람이 많았어."}
{"sentence":"다른 예를 드세요.","issues":["Incorrect verb phrase: '예를 드세요' is not standard. The correct verb is '예를 들다' (often used with 주다/드리다: '예를 들어(서) 주세요' or '예를 들어 드리세요').","Minor ambiguity in politeness: you can use '주세요', '드리세요', or '주십시오' depending on level; choose one appropriate to context."],"corrected_sentence":"다른 예를 들어 주세요."}
{"sentence":"내가 너무 말을 많이 하고 있어?","issues":["Unnatural placement of '너무' before '말을' — more natural is '말을 너무 많이'.","Slight redundancy/awkwardness from having both '너무' and '많이' in that order; may confuse learners about modifier placement.","Casual alternatives exist (e.g., '내가 말 너무 많이 해?') which learners might prefer."],"corrected_sentence":"내가 말을 너무 많이 하고 있어?"}
