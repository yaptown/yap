"What does that make you?"
"And what did she say?"
"Yes, that's what she said."
"I'll see what I can do."

"Where did you find that?"
"You know what you have to do."
"Do you know what he told me?"
"Is that all you know how to do?"
"Is that all you can do?"
"I'll see what I can find."
"I don't know, but I'll find out."
"Where can I find it?"
"What's on your mind?"
"What's on your mind?"
"He only does what he wants."
"We did what we could."

"It's time to move on."
"What could have happened?"
"What's going to happen?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"How long ago was that?"
"I think this is a great idea."

"She left an hour ago."
"Yes, that's what I thought."
"Yeah, that's what I thought."
"That's all I ask of you."
"That's all I ask of you."
"I have to ask you something."
"I ask you this for the last time."
"I don't do that kind of thing."
"Let me see what I can do."
"I never told anyone about it."
"What happened to him?"
"I don't know what happened."
"What happened to you?"
"I wonder what happened to him."
"What happened to me?"
"You can stay as long as you want."
"What are they going to do to him?"
"You don't belong here."
"You don't belong here."
"There is room for two."
"I knew there was something."
"I could say the same thing about you."
"What did you give him?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Who am I talking to?"
"That's one way of looking at it."
"That's what I wanted to talk to you about."
"That's all we need."
"That's all we need."
"This is what I wanted to talk to you about."
"Is that what it's about?"
"That's all you need."
"I think it's a good idea."
"Can you give me a hand?"
"I'll give you a hand."
"I'll give you a hand."

"Please don't do this."
"What do you think about this?"
"So what do you think?"
"Is that what you think of me?"
"Do you think this is a good idea?"
"You think I don't know?"
"You think I don't know?"
"You don't mean what you say."
"Are you thinking the same thing as me?"
"I know what you think of me."
"I know what you think of me."
"What do you think of me?"
"That's all you need to know."
"It could have happened to anyone."
"You never know what might happen."
"What will happen to me?"
"That's what we're trying to find out."
"What do you say to that?"
"So what do you say?"
"Tell him what you told me."
"We have a lot to talk about."
"What is most important?"
"I know this is important to you."
"That's exactly what I'm going to do."
"That's exactly what I meant."
"That's exactly what he said."
"This is exactly what we need."
"What does that mean exactly?"
"This is exactly what I need."
"That's exactly what we're going to do."
"I see exactly what you mean."
"That's exactly what I was thinking."
"What did you think about it?"
"Good things come to those who wait."
"It's a matter of perspective."
"That's all I remember."
"That's all I remember."
"He was here a minute ago."
"I'll only be a minute."
"Do you know who you remind me of?"
"You have no say in the matter."
"You only have to say the word."
"You only have to say the word."
"What's taking so long?"
"What's taking so long?"
"It's time to go home."
"At least, that's what I thought."
"What's going on there?"
"What are you doing there?"
"What are you doing there?"
"What are you doing there?"
"What is he doing there?"
"Do you think it's easy for me?"
"It's easy for you to say that."

"It was nice to see you."
"It's always a pleasure to see you."
"It was nice to see you again."
"It was nice to see you again."
"It was nice to see you."
"I was told you were here."
"I think we've covered it."
"This is what you always wanted."
"What did he mean?"
"You did all you could."
"It was the least I could do."
"But what are you talking about?"
"So what do you think?"
"What do you think about this?"
"Do you think this is a good idea?"
"What the hell are you doing with that?"
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"What the hell are you doing in my house?"
"What are you doing up there?"
"What are you doing up there?"
"What's going on up there?"
"Maybe there is another way."
"There must be another way."
"That's how it all began."
"That's how it started."
"What's wrong with your face?"
"Listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you."
"What happened?"

"That's all you have to do."
"That's all you have to do."
"I know that's what you want."
"Is this what you want?"
"Do you know what it is?"
"Is that all I am to you?"
"I have told you everything I know."
"I told him not to do it."
"And that's why I'm here."
"Is that all you have to say?"
"Is that all you have to say?"
"That's all I can tell you."
"That's all I can tell you."
"No, that's not what I mean."
"I'll tell you what I'm going to do."
"I'll tell you what I'm going to do."
"Can't or don't want to?"
"It's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's just you and me."
"If it's not you, who is it?"
"Isn't that what you said?"
"No, that's not what I want."
"What can I do for you?"
"What can I do for you?"
"But what is this?"

"What more can I do?"
"What's up with him?"
"What have you done for me?"
"And you know what he said to me?"
"What's over there?"
"What am I going to do with him?"
"So what is this?"
"What is this thing?"
"What's wrong with you?"
"Yes, that's what I was told."
"Do you want to tell me what he did?"
"What do we care?"
"But what was that?"
"I don't know what he did."
"But what can I do about it?"
"That's all they told me."
"What do you care?"
"You know exactly what I mean."

"What do you do for a living?"
"What do you do for a living?"
"What does he do for a living?"
"What am I doing with my life?"
"What did he do this time?"
"I've never seen anything like this in my life."
"I have never seen you in my life."
"What am I going to do without you?"
"That's what everyone tells me."
"Are you sure this is all yours?"
"That's what I want to talk to you about."
"You did what you had to do."
"What do you think I'm doing?"
"You think that's what I want?"
"Is this what I believe?"
"No, it's not what you think."
"What do you think you're doing?"
"What do you think it is?"
"No, I think it's always been you."
"Is that what I think it is?"
"Is that what I think it is?"
"My God, what are we going to do?"
"Is this what I think?"
"What did you just tell me?"
"What did I just tell you?"
"What does he mean by that?"
"There must be something that can be done."
"At home, you can do whatever you want."
"I have heard a lot of good things about you."
"That's a good thing, isn't it?"
"Because it's the right thing to do."
"This is the best."
"I know you did your best."
"What are you going to do with him?"
"And you, what are you going to do?"
"Don't tell me what to do."
"What aren't you telling me?"
"No, that's not what I'm saying."
"If you have something to say, say it."
"If you have something to say, say it."
"Tell me, what is it?"
"And what do you say to that?"
"Let me know if you need anything."
"Don't tell me what I already know."
"That's why I'm telling you."
"What are you doing at home?"
"There is something you need to know."
"There is something you should know."
"You're going to tell me what I want to know."
"There is one thing you need to know."
"What is there to know?"
"Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
"Don't you want to know what it is?"
"That's how I see it."
"There are things we don't do."
"What is this name?"
"It only happens once in a lifetime."
"You know what you have to do."
"You know what you have to do."
"I know what I have to do."
"No, that's not what I meant."
"That's what I wanted to talk to you about."
"That's why I wanted to talk to you."
"That's why I wanted to see you."
"Is that why you wanted to see me?"
"That's all I wanted to tell you."
"Do you think that's what I wanted?"
"What are you doing right now?"
"I don't think this is the time."
"What's going on between you?"
"Would you mind telling me what's going on?"
"Do you want to tell me what's going on?"
"But what's going on here?"

"What's going on in your head?"
"You did all you could."
"Call me if you need anything."
"What are you two doing?"
"Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
"I need to talk to you about something."
"You see, that's what I'm talking about."
"Are you sure this is a good idea?"
"Are you sure this is a good idea?"
"Do you have any idea what this is?"
"I think this is a very good idea."
"I'll tell you what's going to happen."
"This is how it should be."
"What could have happened?"
"What is this thing?"
"How long have you been here?"

"What just happened?"
"How long have you been together?"
"I told you to stay in the car."
"Is there anything I should know?"
"What is this question?"

"I thought that's what you wanted."
"When was the last time you spoke to him?"
"When was the last time you spoke to him?"
"I don't know what happened to him."

"What did he come here for?"
"What did you come here for?"
"What are you doing in my room?"
"It was the best night of my life."
"I have to give you a little bit of myself."
"I'm giving a friend a hand."
"Can someone tell me what's going on?"
"There is someone who wants to see you."
"If anyone can do it, it's you."
"There is someone who wants to talk to you."
"From someone who no longer needed it."
"Will someone tell me what's going on?"
"What is it, darling?"
"Is that how you want to play it?"
"Can I ask you something?"
"This is the best day of my life."
"It was the best day of my life."
"Boss, what did he do to you?"
"Do you really think this is a good idea?"
"There is something you need to know."
"There is something you must see."
"There is one thing you need to know."
"Is that why you called me?"
"That's why I called you."
"What aren't you telling me?"
"Don't tell me what to do."
"If you have something to say, say it."
"Don't you have anything more important to do?"
"And that's exactly what I'm going to do."
"That's exactly what I told him."
"You will do exactly what I tell you."
"You think I didn't think about that?"
"And everyone who had to deal with her."
"But you're going to impress them."
"Don't you see what's at stake?"
"I remember it like it was yesterday."
"That's the last thing I remember."
"What is the last thing you remember?"
"Do you remember what we said?"
"And that's all I remember."
"You think I don't want to?"
"We are men of the Night's Watch."
"Not everyone can say the same."
"I'll be here if you need me."
"I can't think of anything else."
"That's all I can think about."
"What makes you think that?"
"I think I'll go home."
"What are you looking at me for?"
"I don't think we have a choice."
"What's over there?"
"What's going on there?"
"What's down there?"
"It's easier said than done."
"I want to hear what he has to say."
"It is a pleasure doing business with you."
"It's a pleasure doing business with you."
"So, I think I'll keep the rest."
"This is the last time we see each other."
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"Are you sure this is a good idea?"
"I'm sure there's something."
"Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
"I never meant for any of this to happen."
"If you don't do it, I will."
"If you don't, I will."
"I will do everything in my power."
"What are you doing here so early?"
"You will pay for what you did."
"He must pay for what he did."

"We'll show them what we can do."
"What is it, my love?"
"What do you like about music?"
"Can I talk to you for a second?"
"No one had ever been so kind to me."

"Did anyone see what happened?"
"Are you going to tell me what happened?"
"I want to know what happened."
"What happened between you?"
"And what happened?"
"Please don't do this to me."
"You don't know what happened."
"My God, what happened?"
"But what happened here?"
"It's the only way out."
"Can I have your attention, please?"
"That's what I would do in his place."
"But we have to take care of him."
"It was the best thing that could have happened to him."
"Party with the king who's who?"
"You did what you had to do."
"Is there anything I can do?"
"That's why I came here."
"Let's see if we can find you something to eat."
"What happened to your hair?"
"Children, we don't play in the street."
"What are you doing in the dark?"
"I think it happened to him by accident."
"There are millions of dollars at stake."
"You know that dream, it's always the same."
"There is something you should see."
"There is something you should know."
"There is something else you should see."
"She won't have a child behind your back?"
"Can you tell me what it is?"
"So that's what it's all about?"
"And a chance for you to finish your journey."
"Because you don't know why or where you're going.'"
"You are free to do whatever you want."
"That's how we met."
"What do you want me to do?"
"What do you want me to do?"
"Tell me what you want me to do."
"What do you want us to do?"
"What do you want us to do?"
"What did you want me to do?"
"What should I do?"
"Is that what you want me to do?"
"What does he want me to do?"
"No, it's not what you think."
"What do you think I can do for you?"
"We told you everything we knew."
"What's in there?"
"What happened in there?"
"If that's me in there, what am I?"
"Can someone explain to me what is going on?"
"What are you doing around here?"
"What are you doing around here?"
"I think I'll follow you this time."
"What could that possibly mean?"
"It's time to end this mission."
"I don't know what happened to him."
"He knows how to behave, you can trust him."
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"When was the last time you saw her?"
"When was the last time you saw her?"
"I've never seen him in my life."
"I've never seen her in my life."
"I told you, I don't know."
"I told you, I don't know."
"It's on the other side of town."
"I've never seen him like this."
"Is that all it does to you?"
"It's time to go home."
"Is that why you did it?"
"I had never seen him in my life."
"There is love in the air."
"My mother told me that."
"Can I ask you a question?"
"Can I ask you a question?"
"He shot himself in the head."
"You are the best thing that ever happened to me."
"It's the best thing that ever happened to me."
"How long have we known each other?"
"I swear on my mother's life."
"The law of supply and demand."
"Without the Council's agreement, if necessary."
"Do you think I'm sending you to the cops for me?"
"I swear it on my mother's grave."
"What makes you feel this way?"
"It's said at the end of the song."
"What the hell are you doing in my house?"
"There is something different about you."
"Tonight you have to write him a real letter."
"What took you so long?"
"What took you so long?"
"Is that all you have to say?"
"Are you sure this is a good idea?"

"Did you hear what I said?"
"Did you hear what I told you?"
"That's why I like you."
"What are you looking at me for?"
"I told you to stay in the car."
"Isn't there another way?"
"What's on your mind?"
"Do you know what you look like now?"
"I just wanted to tell you that I love you."
"This is the friend I told you about."
"That's why I'm telling you about it."
"I'll call you if there's anything new."
"What's on the other side?"
"What did I tell you already?"
"What do you have in your hand?"
"I told you not to go."
"How are we going to do this?"
"If you have something to say, say it."
"This is the guy I told you about."
"What happened to your face?"
"Did you see what he did to me?"
"What do you have to tell me?"
"This is the girl I told you about."
"Did he say anything to you?"
"Did you do what I told you?"
"Please don't go away."
"What happened to you last night?"
"I saw you talking to a pretty girl."
"I told you not to do that."
"I told you I didn't know."
"You know I love you more than anything."
"I've never known anyone like you."
"It's like I've known you forever."
"I'll tell you anything you want to know."
"I'll tell you everything you want to know."
"You who have the gift, what have you seen?"
"It means being ready to return to society."
"Is that why you left me?"
"What can I say to that?"
"It would be a new beginning, in a new world."
"What is that noise?"
"I can bring everyone back to life."
"The future is so much more interesting than the past."
"I'm only the second son after all."
"The story takes place in a men's restroom."
"Did you tell him what role you played?"

"It's time to go to school."
"What else can I say?"
"I have never seen anything so beautiful."
"I thought we had an agreement."
"Have you told anyone else?"
"You have nothing else to tell me?"
"What are we going to do with her?"
"They'll be here any minute."
"How do you think this one should be played?"
"I have nowhere else to go."
"What else could it be?"
"For that, I have to become someone else."
"I have no one else to talk to."
"It was over a year ago."
"Gold, silver, other girls."
"You must mistake me for someone else."
"And you're lucky to be here."
"I told you to wait in the car."
"What are we going to do with them?"
"She'll be here any minute."
"Even when we're off duty, we keep the same spirit."
"Captain, you told him to open his mouth."
"What is written there?"
"Have you told anyone else about this?"
"There is so much love in this house."

"Where do I know all this from?"
"He seems like a good guy."
"Do you have anything to say in your defense?"
"Anything special to eat that night?"
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"What am I supposed to do now?"
"I wanted to apologize for earlier."
"They are not interested in anything we have."
"Have I ever told you I love you?"
"I turn around, there are lots of cops outside."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please."
"That's why we came here."
"What are you trying to tell me?"
"There is nothing to be proud of."
"I didn't expect that at all."
"What are these stories?"
"That's all I can offer you."
"This is how I make my living."
"Pass me the big stone, the one that looks like you."
"I'm glad you told me."
"Is that all you have to say?"
"The longest summer in living memory."
"Thank you for allowing me to know myself better."
"What if there is no taxi?"
"Courage is the best defense you have left."

"And this one?"
"And this one?"
"Do you live here?"
"Do you live here?"
"He is different."
"Congratulations."
"What does he say?"
"Did you know her?"
"Can you repeat that?"
"It will come."
"They are right."
"Be a man."
"A date?"
"Want to try?"
"Hey, buddy."
"What are you?"
"What are you?"
"What are you?"
"I am a police officer."
"Can I come up?"
"Nothing new."
"On my signal."
"I think so."
"They are waiting for you."
"They are waiting for you."
"She's coming."
"Are you happy?"
"Are you happy?"
"How are they doing?"
"We'll get it."
"How is he?"
"Let it pass."
"We will do it."
"I know, yes."
"I'm going to open it."
"Who can do better?"
"Hold on tight."
"No comments."
"Do you really think so?"
"Do as I do."
"Good morning."
"What is your name?"
"Let me see."
"It will be fine, thank you."
"Do you hear it?"
"Bring him in."
"Which way?"
"Come get me."
"She is charming."
"And your parents?"
"Come see me."
"It can happen."
"Wait for me there."
"I'm having fun."
"Not that one."
"There you go, like that."
"Keep looking."
"Yes, I can."
"It's romantic."
"I understand better."
"Don't talk."
"You are awesome."
"You are awesome."
"I accept it."
"I was wondering."
"Let me try."
"Sorry, mate."
"Stay with us."
"Go back."
"It comes back to me."
"How do you do it?"
"How do you do it?"
"How do I do it?"
"What does she want?"
"Hold on."
"I'll look."
"He's waiting for you."
"Times are changing."
"I have better."
"Thanks, old man."
"I'll help you."
"I am a doctor."
"Do you want to talk?"
"She loves you."
"I have to call."
"Have a drink."
"Have a drink."
"I don't see."
"You are young."
"I know, honey."
"It's a must."
"Drugs?"
"You are amazing."
"But not now."
"I'm keeping it."
"Are you awake?"
"Are you awake?"
"Are you awake?"
"No pressure."
"Boy or girl?"
"It's deep."
"He is intelligent."
"Just one thing."
"I will wait."
"Thank you, my friend."
"What was she like?"
"Or both."
"Hello, my dear."
"Excuse me?"
"He is awake."
"Thank you very much, sir."
"And good luck."
"That's understandable."
"You will have it."
"Come on, children."
"Come on, kids."
"I'll be back soon."
"I didn't want to."
"It's tricky."
"It looks like it."
"Can I talk?"
"It's sexy."
"Come see this."
"Take care of it."
"You're cute."
"Thank you, my dear."
"As you say."
"Say goodbye."
"It makes sense."
"We'll be there."
"Everything was fine."
"What do you think?"
"What do you think?"
"Who would do that?"
"And your mother?"
"Hey, handsome."
"You are beautiful."
"Here's one."
"Tell him."
"Is it legal?"
"Nothing good."
"When are you coming back?"
"Better not."
"You didn't know?"
"They are beautiful."
"Give them to me."
"I love them."
"Let me finish."
"It is written."
"I'm hot."
"It's remarkable."
"What are you drinking?"
"What are you drinking?"
"And does it work?"
"It's tempting."
"You are perfect."
"We checked."
"Probably not."
"He is young."
"What does that mean?"
"They are ready."
"What am I like?"
"Are you finished?"
"Are you finished?"
"Target in sight."
"Do you understand that?"
"Neither did he."
"I envy you."
"Who wants some?"
"We work together."
"Any."
"Do you have it?"
"Oh, good God."
"I can walk."
"Indeed, yes."
"Where was it?"
"The clock is ticking."
"No money."
"Who are you?"
"Who are you?"
"Who are you?"
"Yeah, I think so."
"In what way?"
"It's better."
"I am surprised."
"Go to bed."
"I'll take him."
"Come on, guys."
"I will pay."
"I will protect you."
"Each in turn."
"You can stay."
"Do you see me?"
"Do you see me?"
"More than anything."
"I want a divorce."
"I understand now."
"I don't know."
"I don't know."
"I have this."
"Do you have everything?"
"Yes, just a moment."
"Take a look."
"Let's go get him."
"To do what?"
"Come see Dad."
"Would you do it?"
"You have to."
"Just a second."
"No, let it go."
"You stay there."
"Who are you calling?"
"I can understand."
"Ah, there you are."
"She is nice."
"If you insist."
"I should leave."
"It happens often."
"And that too."
"Do you recognize her?"
"Stay online."
"Do you see them?"
"She is married."
"Do you want to know?"
"I'm looking at you."
"You stay here."
"You are good."
"We are good."
"We are good."
"Would you do that?"
"I'm single."
"What do I say?"
"It's terrifying."
"I will have it."
"Not a single one."
"I'm for it."
"When do we start?"
"And your wife?"
"And your wife?"
"Family?"
"Goodbye, madam."
"Are you stopping me?"
"Pass it to me."
"Go get dressed."
"Where will you go?"
"Treat yourself."
"Did you know?"
"Do you want this?"
"It should work."
"It's all true."
"Please me."
"I left."
"Open the trunk."
"It was bound to happen."
"We'll talk about it again."
"Did he speak?"
"That would be perfect."
"It may be."
"What are we waiting for?"
"They are superb."
"There you are."
"Yes, you can."
"Here's the lowdown."
"Hey guys."
"It's amazing."
"They are them."
"Bring them in."
"I will be careful."
"That would be great."
"That would be great."
"Show me that."
"What was he like?"
"Yeah, so what?"
"In the corner."
"Just a moment."
"Go there."
"It's locked."
"Where am I?"
"Look at me carefully."
"Let him do it."
"I'll show you."
"No, definitely not."
"Let's see."
"Who knows?"
"Sorry I'm late."
"She came back."
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"Are you looking for me?"
"I think so too."
"Not like you."
"We have them."
"We have them."
"You swear?"
"We're going there."
"Why are you asking?"
"And your father?"
"Did you notice?"
"Have you noticed?"
"Do you have any?"
"I want to live."
"Do you want to drive?"
"Put on your seatbelt."
"It touches me."
"I would like that."
"It's lovely."
"But not you."
"What was she like?"
"Thank you, Father."
"Wait for my signal."
"I'll tell you."
"It is harmless."
"Do you want to come up?"
"I waited."
"Where are we?"
"Full speed ahead."
"Does that suit you?"
"Does that suit you?"
"Can I come in?"
"Which one is it?"
"It will be perfect."
"What would you do?"
"What would you do?"
"We're having fun."
"Do you believe me?"
"Both of them."
"So what?"
"Are you ready?"
"Are you ready?"
"It was great."
"We'll see."
"Can you read?"
"And what else?"
"You're cute."
"He was here."
"It's strong."
"What did he want?"
"I am relieved."
"I am relieved."
"Stay with him."
"Not for you."
"We will meet again."
"I'm waiting outside."
"He knew it."
"Do we understand each other?"
"That was it."
"I was hungry."
"I have to try."
"I see clearly."
"You look great."
"She's better."
"I will contact you."
"It's secret."
"We'll take him away."
"Car accident."
"You don't know?"
"Yes, of course."
"I invite you."
"Far from here."
"And like that?"
"How does he do it?"
"Go see him."
"Someone is coming."
"It's planned."
"Over there."
"Welcome home."
"In a few days."
"Are you there?"
"Thank you, my brother."
"Play is over."
"Oh, I understand."
"Come here, you."
"It's fast."
"Raise your hand."
"Can we talk?"
"It's clean."
"Come to my house."
"You are kind."
"You are kind."
"I'm in."
"I would like to know."
"How was it?"
"It's surprising."
"Go change."
"She is resting."
"It's now."
"It looks like it, yes."
"Look over there."
"Whenever you want."
"Whenever you want."
"Do you work here?"
"We talked."
"We are here."
"We are here."
"Wait a second."
"Did you find it?"
"Did you find it?"
"It seems to me."
"And school?"
"They are."
"We have it."
"We're on it."
"And yours?"
"I'm coming to that."
"I like you."
"How do we do it?"
"How do we do it?"
"I congratulate you."
"Let me speak."
"When was it?"
"Well what?"
"You came."
"She is wonderful."
"Why is that?"
"Let them go."
"I slipped."
"I'm thinking about it."
"Let me look."
"Already back?"
"I'm sure."
"I want some."
"I'll be quick."
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Give it back to me."
"I will be brief."
"Not so sure."
"Can we leave?"
"I really appreciate it."
"My bad."
"You are gifted."
"You are gifted."
"You are gifted."
"I had to."
"What's up?"
"Yes, I know."
"Yes, I know."
"Are you leaving already?"
"I appreciate it."
"Can you explain to me?"
"A new beginning."
"He understood."
"Go get them."
"Who cares?"
"Please."
"Good and you?"
"Who are you looking for?"
"In the basement."
"Everything is good."
"In my arms."
"One more minute."
"I have you."
"I will find her."
"Right now?"
"I am flattered."
"It's big."
"Lots of things."
"I can."
"I can."
"It's successful."
"How many of you are there?"
"How many are you?"
"It's finished."
"She is intelligent."
"It will be quick."
"I am American."
"Not for us."
"I'm going to hang up."
"It will be fun."
"Do you want to taste?"
"We're going to win."
"I recognize you."
"Where am I going?"
"Where am I going?"
"Come on, that's enough."
"One by one."
"You don't know?"
"Let's go to bed."
"Tell you what?"
"I hear them."
"Are you together?"
"For years."
"Thank you, General."
"Here are their stories."
"Let him come in."
"What are you taking?"
"What are you taking?"
"All my life."
"There he is."
"It's confirmed."
"On this side."
"I'm waiting here."
"In my pocket."
"I knew him."
"You'll be fine."
"Ask him."
"I'm going out."
"You deserve it."
"I'm serious."
"He wakes up."
"We'll do it again."
"Of course, darling."
"Is that all?"
"I'm training."
"Be yourself."
"He's stuck."
"We love each other."
"To you too."
"I'm finished."
"I was young."
"He is old."
"Am I clear?"
"Are you coming with me?"
"I believed it."
"I've got your back."
"She's cool."
"You will get there."
"We're going."
"Go sit down."
"My little girl."
"How could I?"
"Don't tire yourself out."
"We remember."
"It's busy."
"Let's make a deal."
"This is the captain."
"Fasten your seatbelts."
"It's tomorrow."
"So tell me."
"Is it necessary?"
"Is it necessary?"
"They are getting closer."
"They are great."
"You came back."
"Do you like me?"
"Do you like it?"
"In the closet."
"We're staying here."
"He came in."
"How do you say?"
"It's human."
"Every time."
"On the table."
"Yes, goodbye."
"What are we looking for?"
"He is smart."
"Turn left."
"Turn left."
"I'm cool."
"There are many of them."
"Were you close?"
"He will be there."
"You were there."
"How much do you want?"
"How much do you want?"
"But I do."
"You are great."
"You're great."
"You should try."
"And your husband?"
"You are handsome."
"You are beautiful."
"What does it smell like?"
"When are we leaving?"
"I have everything."
"Right away."
"He came."
"Welcome."
"Let us pass."
"Do you want to go out?"
"Here and there."
"Do you live here?"
"Do you live here?"
"I was here."
"Let him talk."
"She is young."
"And guess what?"
"Who wants to start?"
"I want to come."
"Let's have a toast."
"The police are coming."
"For the money."
"I know, Mom."
"It's touching."
"I will find out."
"You are adorable."
"Where was she?"
"Not like me."
"I understand her."
"He has it."
"Do you know why?"
"It is stable."
"I understand well."
"Don't hesitate."
"Grow up a little."
"Were you looking for me?"
"They will come back."
"No, listen to me."
"What do we have?"
"You can check."
"Come on, big guy."
"So, go ahead."
"Do you believe that?"
"Are you having fun?"
"A girlfriend?"
"I'm getting dressed."
"Are you happy?"
"No, I'm sorry."
"Don't shout."
"I guessed."
"Have you eaten?"
"I have to."
"We are listening to you."
"You've grown up."
"Are you married?"
"Are you married?"
"And who knows?"
"And now what?"
"Ah, there it is."
"Stay behind me."
"It was interesting."
"He's screwed."
"In the street."
"I am a nurse."
"I will pay you."
"Yes, thank you very much."
"Should I wake you up?"
"Close the doors."
"Let's hope not."
"I am a virgin."
"At school."
"He's better."
"It's over."
"Thank you, my dear."
"Who called?"
"You are wonderful."
"You are amazing."
"Empty your pockets."
"I should go home."
"Yeah, go ahead."
"Get out of here."
"I swear."
"Neither."
"She deserves it."
"Like a baby."
"You can go out."
"You can go out."
"Thank you, Your Majesty."
"He deserves it."
"I understand, sir."
"Do you have them?"
"Turn right."
"Turn right."
"Word of honor."
"That would be great."
"More coffee?"
"We succeeded."
"Are you going there?"
"So far."
"He's still breathing."
"Listen to me everyone."
"It's splendid."
"Shall we do it again?"
"I call them."
"For once."
"Do you want to dance?"
"Do you want to dance?"
"No network."
"What does he want?"
"Hold it tight."
"Just that?"
"Hey, guys."
"In a week."
"Not on the phone."
"And the car?"
"In a moment."
"That reassures me."
"I will come back tomorrow."
"Okay, guys."
"Is he serious?"
"All the more reason."
"One more question."
"Don't give up."
"You are young."
"They are delicious."
"He likes you."
"Take a seat."
"Well, well, well."
"You will do it."
"No one can."
"On the roof."
"We'll check."
"Did you like it?"
"Pass me that."
"In the trunk."
"Were you looking for me?"
"I keep quiet."
"As you wish."
"It's arranged."
"It's huge."
"I will win."
"Can I stay?"
"Make your choice."
"Make your choice."
"He's getting closer."
"It was yesterday."
"I'm engaged."
"Good day, sir."
"Turn up the volume."
"What do I see?"
"And so do we."
"Now I know."
"Let's see."
"Here we are."
"It's classic."
"It's blocked."
"It's temporary."
"Among other things."
"He arrived."
"Do you hear it?"
"Do it, you."
"Are you leaving me?"
"How do you feel?"
"I'm going with him."
"Let's get out of here."
"Is that enough for you?"
"You are strong."
"You are strong."
"Have a nice weekend."
"Move out of there."
"I'll call."
"I'll call."
"Nothing extraordinary."
"They know it."
"Come closer."
"A boyfriend?"
"Just the two of us."
"Hold me tight."
"You are smart."
"This is the truth."
"He's outside."
"Go now."
"How would I know?"
"You promised."
"Call me tomorrow."
"I am an actor."
"How are you doing?"
"Let's have a drink."
"Are you busy?"
"Oh, yes, yes."
"It was cool."
"Maybe less."
"Are you?"
"Who are we?"
"Nothing works."
"I can't wait."
"Hello everyone."
"Did you love him?"
"You are free."
"Raise your head."
"Good night, darling."
"Hello to you."
"Raise your arms."
"Raise your arms."
"Don't ask."
"It is loaded."
"What will you do?"
"What will you do?"
"Let's go see this."
"Are you getting there?"
"I was busy."
"I'm awake."
"Look at this place."
"Take a deep breath."
"And my father?"
"I'm going for it."
"Can we come in?"
"I'm waiting for him."
"It's complete."
"I am realistic."
"Don't push."
"She was beautiful."
"Welcome among us."
"And your day?"
"How do you say?"
"Scout's word."
"I would have liked."
"She will."
"Where will you go?"
"Keep me informed."
"Come with me."
"Try to understand."
"Are you thirsty?"
"Are you thirsty?"
"Are you spying on me?"
"I'll call him."
"Here's the deal."
"Just a moment."
"We call each other."
"Have you heard?"
"Stand up straight."
"I will wait for you."
"They were there."
"As you say."
"I have it."
"Cheers."
"What does she say?"
"And the police?"
"Are you hungry?"
"Are you hungry?"
"Rest in peace."
"What will it be?"
"You know everything."
"You know everything."
"I promised."
"Sorry, old man."
"When are you leaving?"
"We will be there."
"Can you walk?"
"I'm coming from there."
"It's nobody."
"Keep moving forward."
"Now you know."
"Maybe two."
"Where was it?"
"Let's walk a little."
"Thanks be to God."
"I will ask him."
"Hi, sweetie."
"Hello, sweetie."
"Not another word."
"I know, Dad."
"In his office."
"A little everywhere."
"Where is he going?"
"An old friend."
"Show me that."
"Very good question."
"Take care of it."
"How am I doing?"
"I'm keeping it."
"Keep looking."
"Keep looking."
"Hold this for me."
"Yes, actually."
"I'm watching you."
"Are you up for it?"
"You don't want to?"
"Do you want to play?"
"I am rich."
"Get in there."
"Does that surprise you?"
"Does that surprise you?"
"You do it."
"Sure and certain."
"What's wrong with her?"
"You know well."
"Where were you?"
"I survived."
"They are waiting for us."
"It will get better."
"What were you saying?"
"Do you hear yourself?"
"Where and when?"
"Would you like to come inside?"
"Yes, but why?"
"Okay, man."
"No, actually."
"Not for a second."
"Take a look."
"Take a look."
"It's dark."
"It's dark."
"I would like to."
"Go to bed."
"I came back."
"You're awesome."
"We won."
"Let's go talk to him."
"I went out."
"That was before."
"How is mom?"
"You are different."
"Every night."
"And your family?"
"Can you help me?"
"We will find her."
"We will find her."
"Are you a cop?"
"You had to say it."
"You better."
"I knew her."
"You have to eat."
"With what money?"
"She is great."
"Go this way."
"You can stay."
"We will call you."
"Need anything?"
"A good man."
"Can we start?"
"Can I come by?"
"Let yourself go."
"He likes it."
"Open the trunk."
"She is innocent."
"She is lovely."
"I'm in love."
"Where do you live?"
"Where do you live?"
"Do you hear them?"
"How do you know?"
"How do you know?"
"He is everywhere."
"And him too."
"Do it now."
"It will be nice."
"Facing the wall."
"We stay together."
"It's genetic."
"He is wonderful."
"Not for that."
"She is sexy."
"They are beautiful."
"Not once."
"Let's go this way."
"What are you reading?"
"Who is 'they'?"
"Let's go see him."
"It has begun."
"It's midnight."
"I am honored."
"So do it."
"Keep calm."
"He moves."
"One more."
"But what about?"
"Take a chair."
"Thank you, my dear."
"At the airport."
"Let's go together."
"Yes my love."
"I am me."
"He is tall."
"Can you come?"
"I see everything."
"I'm going back to work."
"You have to come."
"When do I start?"
"She's waiting for you."
"She is waiting for you."
"Take one."
"Make a wish."
"It was open."
"He loves it."
"Yes, right there."
"No, that's enough."
"Take the money."
"It was dark."
"It was dark."
"They are waiting for me."
"She's stuck."
"Thank you, my darling."
"Go ahead, try it."
"He'll get over it."
"You are here."
"It's Saturday."
"Come and get it."
"A few more minutes."
"To do what?"
"Well, goodbye."
"In the living room."
"Hello, guys."
"I had to."
"We have to move."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Do your job."
"Do your job."
"Next time."
"Eat something."
"Room service."
"I guess so."
"What did she want?"
"Take mine."
"Where is what?"
"What is it?"
"He is resting."
"It's comforting."
"And you, sir?"
"I'm leaving."
"Hello, Father."
"She has changed."
"Look at this one."
"Sooner or later."
"It's clear."
"Do you feel it?"
"He is a doctor."
"Every man for himself."
"I'm finding out."
"Yeah, very good."
"Do you want to bet?"
"Do you think so?"
"Make an effort."
"Look over there."
"What did you want?"
"Don't you get it?"
"What are we eating?"
"How do you find it?"
"But I understand."
"Truth or Dare?"
"Do the math."
"In a safe place."
"He came back."
"In my bag."
"Repeat after me."
"Repeat after me."
"She's going to love it."
"Okay, that's enough."
"What was he doing?"
"I guessed."
"I believe so too."
"Word for word."
"Do you have any?"
"I will tell them."
"Who are you calling?"
"Who are you calling?"
"Speak for yourself."
"Any one."
"Who is 'we'?"
"In which direction?"
"I am terrified."
"It was excellent."
"We let it go."
"No more secrets."
"Yes, we can."
"How is it?"
"My best friend."
"Does that bother you?"
"Does that bother you?"
"Hello, my dear."
"I am good."
"Good evening, my dear."
"Bring him here."
"I had it."
"You're amazing."
"Just like us."
"It's known."
"You can come in."
"Do you want them?"
"How much is that?"
"Who's in charge here?"
"By doing what?"
"Do you know?"
"Do you know?"
"Welcome to my home."
"I'll show you."
"Thanks for the tip."
"And his mother?"
"No rush."
"I will find you."
"I will find you."
"You look like him."
"We are fine."
"We'll get them."
"Is this correct?"
"Let yourself go."
"But me too."
"Are you interested?"
"Are you interested?"
"It was impressive."
"He confessed."
"I'm clean."
"A little girl."
"It's huge."
"It's over."
"It has changed."
"And my mother?"
"That's enough now."
"He is absent."
"In the back."
"I would like that."
"How was I?"
"You're great."
"Get some rest."
"He is hungry."
"It was there."
"No discussion."
"Try to sleep."
"Try to sleep."
"I have to stay."
"What is he?"
"It will be great."
"We take it."
"We take it."
"Oh, but yes."
"I am you."
"I admit it."
"Hi, friend."
"Go see her."
"Are we going to eat?"
"You learn quickly."
"I'm going to clean."
"So what about this?"
"They entered."
"Keep moving forward."
"Oh, there it is."
"Tomorrow, maybe."
"Maybe tomorrow."
"Can I go out?"
"I congratulate you."
"Were you there?"
"Were you there?"
"She was pregnant."
"Welcome to our home."
"He is right."
"Hello, girls."
"That's smart."
"You'll love it."
"It was magical."
"What a pleasant surprise."
"Obviously."
"Remember that."
"Okay, go ahead."
"Thank you, but no."
"Everything is calm."
"Let him talk."
"Come on, say it."
"Very, very good."
"How much do you have?"
"Go back to bed."
"Think about it."
"Keep calm."
"That would be wonderful."
"Are you talking to me?"
"Are you talking to me?"
"Not without you."
"To protect you."
"And you are?"
"You are fantastic."
"Hold on tight."
"It's recent."
"Don't start."
"Keep your eyes open."
"Open your eyes."
"It was over."
"Countdown."
"Come on, girls."
"Does this amuse you?"
"Not with you."
"How is dad?"
"I want more."
"I'm going to come."
"Everything is clear."
"I looked."
"Look at that."
"Watch your head."
"I imagine so."
"Can we go home?"
"Give your hand."
"I know, honey."
"It was planned."
"He is excellent."
"Because what?"
"Come here, you."
"You are good."
"You're good."
"Can I play?"
"You are perfect."
"A good guy."
"See you soon."
"And after that?"
"Let us do it."
"Very good choice."
"We'll work it out."
"It belongs to me."
"I'm a fan."
"But who knows?"
"They follow us."
"Do you want to drink?"
"I can come back."
"That would be nice."
"In the woods."
"Put it there."
"If you insist."
"It's French."
"What are they?"
"What are you talking about?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Stay behind me."
"The weather is nice."
"We are the same."
"I'll be quick."
"They are cute."
"Do you know how to drive?"
"I would know."
"Goodbye, doctor."
"Let's go then."
"Tell the truth."
"Do you believe it?"
"Look over here."
"Do you want to eat?"
"Is that yes?"
"She is new."
"It's honest."
"Password?"
"Yes, we know."
"Are you awake?"
"That makes sense."
"I mean."
"Take my hand."
"I can't hear."
"Or something else."
"Not at all."
"She is different."
"Are you serious?"
"Are you serious?"
"What am I?"
"Who was there?"
"Come back later."
"Yeah, indeed."
"In the hallway."
"Goodbye, gentlemen."
"Ice."
"You belong to me."
"But why me?"
"Give them to me."
"The baby is coming."
"What do you think?"
"What do you believe?"
"What do you think?"
"Upstairs."
"When are we leaving?"
"Yeah, I think so."
"It was obvious."
"Double or nothing."
"Are you ready?"
"Are you ready?"
"Are you ready?"
"That was all."
"I could have."
"In five minutes."
"Let me introduce myself."
"It will be good."
"Are you serious?"
"He is clean."
"I am a lawyer."
"Hi, boys."
"I came."
"Okay, goodbye."
"Gunshot."
"Yes, my dear."
"I'm outside."
"Are you happy?"
"He is happy."
"Are you putting me back together?"
"Nothing changes."
"Good, General."
"This is getting interesting."
"I promise you."
"Do as I do."
"Change of plans."
"Don't go out."
"Don't go out."
"How did you know?"
"Is he there?"
"I receive you."
"Don't argue."
"We love each other."
"Yeah, I understand."
"Man or woman?"
"Here we go again."
"Do you recognize her?"
"Music."
"Day and night."
"Come on."
"Our deepest condolences."
"And mine?"
"And the woman?"
"In the office."
"I want them."
"You've come to the right place."
"He is fast."
"I am surprised."
"He is in love."
"She's outside."
"You have changed."
"Go back."
"He started."
"I believe her."
"We have to go home."
"You'll see."
"Wait for me outside."
"Just one glass."
"Nothing is going right."
"Not at first."
"No comments."
"Ah, there you are."
"They are adorable."
"It is mandatory."
"Come see mom."
"I learned."
"Stay in position."
"Do you promise?"
"He had better."
"Go get her."
"And his wife?"
"I get up."
"In the bag."
"I'll start."
"I'm leaving now."
"She died."
"Not by me."
"It might be useful."
"She is awake."
"It looks good."
"Where is she going?"
"You are smart."
"You are smart."
"They are fine."
"It's old."
"You can go."
"He loves you."
"You must."
"Yes, my father."
"She's there."
"Can I drive?"
"That's going to change."
"It disgusts me."
"What will you do?"
"It was lovely."
"Go around."
"I'll be outside."
"Like his father."
"She is huge."
"It was superb."
"I tripped."
"It was necessary."
"I am different."
"Bring him to me."
"How many men?"
"I entered."
"Are you a journalist?"
"A little boy."
"Call the cops."
"We're leaving tomorrow."
"How does it work?"
"In two days."
"Not for him."
"Happy for you."
"That's reasonable."
"We will wait."
"They are good."
"They are good."
"Seventeen years old."
"Who is for?"
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"People are talking."
"I can't."
"Beer."
"Do you want to stay?"
"They came back."
"He called."
"I would be there."
"Yes, it's fine."
"He moved."
"For both of you."
"Take off your pants."
"Oh yeah, really?"
"He was kind."
"Here you are at last."
"I loved him."
"You are pregnant."
"Very well, madam."
"We're going to talk."
"That was nice."
"It was nice."
"No, not there."
"He looks like you."
"Do you miss him?"
"Say it again."
"Get them out."
"Go ahead, talk."
"Were you waiting for me?"
"I'll be fine."
"Face to face."
"Shall we have lunch together?"
"They left."
"You can talk."
"It will be easy."
"Don't listen to him."
"Show it to me."
"They know everything."
"I'm going to go in."
"Don't come."
"It is closed."
"He is great."
"And yours?"
"He died."
"Be ready."
"Take a tour."
"We know each other."
"And your brother?"
"Stay with her."
"What will you take?"
"And that's it?"
"What do you feel?"
"Do you want to leave?"
"Hey, buddy."
"Are you pregnant?"
"Not at my place."
"Now listen to me."
"Who spoke?"
"He won."
"The clock is ticking."
"Soon, I hope."
"Who started it?"
"Are you in a hurry?"
"I feel it."
"What did you think?"
"I hear well."
"And so does she."
"As much as possible."
"No photos."
"What was it?"
"And the family?"
"When is he coming back?"
"When is he coming back?"
"I will be good."
"They have it."
"Since this morning."
"Hi, you two."
"My ex-wife."
"It was beautiful."
"Hello, friends."
"Keep walking."
"Take off your clothes."
"Don't get me wrong."
"Don't get me wrong."
"Get in line."
"And do what?"
"Yes, my lord."
"She succeeded."
"We were friends."
"We were friends."
"Stay back."
"It's better."
"Come to me."
"A little drink?"
"Yes, that too."
"Would you do it?"
"She is splendid."
"Get in there."
"If you allow me."
"I am divorced."
"She loves it."
"We are brothers."
"Count on it."
"My old friend."
"Wait for me there."
"You're home."
"Come on, get to work."
"I'm changing."
"As you wish."
"Your turn."
"We're a team."
"Stay with him."
"Nothing new."
"It's common."
"Thank you, friend."
"Welcome everyone."
"Be careful."
"Are you waiting for me?"
"Hello, my love."
"We will get there."
"Let them pass."
"You did great."
"No name."
"Here and now."
"Wait, guys."
"It excites me."
"Go have fun."
"It's green."
"I am a psychiatrist."
"Can you move?"
"Did you know that?"
"Hi, handsome."
"Can I finish?"
"He passed."
"Look at this guy."
"I recognize you."
"The door slams."
"Have a drink."
"And then what?"
"Here for you."
"Make a wish."
"It's Thursday."
"I can handle it."
"I'm replacing him."
"What did he say?"
"Hello, young man."
"I respect you."
"Do you excuse us?"
"You are kind."
"Shall we have dinner together?"
"Get him out."
"Come on, guys."
"Did you like it?"
"Did you like it?"
"Including me."
"Can you hear me?"
"I have decided."
"Let us go."
"Go there."
"Please follow us."
"How is she?"
"Go wash yourself."
"There are two of them."
"It will be necessary."
"Let them go."
"It's noon."
"I will speak."
"Is he here?"
"She is fantastic."
"She's coming."
"Not my type."
"It will be."
"She will be."
"Do you want it?"
"You tried."
"In two weeks."
"Oh, look at this."
"I greet you."
"They have arrived."
"You can."
"You can."
"Are you taking me?"
"I'm working on it."
"Sorry about that."
"Who was she?"
"What do we know?"
"We must eat."
"I paid."
"Did you find it?"
"I walk past."
"Bring him in."
"And not you?"
"Stay a little longer."
"I am human."
"I think I know."
"Who is responsible?"
"Keep moving forward."
"Tell me everything."
"Stay like that."
"He tried."
"I asked."
"There were two of them."
"They are nice."
"Shall we kiss?"
"Are you a lawyer?"
"Of course, darling."
"In two hours."
"And the girls?"
"Who was he?"
"I will write to you."
"Another day."
"I grew up."
"She knows everything."
"I would have tried."
"It's fair."
"Do you believe her?"
"Are you high?"
"He's going to love it."
"How many were there?"
"Take off your shoes."
"Yes, on the contrary."
"He deserved it."
"It was real."
"You have to choose."
"To protect me."
"And two."
"Let's have a drink."
"He knows me."
"Stay online."
"Take a picture."
"Can I touch?"
"It's small."
"Please stand up."
"Each to their own."
"And why is that?"
"How can you?"
"Any last words?"
"Are you not sleeping?"
"It's dark."
"What were you doing?"
"It was right."
"She was sick."
"Look over there."
"What are you becoming?"
"But it will be fine."
"What do you suggest?"
"And women?"
"Let's go get her."
"Don't be shy."
"Will you do it?"
"I will pay you."
"Always the same."
"You are welcome."
"What do you prefer?"
"What do you prefer?"
"In due time."
"It's going to happen."
"She is unconscious."
"I learn quickly."
"For you too."
"You didn't know that?"
"He is rich."
"And your parents?"
"And the child?"
"It will be fine."
"Do you remember me?"
"We concentrate."
"Go with him."
"Let's get out of here."
"It was late."
"When are you leaving?"
"How's it going?"
"Do you feel it?"
"It was cute."
"Don't think."
"Who says it?"
"Yes, one second."
"But not too much."
"Go ahead, keep going."
"In theory, yes."
"Not so good."
"It works well."
"I loved it."
"Use it."
"No children."
"I'll make it work."
"This is unforgivable."
"I want to play."
"Here's the money."
"There, you see?"
"You are different."
"I'll make it up to you."
"In the garden."
"We'll talk about it."
"Don't stay there."
"One more."
"You would be surprised."
"You would be surprised."
"I'm new."
"Yes, whatever."
"He is behind."
"It was extraordinary."
"You can begin."
"He ran away."
"Wherever you want."
"You can't."
"What is she?"
"This explains that."
"For eternity."
"And you, then?"
"I don't find it."
"Nothing at all."
"That doesn't work either."
"Good luck, Jim."
"You have to believe."
"You're cute."
"You are cute."
"Look ahead."
"Look ahead."
"Come get me."
"I know how to read."
"And your family?"
"Are you married?"
"The other side."
"Yes, my lieutenant."
"The cops are coming."
"Do you have it?"
"It will be great."
"You see clearly."
"What are you drinking?"
"Get rid of it."
"I know, thank you."
"Does this speak to you?"
"Does this speak to you?"
"Good, Colonel."
"Are you dating?"
"Go ahead then."
"You love it."
"Do you miss her?"
"Did you know?"
"He is free."
"No noise."
"I'm hiding."
"I will join you."
"I am honest."
"Someone is approaching."
"He is hiding."
"We've got you."
"Where is Tony?"
"He was good."
"I respect him."
"On the side."
"Not this one."
"Like your father."
"Why come here?"
"Let's go now."
"You are lucky."
"Just a moment."
"He is charming."
"I want to try."
"Like my father."
"Are you there?"
"Hey, look at this."
"It's mind-blowing."
"A little advice."
"They are looking for you."
"Not to you."
"Stay the course."
"Not the least."
"I want to dance."
"Explain that to me."
"Explain that to me."
"I'm in it."
"I am Jewish."
"She is happy."
"Is that you?"
"No, listen to me."
"He is a lawyer."
"And my son?"
"Are you a doctor?"
"My grandfather."
"Not from me."
"What do I have?"
"Let's go to my house."
"You are pretty."
"Yeah, I see."
"Do what is necessary."
"Do your thing."
"Yes, we can."
"She loves you."
"Take mine."
"I will teach you."
"No, stay here."
"I am a vegetarian."
"And what about us?"
"Now I understand."
"Are you on drugs?"
"And something else."
"And guess what?"
"Listen to me carefully."
"This is the situation."
"We will find them."
"It was dark."
"I know that."
"Food."
"Thank you, you too."
"I can change."
"I'm going to change."
"Who are you calling?"
"Just this once."
"And here it is."
"For what reasons?"
"They are outside."
"I felt it."
"I want this."
"No fingerprints."
"What was I like?"
"I have class."
"How many fingers?"
"Are you hiding?"
"Here is the address."
"Spread your legs."
"He's done for."
"Let me drive."
"She is old."
"You are here."
"Do you want to watch?"
"Come on, do it."
"I am a teacher."
"You must understand."
"You have to understand."
"Who lives here?"
"I was terrified."
"Same for you."
"In the middle of the night?"
"You should go home."
"How did you know?"
"And you two?"
"Here, take this."
"Dad came home."
"Who, me?"
"What are you reading?"
"What are they like?"
"Who is following me?"
"How do I do it?"
"Don't smile."
"At your service."
"It was mean."
"Get her out."
"That will be all."
"Thank you, sweetie."
"I'll be home late."
"You have an interest."
"It's admirable."
"Did you notice?"
"She is special."
"And his father?"
"Keep your distance."
"Keep your distance."
"Where will we go?"
"It's comfortable."
"You are sexy."
"God keep you."
"To serve you."
"Wait and see."
"I want to understand."
"It's sweet."
"Yeah, you too."
"This weekend?"
"It is delicious."
"Have you had dinner?"
"And the father?"
"Well, thank you."
"That makes two."
"I was thirsty."
"Reinforcements are arriving."
"And his family?"
"Are you?"
"In the house."
"At this time?"
"I am an adult."
"I admire you."
"I admire you."
"Of course, Dad."
"I say it."
"It's cooked."
"Hello, my son."
"I had to."
"Do you know him?"
"This is Ben."
"You're back."
"You came back."
"A little better."
"Go talk to him."
"I want to talk."
"No signal."
"Eighteen years old."
"Wait for my signal."
"Everything is said."
"How do you say?"
"How do you say?"
"Go ahead, man."
"There are three of them."
"We are being watched."
"It's going to get hot."
"No alcohol."
"Yes, that one."
"I'm looking for him."
"Come on, to bed."
"That would be nice."
"I am a volunteer."
"Welcome home."
"Please forgive me."
"You come home late."
"It's new."
"He's in it."
"No question."
"At what price?"
"Who is asking for it?"
"We've got her."
"Let's talk about you."
"No phone."
"I'll be there soon."
"Take off your jacket."
"Here, take it."
"And the job?"
"Yeah, good idea."
"Neither does she."
"A great man."
"I'm teasing you."
"I'm going to work."
"She is stable."
"I'll fix that."
"We are hungry."
"Completely agree."
"Welcome to America."
"Watch out for the steps."
"I chose."
"Good day, gentlemen."
"Where was he?"
"Were you waiting for me?"
"I knocked."
"It is necessary."
"How many people?"
"It happens sometimes."
"Get plenty of rest."
"He loved you."
"Go ahead, darling."
"He's fair."
"He is small."
"Wait a moment."
"Go ahead, tell us."
"This is essential."
"But you, yes."
"Okay, wait."
"About a year."
"You are sublime."
"What color?"
"We love you."
"How can I thank you?"
"Yes, you can."
"Yes, you can."
"Take a little aim."
"No family."
"I'm terrified."
"What are you?"
"Let him wait."
"You're awesome."
"Are you sincere?"
"Take the car."
"It's burning hot."
"She's burning hot."
"Would you like to?"
"It's Halloween."
"What were you saying?"
"What were you saying?"
"My God, yes."
"Easy as pie."
"Good night, madam."
"Yes, and you?"
"Did you call?"
"Did you call?"
"I'm getting off here."
"We have to get out of here."
"Thank you, Colonel."
"Everything will change."
"Everything is closed."
"I am Catholic."
"Do you know this?"
"You know that?"
"Do you know this?"
"I understand them."
"You or me?"
"I'm awake."
"He loves her."
"She is hot."
"Trust you?"
"So do this."
"Show it to me."
"Show it to me."
"Take it easy."
"I'm excited."
"I'm excited."
"Are you up for it?"
"I counted."
"Come back and see us."
"It's great."
"You are wonderful."
"The whole truth."
"I searched."
"I'll ask."
"Is it seen?"
"Will you call me?"
"Look at this one."
"What, what, what?"
"I'm getting ready."
"You look like him."
"It is correct."
"What do you choose?"
"Keep looking."
"Thank you, I appreciate it."
"She is shy."
"This is the story."
"Nice day, huh?"
"Did you know her?"
"Just a few minutes."
"And my brother?"
"We will contact you."
"It brings luck."
"Very well, gentlemen."
"Do you promise me?"
"Alcohol."
"This is the result."
"We are partners."
"We are partners."
"All right, listen."
"She belongs to me."
"Are you busy?"
"Are you busy?"
"Ah, very good."
"Do you like them?"
"Do you like them?"
"I will be here."
"We're going to talk."
"Good morning my love."
"Hello my love."
"It's Thanksgiving."
"He loved me."
"Well, good night."
"Let them do it."
"How much does it cost?"
"Go back to bed."
"You are beautiful."
"Go on without me."
"What did they want?"
"Take a look."
"Take a look."
"What am I looking for?"
"It is heavy."
"Next month."
"We have some."
"I don't know."
"Ask him."
"It's deserved."
"You don't know?"
"You are being unfair."
"Where is Ben?"
"Exit the vehicle."
"And your son?"
"I have arrived."
"She will be there."
"I was thinking about it."
"Nothing interesting."
"She was kind."
"You're toast."
"Do you recognize them?"
"They came."
"When are you coming back?"
"It's Saturday."
"No news."
"It was hot."
"You too."
"Now listen to me."
"Let's go there."
"Let's turn around."
"A long story."
"Take a walk."
"And look at this."
"These two."
"What to do now?"
"For a while."
"At the same time?"
"Go get them."
"I would have preferred."
"Slow down a little."
"We must move forward."
"It cut out."
"Where was I?"
"Let me explain."
"Think about what?"
"It's late."
"We are friends."
"This is encouraging."
"They are."
"Hello, my pretty."
"It's quiet."
"You're doing well."
"Here's my number."
"He was fine."
"Do you speak English?"
"Here is my card."
"Don't try."
"What are you eating?"
"When are you coming back?"
"It's positive."
"She was here."
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"Hi, Mom."
"I will pay you back."
"How much is it worth?"
"I will protect you."
"He left."
"I gave up."
"Does that surprise you?"
"We are close."
"No witnesses."
"Do you recognize that?"
"She is excellent."
"But why not?"
"I freaked out."
"It's won."
"You will have them."
"You will have them."
"He goes there."
"He adores you."
"Last year."
"With your permission."
"We found it."
"We'll talk about it again."
"Am I?"
"Do you really want to?"
"She was good."
"Do you understand now?"
"It's Friday."
"But you do."
"The world is changing."
"Go ahead, come in."
"Not a single one."
"You are asked."
"You should have."
"You should have."
"Make yourself useful."
"Come on, my darling."
"It does."
"He was there."
"Good night, gentlemen."
"On the couch."
"You will be."
"She understood."
"Yes, but how?"
"What do you see?"
"It's canceled."
"We're going to dance."
"All the same."
"With all due respect."
"It's great."
"For children."
"I understand why."
"How much do you want?"
"How much do you want?"
"How much do you want?"
"I remind him."
"It will be me."
"Take care of it."
"Take care of it."
"He's hot."
"For life."
"Bring it up."
"You're gone."
"Do it like this."
"My boyfriend."
"You can go home."
"You can go home."
"Where do you work?"
"He stays here."
"Only two more."
"We'll come back to that."
"Well, yes."
"Turn the page."
"Check this out."
"I'm just saying."
"Thanks, I'll be fine."
"I can imagine."
"It will be fine."
"Easy, guys."
"He's fine."
"She came back."
"Reach out."
"She's waiting for me."
"Hello at your place."
"Well, I hope so."
"You are smart."
"Who are they?"
"It's Tuesday."
"We are engaged."
"We're engaged."
"Thank you, girls."
"Keep talking."
"Or someone."
"Come get her."
"Come aboard."
"Well done, man."
"My girlfriend."
"Give it to him."
"Give this to him."
"Watch your language."
"Do your job."
"You're going to be great."
"Play the game."
"So, good luck."
"You promised."
"You promised."
"Well, yes."
"He is sexy."
"You are brave."
"Come kiss me."
"Here are the keys."
"He grew up."
"Look at me carefully."
"Yes, it works."
"Take the money."
"She likes it."
"This is Tony."
"How does he do it?"
"That's brave."
"No one answers."
"But what to do?"
"He is pretty."
"Did you speak?"
"It's full."
"More than one."
"It's Friday."
"Hold it tight."
"Be more specific."
"Be more specific."
"Yes, it seems."
"Are you going to answer?"
"How else to do it?"
"Are you friends?"
"In a few minutes."
"This is Ted."
"We will be there."
"They will."
"Good, my captain."
"I'll take you back."
"Have you had lunch?"
"Can you drive?"
"I will be ready."
"A little smile."
"There's someone."
"But it will come."
"I'm still waiting."
"I don't drink."
"Lock the door."
"Bring them in."
"Take your coat."
"I appreciate that."
"Date of birth?"
"Kirk to Enterprise."
"Look who's here."
"Me, for example."
"I protect you."
"Will you do it?"
"It's divine."
"Pay close attention."
"I know how."
"But not him."
"How much do you have?"
"This is Nick."
"Bring her in."
"Where are they?"
"Where are they?"
"We are different."
"I'm going to play."
"At this point?"
"On the road."
"I'll show you."
"Watch and learn."
"My little boy."
"Are you happy?"
"Are you happy?"
"Another question."
"Can you hear us?"
"In your room."
"They are superb."
"At first, yes."
"They were right."
"I'm new."
"They love it."
"She loved me."
"Everything is planned."
"Go back there."
"Tell him, you."
"Go this way."
"Are we ready?"
"What are they doing?"
"Do you have everything?"
"And another one."
"Are you American?"
"Here is the plan."
"Don't you think so?"
"What kind?"
"About an hour."
"I'll wait here."
"This is Billy."
"She is cold."
"She's cool."
"Is it essential?"
"It's starting well."
"Just a few questions."
"Don't ask me."
"In the truck."
"They will come."
"Taste this."
"I am fast."
"She was beautiful."
"Come on, guys."
"Just a few days."
"We talked."
"It still works."
"I hoped so."
"I'm watching you."
"She loves him."
"You, for example."
"In the water."
"Is it him?"
"Can you swim?"
"Not on me."
"Here is the address."
"He loves it."
"You are a doctor."
"In this case."
"Go ahead, you."
"As soon as possible."
"And your work?"
"I'll look for it."
"Keep walking."
"Keep walking."
"Hello, my darling."
"What you say."
"But me, yes."
"And my wife?"
"Are we going to have lunch?"
"Breakfast."
"Go see him."
"They are innocent."
"Think about it."
"Of course, madam."
"Are you in a hurry?"
"Are you in a hurry?"
"How many were there?"
"Consider yourself lucky."
"It will never work."
"In my head."
"So do it."
"He is special."
"She arrived."
"You want this?"
"Have you eaten?"
"Have you eaten?"
"Drop it."
"What are you hiding?"
"Get out of here."
"What are we celebrating?"
"No locker."
"What do they want?"
"No papers."
"We knew it."
"Not this one."
"Trust him."
"It's huge."
"Very well, yes."
"Are you satisfied?"
"Two, three, four."
"Say my name."
"Can I speak?"
"I'll catch up with you."
"For your own good."
"Do you understand me?"
"He is black."
"I'm going down."
"No, General."
"One of the best."
"Let her talk."
"Do it now."
"He survived."
"No, this way."
"It was important."
"Take my place."
"Who will know?"
"Yes, my son."
"I am an actress."
"They are different."
"Why this look?"
"Take care."
"Let him do it."
"Yes, once."
"Who were they?"
"Business is picking up."
"I'll be back tomorrow."
"Hey, calm down."
"I prefer to walk."
"Go ahead now."
"It looks like him."
"Listen, guys."
"Towards the north."
"Very good, indeed."
"They went out."
"He is fantastic."
"This is promising."
"You must stay."
"Go look elsewhere."
"I'm going to jump."
"You should stay."
"A small room?"
"Much better, thank you."
"That'll teach you."
"Empty your pockets."
"We have everything."
"It worked."
"This is my wife."
"Look over here."
"He is waiting for us."
"Where am I going?"
"Stay back."
"Open the window."
"Can I taste?"
"You came."
"Put on your shoes."
"Who is?"
"Do you want to taste?"
"I liked it."
"Now go ahead."
"Do you want to start again?"
"She loved you."
"Okay, come on."
"It will be necessary."
"Not very far."
"Lucky break."
"The show begins."
"What about my money?"
"As you wish."
"As you wish."
"Who is there?"
"It's daytime."
"We are listening to you."
"This is Bob."
"Do we have to?"
"Can you see?"
"Are you inviting me?"
"Can you repeat that?"
"Hello, my love."
"Hello, my love."
"Better than you."
"But I will come back."
"Red or white?"
"You're finished."
"Straight to the point."
"She looks like you."
"Look at his eyes."
"I speak English."
"She is in love."
"Are you interested?"
"Can you imagine?"
"I'm leaving you."
"Take a taxi."
"Here is my number."
"They are young."
"Are you cops?"
"But who is this?"
"They are pretty."
"There are some left."
"I don't play."
"In a moment."
"She knew it."
"He has to go."
"Many times."
"Take a chair."
"Have you had dinner?"
"What do we know?"
"On what basis?"
"I want it all."
"You will win."
"It was personal."
"Get her out."
"And then what?"
"You are strong."
"Nothing like that."
"Under the bed."
"Really very good."
"One less."
"Do you want them?"
"Are you leaving us?"
"Are you close?"
"What was I saying?"
"They are great."
"They are awesome."
"I can pay."
"In a few hours."
"I'm having a blast."
"I will come back soon."
"This will be brief."
"Come on, my dear."
"I receive you."
"It was huge."
"I will find him again."
"Are you new?"
"And you yourself?"
"I like him."
"I'm going up."
"Are you married?"
"Where does he live?"
"No message."
"I am a dancer."
"What are you selling?"
"Yes, you know."
"You did great."
"What are you taking?"
"What was she like?"
"Can we come in?"
"Do you want to continue?"
"I was terrified."
"Do you want to live?"
"In my car."
"I miss them."
"Don't delay."
"Don't delay."
"Come to me."
"Do you want to check?"
"Further left."
"What do you mean, 'we'?"
"It's tight."
"An old friend."
"Yes, you should."
"I want to participate."
"And his parents?"
"Tell them what?"
"We were having fun."
"Not so simple."
"This is the key."
"Excuse me?"
"Thanks to me."
"Don't move forward."
"Put it there."
"Put it there."
"Put it there."
"Put it there."
"It's Wednesday."
"You are charming."
"And mine."
"Promise me."
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"Let's go for a walk."
"Grass?"
"There were three of them."
"Get some fresh air."
"At my mother's."
"I will stay here."
"Hello, my friend."
"Do yourself a favor."
"End of transmission."
"You are beautiful."
"Let's try something else."
"Will you be there?"
"Will you be there?"
"I want to."
"Ready to go?"
"Let me see this."
"Last month."
"Who are you looking for?"
"I have to check."
"Do you love me?"
"That would be cool."
"A door slams."
"Well, goodbye."
"Have you booked?"
"What are we?"
"Here you are at last."
"I'm watching him."
"Thank you, my little one."
"Ah, there it is."
"Where are you?"
"I'm going to eat."
"He wants it."
"It's fixed."
"Trust us."
"Goodbye, thank you."
"Of course, why?"
"I take everything."
"Who will pay?"
"In the garage."
"Yes, one minute."
"I slept."
"Shh, shh, shh."
"Surname?"
"Can we begin?"
"I know myself."
"Let him in."
"Let him in."
"I feel them."
"They are awesome."
"Is she there?"
"Count on us."
"Count on us."
"It's big."
"And how are you?"
"How are you?"
"Do you like them?"
"Do you like them?"
"Are you taking me?"
"It's said."
"Magic."
"You have to choose."
"Firing."
"Nobody is looking."
"It seems logical."
"Who's interested?"
"I'll start again."
"End of message."
"And yours?"
"They call us."
"Here is one."
"I'm going to cum."
"We'll see."
"Let me finish."
"Can you explain to me?"
"To protect you."
"Nice work."
"Is that enough for you?"
"Thank you, my angel."
"They disappeared."
"Got it?"
"Make him talk."
"Do the math."
"It makes you think."
"That would be cool."
"I am delighted."
"I am kind."
"And your husband?"
"Neither do they."
"No lizard."
"Right next door."
"Have a good trip."
"Have a good trip."
"I was curious."
"It will be quick."
"And the house?"
"That surprises me."
"Under cover."
"Go in peace."
"Not forever."
"Take a left."
"Everything is here."
"Come on, boys."
"I like you."
"You are different."
"Will it take long?"
"Choose one."
"No water."
"And here it is."
"Are you busy?"
"Where is Sara?"
"Do you have it?"
"Let's talk about you."
"Nobody listens."
"Are you a virgin?"
"Watch your back."
"I'll try again."
"My little brother."
"I'm just asking."
"Let him come."
"Okay, man."
"Where does she live?"
"Yeah, let's go."
"It will be fun."
"Do you live together?"
"They are hungry."
"It's deserted."
"Not like you."
"I am shy."
"We should talk."
"Goodbye, baby."
"You messed up."
"Do you take it?"
"Eat a little."
"All right, listen."
"Come on, let's move on."
"What about my stuff?"
"Let's take it slow."
"He looks like you."
"Like my mother."
"That'll teach him."
"So to speak."
"We do this."
"Will it take long?"
"We're taking him on board."
"I am a vegetarian."
"I am a photographer."
"On the left."
"We live together."
"We are together."
"Do you speak French?"
"Have you heard?"
"Where do I sign?"
"Are you going to talk?"
"I think I understand."
"A little bit, yeah."
"I'll replace you."
"It was simple."
"Hold on."
"You stay there."
"Gradually."
"Hello, boys."
"These things happen."
"Have you been drinking?"
"But still."
"And the boy?"
"I will contact you."
"I would like to understand."
"We are brothers."
"I am nobody."
"Are you sure?"
"Not even me."
"Here, look at this."
"She's screwed."
"Let's call the police."
"I'm betting everything."
"There are two of us."
"Come home with me."
"You are perfect."
"Your Honor."
"Anything but that."
"Not like us."
"We are the same."
"Fasten your seatbelt."
"Fasten your seatbelt."
"How can you?"
"What are you wearing?"
"Oh, look at this."
"It's hereditary."
"Got it?"
"And my family?"
"Where is Nick?"
"Get them out."
"Did you ring?"
"Where is Ray?"
"Tell us."
"I know that."
"Well what?"
"You are wonderful."
"She is hungry."
"You're soaked."
"In a bar."
"I buy it."
"Do you forgive me?"
"Just one."
"You are being watched."
"Lots of people."
"Suddenly."
"She wakes up."
"Let's start there."
"I admire him."
"It's symbolic."
"Do you like it?"
"Did you understand?"
"Thanks, man."
"I am innocent."
"Maybe never."
"If you only knew."
"And with that?"
"It brings luck."
"In ten minutes."
"I'll see."
"Get in line."
"Wait your turn."
"Not bad at all."
"Wherever you want."
"Here's your share."
"Listen to me carefully."
"No one will know."
"What are you implying?"
"What are you implying?"
"Now or never."
"Look a little."
"Where was she?"
"Show them to me."
"I am strong."
"I am strong."
"Like all of you."
"My grandmother."
"Bring him here."
"Step back a little."
"Not a drop."
"Take a right."
"Meat."
"From my father."
"Are you coming back?"
"Where were you going?"
"Where is Bobby?"
"Let her do it."
"What was he doing?"
"It will be."
"Farewell, my love."
"You're burning hot."
"He works here."
"What does this mean?"
"Would you like that?"
"A new life."
"Who has it?"
"Are you going to stay?"
"By the Gods."
"It's political."
"Are you happy?"
"I'm going swimming."
"I'll bring it back."
"Pretty cool, huh?"
"I'm coming, Mom."
"Do you recognize this?"
"But where?"
"Me, me, me."
"At the library."
"Oh yes, yes."
"Keep your eyes open."
"And those?"
"Good luck, sir."
"Let him breathe."
"You, come here."
"On your marks."
"I will sign."
"Look over there."
"Nobody understands."
"And in exchange?"
"Let's have fun."
"It was terrifying."
"I marry you."
"Exactly like that."
"Good, good, good."
"Like his mother."
"Everything will be fine."
"Take mine."
"Take mine."
"I live there."
"Do you like it?"
"In broad daylight?"
"On the beach."
"Can we continue?"
"Something is coming."
"You mean?"
"I'm high."
"You're pretty."
"To the family."
"No contact."
"I would like to know."
"Who is who?"
"It's effective."
"I am a surgeon."
"She was fine."
"I'm good."
"His condition is getting worse."
"Tell me that again."
"I would be fine."
"On the right."
"Have you decided?"
"Everything is OK."
"I am proud."
"Let her pass."
"Not a penny."
"You can try."
"Smell that."
"I understand everything."
"One or two."
"It was fabulous."
"And dinner?"
"How many victims?"
"And your name?"
"Safe and sound."
"This is Will."
"I was pretending."
"They are arguing."
"They are perfect."
"It intrigues me."
"It really works."
"So, see you tomorrow."
"Have you checked?"
"A little gift."
"We will go together."
"In the forest."
"Heroin."
"Get in the car."
"And your son?"
"Come back later."
"Let's wait a bit."
"In Los Angeles."
"Which one?"
"Sure, come in."
"I held him."
"How does it work?"
"I will find you again."
"He was sick."
"We will find them."
"No calls."
"Take the message."
"No one will come."
"It was us."
"Where is Will?"
"She is real."
"And what about?"
"Take one."
"Right behind you."
"Are you awake?"
"Come on, let's continue."
"That makes three."
"Don't apologize."
"He is shy."
"We'll call you."
"Thank you my love."
"I have them."
"What do we want?"
"You have to go home."
"Where is Billy?"
"I don't look."
"Look at his face."
"Here it is."
"Let's have a drink."
"I was just asking."
"No, I'm coming."
"He moved."
"Come on, let's move."
"Go back home."
"Good night, doctor."
"He's pretending."
"Miami Police."
"We will call you back."
"And the kid?"
"Take a seat."
"Look at yourself."
"We're in it."
"You're kind."
"And the mother?"
"Everything seems normal."
"Go ahead, open it."
"But you do."
"No, sit down."
"No injuries?"
"To your health."
"Tomorrow afternoon."
"I was going out."
"Your girlfriend?"
"Put on your coat."
"Dynamite."
"You are awesome."
"What about security?"
"We get used to it."
"It's scientific."
"Come see me."
"You know who?"
"It is preferable."
"No, thank you very much."
"Why always me?"
"Did she call?"
"Where do you live?"
"Where do you live?"
"What do you decide?"
"In the fridge."
"Just to know."
"Look at this place."
"Hello, my brother."
"Welcome."
"Next year."
"You are responsible."
"She loves him."
"It's common."
"Open a channel."
"Not the police."
"Here is the situation."
"Why say that?"
"A true gentleman."
"It's amazing."
"We are surrounded."
"You must stay."
"It wasn't necessary."
"No names."
"Two more."
"I'll catch up with you."
"Not with him."
"No, stay there."
"I want mom."
"They loved it."
"What a nice surprise."
"Do you want to have lunch?"
"Lots of stuff."
"Do you want me?"
"Do you want to talk?"
"Do you want to touch?"
"For fun."
"For fun."
"Further to the right."
"She is free."
"Not even true."
"The wheel turns."
"Are you satisfied?"
"Tell us everything."
"Take a cigar."
"Let's go to bed."
"Say hello to him."
"Do you know what?"
"Do you know how to play?"
"We will have tried."
"Yes, this way."
"So say it."
"I'll catch up with you."
"Live your life."
"All of them, without exception."
"It's sincere."
"Doctor's order."
"I am immortal."
"I want to come back."
"What am I doing?"
"You're cute."
"Yes, sweetie."
"I don't understand."
"Her name is?"
"You must know."
"It's imminent."
"No, thank God."
"In the shower."
"She is everywhere."
"Business is booming."
"Yeah, mate."
"I hope so."
"A good man."
"Turn your head."
"For the baby."
"She is unique."
"Where is Eric?"
"A car arrives."
"She's finished."
"Not to you."
"Not yours."
"What do you want?"
"You repeat yourself."
"She is delicious."
"You stay here."
"Good night, then."
"Including you."
"And love?"
"It relaxes me."
"I threw up."
"Well, maybe."
"What are they saying?"
"Find something else."
"What was he like?"
"You're going to laugh."
"You are finished."
"Look up."
"Just us."
"Does that bother you?"
"What are you writing?"
"I'll wait outside."
"No, later."
"Wait two seconds."
"I see, yes."
"Are you looking for this?"
"Are you looking for this?"
"Are you letting go of me?"
"They were."
"Did you love him?"
"Hello, Grandma."
"No, this way."
"Watch out for yourself."
"And then what?"
"Yes, that one."
"And what then?"
"What were they doing?"
"She moved."
"Oh, I forgot."
"No one comes in."
"It's been a long time."
"Where is who?"
"It's about time."
"I'm soaked."
"Last year."
"My sincere condolences."
"You're not answering?"
"I have to go."
"I am an inspector."
"Him or me?"
"He can stay."
"Is this fair?"
"Where is Maggie?"
"It was exciting."
"I am touched."
"Turn on the TV."
"All my best wishes."
"It's final."
"Who wants to know?"
"She came."
"Hey, how are you?"
"Mom loves you."
"On the bridge."
"Do you know how?"
"Hi, darling."
"I tell him."
"You are fine."
"Don't you see?"
"God is great."
"Put it on me."
"One last drink?"
"You have to try."
"You surprise me."
"Which one do you want?"
"You're a cop."
"Accused, stand up."
"For work."
"Where is she going?"
"How much is it worth?"
"But listen to me."
"Right over there."
"As much as possible."
"Your boyfriend?"
"Let's party."
"You see clearly."
"You can continue."
"Why there?"
"At all costs."
"Oh, there she is."
"Do you know where?"
"I will talk to them."
"I answered."
"And more."
"In any case."
"More than you."
"This is Amy."
"Oh, my baby."
"Is she here?"
"Here, drink this."
"Farewell, my friend."
"Okay, go ahead."
"What can I tell you?"
"And your job?"
"Sorry for everything."
"We'll manage."
"Honor to the ladies."
"No, no way."
"Open your eyes."
"He loved her."
"See you tomorrow then."
"Lower your voice."
"I have to work."
"Take this one."
"In a second."
"But not her."
"If I want."
"Have a drink."
"Are you new?"
"Maybe nothing."
"It's historic."
"We can wait."
"It was grand."
"He is conscious."
"Can we talk?"
"And as a drink?"
"An eye for an eye."
"What do we tell?"
"Is this you?"
"Thank you, my dear."
"Thank you, Captain."
"He was innocent."
"I wanted to know."
"He is blocked."
"They love each other."
"No sex."
"OK, that works."
"Another beer?"
"What about, then?"
"For this time."
"I'm available."
"And it continues."
"Keep watch."
"Choose one."
"It relieves me."
"Do your job."
"Do you recognize this?"
"I moved."
"Hello, Mr. Phelps."
"He will be there."
"You will know."
"I would really like to."
"A young man."
"In the mountains."
"I repeat."
"Do you love me?"
"For what occasion?"
"I am God."
"Here is the police."
"I promise."
"Yes, I understand."
"Think about that."
"We were together."
"When is she coming back?"
"Thank you, my heart."
"You are smart."
"You are smart."
"Why not him?"
"Not the least."
"I'm done for."
"Yes, Your Highness."
"I'll tell you."
"But be careful."
"Let's drink to that."
"I'm going to dance."
"You learn quickly."
"Keep talking."
"She is tall."
"Thank you very much, madam."
"Oh, my darling."
"Are you getting there?"
"Go get ready."
"Yes, actually."
"Including me."
"He was looking for you."
"I have sinned."
"What am I saying?"
"I will be careful."
"We will succeed."
"He must know."
"Thank you, my heart."
"Oh, you know."
"What are they?"
"Lockable."
"Come on, it's okay."
"It was long."
"Follow your instinct."
"There are three of us."
"Stay alert."
"Do you want to have dinner?"
"Let's go somewhere."
"In the elevator."
"Maybe three."
"Do you speak German?"
"She was perfect."
"You are good."
"You're good."
"You're good."
"Do you recognize them?"
"And the work?"
"Much better, thank you."
"He stops."
"One for you."
"They are amazing."
"I set you free."
"Here is the money."
"We are full."
"Where does he live?"
"I was sincere."
"Are you Catholic?"
"Yes, but where?"
"And look at this."
"Bring her to me."
"It's cooked."
"I have to go in."
"As you see."
"Where are they going?"
"Where are they going?"
"Don't push me."
"Raise your head."
"I keep them."
"In three days."
"You have to come back."
"Continue straight ahead."
"So, good night."
"Should I continue?"
"And here we are."
"Trust us."
"Ask me what?"
"We'll talk later."
"Now you know."
"Is she serious?"
"It's exceptional."
"At the shopping center."
"He will get there."
"They won."
"Thank you."
"It's getting closer."
"Not so easy."
"Bring her here."
"Who's up for it?"
"I ate."
"Find something."
"Towards the south."
"We're leaving tomorrow."
"What does she want?"
"To see you."
"See you later, man."
"Not his."
"That is the question."
"Take a room."
"I want to work."
"Not without me."
"Light."
"I have to."
"Oh really, why?"
"We hope so."
"Can I see?"
"Do you have anything better?"
"They call me."
"I see why."
"I travel a lot."
"He was married."
"I'm getting closer."
"We'll talk tomorrow."
"All my best wishes."
"And this guy?"
"Are you hot?"
"We're working on it."
"Did you understand?"
"Are you waiting for me?"
"Are you single?"
"Come on, take it."
"Do you come often?"
"And you, madam?"
"Hold on tight."
"From me."
"He's still running."
"Are you looking at me?"
"So do this."
"And your mom?"
"Walk with me."
"You'll understand."
"Will I see you again?"
"I was waiting for it."
"Are you getting divorced?"
"I am real."
"All right, go on."
"I will continue."
"Can I call?"
"You never know."
"Let's find out."
"You said?"
"Are you going far?"
"We entered."
"I can check."
"Take off your coat."
"And before that?"
"Stay home."
"Are you taking it?"
"I went out."
"He does it."
"No way."
"Come to my house."
"I want to watch."
"What is his name?"
"For two reasons."
"Look up there."
"I support you."
"Well done, guys."
"And the men?"
"No police."
"Where is Kyle?"
"Good luck, gentlemen."
"Except you."
"No jokes."
"You are brave."
"When will it be?"
"I am a pilot."
"Look down."
"Let them in."
"Thank you, Your Highness."
"From the inside."
"We'll see about that."
"You know who."
"No need to shout."
"I'm walking."
"No wonder."
"Let's go to your house."
"She won."
"We'll see tomorrow."
"You disappeared."
"Sorry for what?"
"I must be dreaming."
"Just a hunch."
"Like your mother."
"She is a doctor."
"It helps me."
"Ready for what?"
"How much do you have?"
"Drink a little."
"Are you coming?"
"All except one."
"I say no."
"Until the last one."
"And how so?"
"The bells are ringing."
"Welcome home."
"Who's going?"
"Love?"
"Yes, tonight."
"No reaction."
"All this time."
"They say so."
"Not fast enough."
"For you, yes."
"Special Agent Gibbs."
"That's something else."
"I am delighted."
"I will be ready."
"Shall I wake you up?"
"I can imagine."
"Are you serious?"
"You should answer."
"I am gifted."
"No car."
"I have booked."
"We're cool."
"Are you watching me?"
"Keep trying."
"When do we eat?"
"Even so."
"Good night, son."
"Nice day, isn't it?"
"Watch over her."
"It's going to get cold."
"I am a detective."
"We love it."
"We remain calm."
"Yes, see you tomorrow."
"They adore you."
"I was serious."
"And here you are."
"And here you are."
"You're kind."
"How many years?"
"It's face."
"Come on, big guy."
"There you go, my dear."
"Right, honey?"
"What does that prove?"
"How many children?"
"Let's go back."
"But how to do it?"
"Take one."
"Come on, get up."
"No body."
"Can we start again?"
"Mr. Mayor."
"Mr. Mayor."
"We work together."
"I want to come in."
"Go back to work."
"Nothing exceptional."
"Discuss what?"
"Not for a moment."
"I'm going down there."
"He forgot."
"From the visit."
"You are splendid."
"Have you smoked?"
"We were."
"And for him?"
"We're having a blast."
"Yes, I hope so."
"I am mean."
"All is forgiven."
"Come on, you two."
"It's classy."
"Not to us."
"We'll be back soon."
"I want to win."
"You have to eat."
"You were awesome."
"Nobody knew."
"And the little one?"
"Right, Dad?"
"Pass me that."
"I guarantee it."
"Quite the opposite."
"This is Ray."
"Is it serious?"
"Ah, of course."
"Put that there."
"It was them."
"Never heard of it."
"In the park."
"I'm going outside."
"Bring him to me."
"I know it well."
"What would that change?"
"And the cops?"
"Open your eyes."
"Watch me do it."
"Move on."
"They are watching us."
"It is clean."
"We got divorced."
"I'm hanging on."
"Do your homework."
"It's guaranteed."
"We have this."
"But look at this."
"But look at this."
"I called."
"And your children?"
"He is brilliant."
"Go ahead, come in."
"No one in particular."
"They will be."
"Just one thing."
"I will know."
"It's inexplicable."
"Sure, yeah."
"Good people."
"Snow."
"Here's the deal."
"It's a gift."
"As if by chance."
"Let's make peace."
"We are locked up."
"Get out of here."
"Look at it carefully."
"About?"
"Better than good."
"Wait for my orders."
"One more thing."
"Of course, boss."
"I'll bring her back."
"You'd better."
"No music."
"Largely."
"It's out of the question."
"I am young."
"Other than that."
"It's useful."
"What's new?"
"Raise your head."
"We are friends."
"They are perfect."
"Sorry for you."
"Thank you, young man."
"Think of me."
"Let's go get them."
"We look alike."
"Thank you very much, doctor."
"You were."
"Go ahead, kid."
"She doesn't answer."
"I'm resting."
"Stand guard."
"She is a virgin."
"Right in the middle."
"Yes, I love it."
"Stay the course."
"How much do you want?"
"You are unique."
"Have you tried?"
"Got it?"
"You are amazing."
"I was going there."
"Where else?"
"What shall we do?"
"Just a word."
"Take my car."
"Take my car."
"He approaches."
"She was pretty."
"I'm awesome."
"In the back."
"I'm fucked."
"Where do you live?"
"Where do you live?"
"Always a pleasure."
"It will be done."
"Thank you, you too."
"Ten thousand dollars."
"I canceled."
"What are you writing?"
"What are you writing?"
"Not this week."
"No secrets."
"It's special."
"In a month."
"What did she want?"
"When is she coming back?"
"Look at that."
"I envy him."
"And your daughter?"
"She stays here."
"What was she doing?"
"You go ahead."
"Are you surprised?"
"Take off your glasses."
"Tell him that."
"Hello, sweetie."
"How do we proceed?"
"Can I continue?"
"How am I?"
"You are wonderful."
"Keep reading."
"I will come back soon."
"You promised."
"How could I?"
"You are asked."
"I entered."
"For your safety."
"We will have it."
"Come on, my dear."
"Let them come in."
"They are hiding."
"Dad is right."
"Okay, that's fine."
"I concentrate."
"We'll start again."
"This is Eric."
"Wait your turn."
"Need me?"
"We're withdrawing."
"Nineteen years old."
"A nice boy."
"In part, yes."
"Do you want to trade?"
"He will know."
"And your friend?"
"What do you think?"
"What do you think?"
"Are you getting married?"
"Are you coming with us?"
"I will find them."
"And your hand?"
"It stands up."
"You didn't know that?"
"Give the order."
"In a sense."
"In a way."
"We'll call you back."
"They are looking at us."
"We will find her."
"Turn off the power."
"Just an idea."
"No, believe me."
"For a while now."
"So tell me."
"That's cute."
"And I understand."
"I am cured."
"We are free."
"Go tell him."
"No, tell me."
"Look at this picture."
"Look at this picture."
"Go with him."
"What are they like?"
"Where was it?"
"In two minutes."
"He is strong."
"Okay, see you later."
"And you?"
"He was different."
"When the time comes."
"Your name, sir?"
"And the dog?"
"He slipped."
"What are you hiding?"
"Can you move?"
"No exceptions."
"I worked."
"Are you joining us?"
"Not this year."
"You're cooked."
"I'll be home soon."
"Do you want to drink?"
"Keep calm."
"I totally understand."
"Just me."
"Let's raise our glasses."
"Three or four."
"I am engaged."
"Let's go see her."
"Pure and simple."
"Not yours."
"I am diabetic."
"Not with this."
"What did you want?"
"What did you want?"
"How do they do it?"
"It's mathematical."
"I had been drinking."
"Great work."
"She started."
"Go ahead, son."
"A big smile."
"Ask your questions."
"He is white."
"Don't wait."
"Take a card."
"It's fresh."
"It's dark."
"And in the meantime?"
"I shot."
"No, not for me."
"I will find it."
"See you soon."
"Aspirin."
"Find something else."
"When will we arrive?"
"Should I open it?"
"Thank you, ma'am."
"Call someone."
"Where does that come from?"
"And the body?"
"I have arrived."
"Yes, this morning."
"Amen, my brother."
"Down."
"Do you know how to drive?"
"Hold her tight."
"Let me finish."
"We'll make do."
"For the road."
"Not enough yet."
"Take my advice."
"Still as beautiful."
"And the photos?"
"An eye for an eye."
"I was happy."
"I was happy."
"You would be surprised."
"Who shouted?"
"You are surrounded."
"She survived."
"Pull down your pants."
"He is honest."
"Get ready."
"Where is Gibbs?"
"It seems so."
"It must work."
"Yes, I want to."
"Find a solution."
"Find a solution."
"Play with me."
"I had to leave."
"It was unfair."
"You did great."
"Put on your jacket."
"Did you speak?"
"Old-fashioned."
"God keep you."
"You, for example."
"It's soon."
"Good luck, man."
"I recognize her."
"With pleasure, sir."
"I bow."
"I have to go back."
"This is Carrie."
"Look for yourself."
"What are you studying?"
"Yes, over there."
"I want to learn."
"Good job."
"You are soaked."
"You are lucky."
"Stay with her."
"Let's do something."
"Match point."
"It's blue."
"I'll call her back."
"Not from here."
"Sure of what?"
"We were happy."
"They are good."
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"Can we come?"
"The first time?"
"You are doing well."
"Try it and see."
"Try it and see."
"So what to do?"
"How many are there?"
"Late again."
"I will give it to him."
"Another round."
"Bring her up."
"For what reasons?"
"Everything is organized."
"Like this one."
"Swear it to me."
"It will be nice."
"You are special."
"You are special."
"Place of birth?"
"We'll meet again."
"I'll be there."
"Pray for us."
"At the morgue."
"In the drawer."
"I'll fix that."
"Yes, my friend."
"Call your mother."
"No, let it go."
"You must live."
"Don't you think so?"
"They are looking for us."
"Yes, my brother."
"Hey, come here."
"Can we go out?"
"Who are you?"
"I take it off."
"So, guys?"
"Our apologies."
"She has to go."
"Goodbye then."
"I authorize it."
"Get me out."
"We tried."
"You can watch."
"You can watch."
"Let's give it a try."
"I listened."
"If you only knew."
"With my father."
"You are mean."
"Too many people."
"We will be there."
"Or what?"
"Here is the answer."
"I will find you."
"Are you happy?"
"Is this enough?"
"Are you a writer?"
"I don't sleep."
"We need to think."
"Sorry, friend."
"But it happens."
"Like a man."
"Yes, here it is."
"Even for you."
"Please sign here."
"Go with them."
"Let me come."
"Do you hear them?"
"This is the commander."
"And for us?"
"She adores me."
"No market."
"The other hand."
"He can wait."
"He is real."
"Did you come?"
"No point in resisting."
"Go quickly."
"Are you receiving us?"
"No more gas."
"Huh, guys?"
"Can we talk?"
"Are you finished?"
"I am captain."
"They understood."
"Healthy."
"I'll open the door for you."
"Call emergency services."
"Will you show me?"
"This is Jim."
"You will succeed."
"We are still looking."
"You can pass."
"Not mine."
"Are you coming too?"
"I dream about it."
"Where will you be?"
"Where will you be?"
"He started again."
"He looks at us."
"If it works."
"Why do you ask?"
"Sorry about what?"
"The whole family."
"Where is Joey?"
"Open the gate."
"I greet you."
"He's looking for you."
"Let's do it like this."
"He jumped."
"Let's talk a little."
"Oh, never mind."
"Do you love him?"
"All in softness."
"I read a lot."
"All right, honey."
"I am homosexual."
"No point in arguing."
"Are you going?"
"Occasionally."
"What are you doing?"
"Yeah, and you?"
"Well, good night."
"They are married."
"Thank you, uncle."
"Let me go up."
"What do you hear?"
"You can choose."
"Come on, let's play."
"Goodbye, Mother."
"I understand that."
"What does he know?"
"What do you mean, gone?"
"They are there."
"You are being unfair."
"Be sure of it."
"Someone comes in."
"Don't say that."
"Give me that."
"It's everywhere."
"Hold your breath."
"She is still asleep."
"Take your chance."
"Welcome to paradise."
"They are nice."
"Look at all this."
"Look a little."
"And marriage?"
"Let's go to the bar."
"Everything else."
"I have to study."
"What are you talking about?"
"Do you speak French?"
"One of us."
"You're burning hot."
"No, keep it."
"Not much."
"On the boat."
"Stick out your tongue."
"We have to move."
"I want to continue."
"I am everywhere."
"I love it."
"End of messages."
"You must sign."
"Look, I understand."
"Come and get it."
"Who is 'us'?"
"I will find her again."
"Let's make love."
"You will thank me."
"We are different."
"In the cellar."
"I know how to do it."
"About it."
"Do you understand it?"
"Everything is working out."
"You are free."
"I'll do with it."
"Just one night."
"Who will win?"
"For tonight."
"How far?"
"She was young."
"How does she do it?"
"Good night, honey."
"My best friend."
"We survived."
"Everything is different."
"Let's wait and see."
"No luck."
"Of course, thank you."
"He is single."
"Good evening, my dear."
"Goodbye, son."
"Do you believe her?"
"Since high school."
"Girl or boy?"
"I had heard."
"Enjoy it."
"I was outside."
"Who are you calling?"
"No room."
"We meet again."
"Happy Valentine's Day."
"State your price."
"Let's go upstairs."
"Who is against?"
"A while."
"That you believe."
"It's red."
"Very good work."
"Very nice work."
"Do you want a divorce?"
"She moved."
"Go ahead, sir."
"Officer ashore."
"Give it to him."
"Not even you."
"I'm improving."
"Can I start?"
"Ah, I understand."
"I was protecting you."
"Here is our man."
"A beautiful woman."
"Save your strength."
"She was different."
"It's been a long time."
"It will be quick."
"Watch the door."
"For later."
"Sheriff's Office."
"I'm counting on it."
"He will listen to you."
"Let me in."
"He is human."
"And where?"
"Can you read?"
"Shall we tell him?"
"And the water?"
"They are excellent."
"Keep working."
"When do you start?"
"I will call him back."
"All right, man."
"Good work."
"Pretty cool, right?"
"Don't think."
"Lower your voice."
"And one."
"This time."
"I thought so."
"We are adults."
"I know, man."
"Where is Rick?"
"This is your room."
"She was nice."
"Almost a year."
"She was there."
"Yes, indeed."
"She ignores him."
"It escapes me."
"I already know."
"She is going to give birth."
"And for her?"
"Oh, you think so?"
"Where is Scylla?"
"Of course, Mom."
"I am optimistic."
"She grew up."
"You can feel it."
"You're an early riser."
"It will be fun."
"Close your eyes."
"The end is near."
"Afterwards, we'll see."
"As always, right?"
"I must continue."
"What do I know?"
"And the boys?"
"Your name again?"
"Soup?"
"Let's take a picture."
"We're leaving now."
"This one too."
"Who is asking me?"
"She is mean."
"Which one do you want?"
"Any other ideas?"
"I'm trembling."
"Enjoy it."
"In the future."
"And yours?"
"Very lucky."
"Take two."
"Okay, come on."
"It's wet."
"I'm watching her."
"Not both."
"Why this name?"
"Tell us."
"Ready for what?"
"Right, darling?"
"A last wish?"
"What were you waiting for?"
"You'll like it."
"You will love it."
"And for good reason."
"No, I work."
"Just imagine."
"Outside."
"You will see it."
"It was hilarious."
"But how so?"
"Do you want to order?"
"Got it?"
"Put that there."
"Take your chance."
"I'm going up front."
"Do your best."
"Pick up the phone."
"I'm walking around."
"Yes, my friend."
"Are you arguing?"
"He lives here."
"He is still asleep."
"Hi, Grandma."
"Sorry, my friend."
"I will do that."
"We loved each other."
"There you go, very good."
"She deserves better."
"Are you covering for me?"
"Thank you, friends."
"For a year."
"Oh, never mind."
"I wonder."
"Nothing concrete."
"Take off your jacket."
"No details."
"What were you hoping for?"
"Not for a long time."
"Go change."
"Are you ready?"
"What was she saying?"
"Research."
"Are you busy?"
"She works here."
"Oh, there you are."
"What are we looking for?"
"For his own good."
"She is clever."
"This is Hank."
"Get in there."
"He was perfect."
"Are you English?"
"No, let's go."
"And your leg?"
"Take a message."
"But be careful."
"But be careful."
"A very small one."
"Which one do you prefer?"
"Do you know how to dance?"
"At the right time."
"What are you implying?"
"We're outside."
"They are delicious."
"It's rough."
"For what, then?"
"Who am I?"
"Good luck, then."
"Come see me."
"Do you want to continue?"
"Hold on tight."
"Hold her tight."
"It's Monday."
"I am a musician."
"Are you married?"
"Turn on the light."
"Are you in a hurry?"
"You're good."
"Your turn will come."
"Do you want to come?"
"Have a beer."
"What do you choose?"
"He is watching us."
"Good news?"
"Change the disc."
"For us too."
"Are you new?"
"Look at the date."
"Put them there."
"She can't."
"Would that suit you?"
"I hope so too."
"He is telling the truth."
"Don't listen."
"Leave it there."
"It happens to him."
"You stay."
"We love you."
"It could happen."
"Where is Jim?"
"We are happy."
"I will pass it on to him."
"No dial tone."
"Can you hear us?"
"Come, my son."
"What do they have?"
"Go ahead, eat."
"In the box."
"Well, hello."
"Do it quickly."
"Which one is it?"
"Which one is it?"
"It's Italian."
"It is necessary."
"I'm exhausted."
"Go ahead, try it."
"Stay a while."
"A nice girl."
"I am normal."
"Now that's enough."
"Not before tomorrow."
"How many days?"
"Where is Julia?"
"He adored her."
"The doctor arrives."
"The last time."
"Of course, come in."
"We think so."
"I'm decided."
"I will go tomorrow."
"They are human."
"I can fly."
"And you."
"We were young."
"Here are the keys."
"On the bed."
"Let's take a tour."
"Don't ask."
"I deserved it."
"What do you propose?"
"Turn off the engine."
"You can answer."
"She is terrified."
"You have arrived."
"Yeah, we'll see."
"Oh, you're welcome."
"Look at my face."
"Are we coming soon?"
"I am healed."
"You should eat."
"What are you wearing?"
"Pray for him."
"Go see her."
"They are together."
"He's waiting outside."
"I'll catch up with you."
"Let's start with that."
"In this house."
"And the husband?"
"I can iron."
"Do you know where?"
"Come on, boys."
"No light."
"No cops."
"They separate."
"Your phone rings."
"Where are you?"
"She was happy."
"This is my father."
"Like mine."
"It's hot."
"One on one."
"I hear everything."
"Do we say that?"
"I call her back."
"Do you love me?"
"Let's make a baby."
"Let's make a pact."
"I must act."
"No more questions."
"I set you free."
"It's God."
"It's sublime."
"Take my place."
"To all of you."
"Praise be to Buddha."
"To others."
"In the eyes."
"Many times."
"Half a million."
"This is Maggie."
"You were friends?"
"Very good, perfect."
"I was free."
"Let's do it together."
"Are you in?"
"We saw."
"Where is Bob?"
"You came back."
"One, two, three."
"Go behind."
"This is my husband."
"Here it is."
"In the hall."
"Do you speak Spanish?"
"From my mother."
"Right or left?"
"They are happy."
"I know, baby."
"And your sister?"
"On paper."
"A normal life."
"Wait a minute."
"This is Barry."
"I collect them."
"Are you going to work?"
"Who are you asking?"
"And with whom?"
"Here is the key."
"Where are you going?"
"On the stomach."
"And be careful."
"We were there."
"We were there."
"When are we leaving?"
"He's talking to me."
"Again and again."
"And not you?"
"Talked about what?"
"I did."
"Can you open?"
"Who are you looking for?"
"For a while."
"Don't do it."
"Are you sleeping together?"
"Are you training?"
"I wish so."
"Can you imagine that?"
"You are an adult."
"Try it a little."
"Everything is important."
"Go back and sit down."
"And my daughter?"
"She was gone."
"Come back and see me."
"Look at it carefully."
"In the courtyard."
"She has it."
"Thank you, my dear."
"Look at my eyes."
"Does that come back to you?"
"It's getting serious."
"Finish your drink."
"Go around back."
"Yes, yes, yes."
"He was awesome."
"She is stuck."
"How does she do it?"
"Two, actually."
"Can you be more specific?"
"Can you be more specific?"
"No, sit down."
"A storm is approaching."
"Open the iris."
"We'll fix that."
"She was awesome."
"They will love it."
"Give it to me."
"No prisoners."
"Oh, sweetie."
"It's Thursday."
"She's looking for you."
"For my father."
"Like this one."
"It's paid."
"You are in love."
"It's secure."
"Go ask him."
"Good afternoon."
"Not from you."
"It's fair."
"Let's go find him."
"Yes, it happens."
"Why do you ask?"
"A good guy."
"A good guy."
"We were right."
"That would make sense."
"Take this money."
"How do you say?"
"I can continue."
"When is it coming?"
"You love each other."
"What are you drinking?"
"Two against one."
"Teamwork."
"You will be fine."
"Wait a moment."
"Take my card."
"I had to come."
"Take the wheel."
"It's vital."
"We work together."
"He was nice."
"We have it."
"You are forgiven."
"Mom is right."
"I was stuck."
"Never seen that."
"Where is Elena?"
"How did you know?"
"Park there."
"It's healthy."
"There, you see?"
"Make love."
"Thank you, children."
"Unlike you."
"Take care of yourself."
"I'm going to resign."
"I know it."
"The children are sleeping."
"Go ahead, answer."
"Speak less loudly."
"Where do we start?"
"Hello, my little one."
"Good evening, boys."
"Did you feel it?"
"Where is Hank?"
"What are we?"
"I'll guess."
"In that order."
"Mom is fine."
"We are silent."
"We can begin."
"He's having fun."
"But not that."
"Bring it to me."
"You were great."
"Are you surprised?"
"It works too."
"When is he coming back?"
"And our agreement?"
"You're sexy."
"They do."
"You have to get out."
"This story again?"
"I'll find some."
"I feel you."
"Better than what?"
"You must come."
"How do we get out?"
"For all that."
"In what field?"
"You were gone."
"Take my advice."
"You are repeating yourself."
"It is off."
"I wake up."
"Are you hot?"
"No, before that."
"He follows us."
"You're welcome, sir."
"Open the door."
"It's powerful."
"What will you do?"
"No sermon."
"You, maybe."
"Stand up straight."
"Can you breathe?"
"Based on what?"
"Take over."
"But for what?"
"She's pretending."
"Anyone know."
"All these people."
"I'll join you."
"Two more minutes."
"And for whom?"
"Are you finished?"
"Are you American?"
"Let's take a taxi."
"This is Olivia."
"She is brilliant."
"No argument."
"And even more."
"Thank you, my son."
"Go straight ahead."
"Stay like that."
"He's a cop."
"Do you think so too?"
"Calm down, kid."
"How to say this?"
"You can go down."
"Right at the top."
"He is extraordinary."
"What to do?"
"It's professional."
"Everything was perfect."
"Yes, here it is."
"Yeah, see you later."
"Look behind you."
"She is heavy."
"I am retired."
"Where?"
"And your girlfriend?"
"What a lovely name."
"I'm fair."
"You, maybe."
"Keep playing."
"Two or three."
"It's all over."
"Yes, I believe so."
"You are responsible."
"She will be there."
"Welcome, my brother."
"For my birthday."
"It is."
"It's started."
"It's harmless."
"In this room."
"Dance with me."
"We'll talk again."
"Here, for you."
"In the pocket."
"Thank you, my boy."
"I'm looking at you."
"He's tough."
"Make him come."
"To all of us."
"Oh, my boy."
"And your children?"
"Here is one."
"Where were you going?"
"Go have fun."
"I always win."
"What do I wear?"
"She is waiting for us."
"Not mine."
"We'll join you."
"But it works."
"So, this trip?"
"Unlike us."
"You'll laugh."
"They like it."
"You are superb."
"Well done, sir."
"We are called."
"You don't know?"
"Around what time?"
"It's trendy."
"More tea?"
"Sorry, what were you saying?"
"She insisted."
"I can take it."
"Let's say yes."
"I kiss you."
"What about?"
"Sorry about yesterday."
"He is American."
"Quite the opposite."
"I am a nurse."
"They are watching us."
"You do it."
"And business?"
"Look at his face."
"The usual stuff."
"In your office."
"She looks at us."
"We worked together."
"It will be better."
"Look at the road."
"Everything is the same."
"Just a coffee."
"Gasoline."
"Were you there?"
"Do something."
"Have you seen?"
"Everything is beautiful."
"It's new."
"Until tomorrow."
"In the center."
"I am a medium."
"Tell me again."
"On the back."
"It was brave."
"I challenge you."
"Open a frequency."
"I do this."
"Who lives here?"
"Do you have it?"
"Don't drink."
"Think about that."
"No one passes."
"Another part?"
"Just a drop."
"This can wait."
"Underwater."
"It's unreal."
"Are we doing business?"
"No need to insist."
"Here, take it."
"A good time."
"This is Mr."
"I work here."
"They were arguing."
"What did you think?"
"A good point."
"Don't push."
"Look at his eyes."
"You are extraordinary."
"You or me?"
"Do you have this?"
"Any side effects?"
"Shall we go out?"
"You should sleep."
"They will be there."
"Yes, but what?"
"We are the same."
"Take up your weapons."
"Sorry, guys."
"None of them."
"A quick question."
"That would be cool."
"The basement."
"End of line."
"We were."
"He is French."
"Let her talk."
"We share everything."
"Driving license."
"We'll discuss it."
"Let's ask him."
"We are still looking."
"Not yours."
"Find a way."
"Here you are."
"He is sensitive."
"You love it."
"A real miracle."
"Not there."
"I'm a widow."
"Secure the perimeter."
"I am different."
"Want to check?"
"Step back a little."
"Stay there."
"A real beauty."
"Exactly like you."
"A little what?"
"The other day."
"You smell good."
"I'll be quick."
"I am reassured."
"On both sides."
"On the plane."
"What type?"
"You are perfect."
"And thank you again."
"We're watching you."
"You came."
"Do you remember?"
"I have to ask."
"In his car."
"Is this understood?"
"Do you want to go out?"
"I will have them."
"Good for you."
"Can you?"
"You guys are awesome."
"We will find them."
"I'm thinking about it."
"I'm trying again."
"Don't come."
"How will you do it?"
"Let him finish."
"Let's give it a try."
"And look at yourself."
"Which one do you prefer?"
"We have to go in."
"So, let it go."
"We will be."
"You will be."
"And now this."
"I say yes."
"On the ground."
"How many more?"
"Do you want to try again?"
"Maybe what?"
"I had to act."
"Mom and Dad."
"Hello, friends."
"Search the house."
"In my bed."
"After lunch."
"After all that?"
"Room service."
"I was against it."
"Do you want to go up?"
"He has everything."
"It's rigged."
"Are you forgetting anything?"
"A better idea?"
"She wants a divorce."
"Did you know them?"
"The baby is sleeping."
"It was Dad."
"Do you want to go down?"
"You can dream."
"And since when?"
"Sorry, darling."
"My stepfather."
"He asks you."
"Very well, doctor."
"It was hot."
"Can we go up?"
"You guessed it."
"You guessed it."
"Here's my plan."
"No coffee."
"Take a shower."
"What do they know?"
"But why now?"
"Don't try."
"Go hide."
"Goodbye, honey."
"I hire you."
"Powder."
"Where is Victor?"
"Do what is necessary."
"This is Katie."
"What are you preparing?"
"Look at this one."
"Where is Tyler?"
"Who employs you?"
"It's exquisite."
"I am amazed."
"How many months?"
"Say goodbye."
"Where would I go?"
"I take it back."
"We're keeping it."
"We're keeping it."
"Really, it's okay."
"She passed."
"You dreamed."
"Are you a doctor?"
"He had been drinking."
"He is diabetic."
"I'm going to finish."
"Found something?"
"It was better."
"I had some."
"It is true."
"No drugs."
"The bell rang."
"Is this normal?"
"At college."
"Do the same."
"Do the same."
"Keep your fingers crossed."
"Keep your fingers crossed."
"Oh, sweet Jesus."
"She loved it."
"Open your mouth."
"You can try."
"At the end."
"How much more?"
"It was intentional."
"Come here, little one."
"I was married."
"Do you want to go home?"
"You will understand."
"Are you correct?"
"Point blank."
"Are you sleeping here?"
"It's done."
"Something important."
"Are you in love?"
"Are you a police officer?"
"He's doing it again."
"We have to wait."
"And this morning?"
"Left or right?"
"Lucky break."
"Are you staying for dinner?"
"Are you staying for dinner?"
"He is careful."
"You didn't know?"
"Even for me."
"Why not her?"
"It's proven."
"What are they?"
"Come on, say it."
"Now go ahead."
"Come, come, come."
"He lives here."
"God protect you."
"Me too, Mom."
"Do you know how?"
"Where would you go?"
"He likes it."
"One for me."
"I assured."
"Thanks, I know."
"Go left."
"Thank you for the compliment."
"Are you serious?"
"It was quick."
"Look at this guy."
"Do you understand it?"
"He was magnificent."
"Very good, Mom."
"There are four of them."
"Happy for you."
"How are we doing?"
"We see it."
"And say what?"
"Look at this one."
"She is taken."
"You're adorable."
"It's a matter of time."
"Take off your shoes."
"No, you think so?"
"For two years."
"Romeo and Juliet."
"An old habit."
"Have you checked?"
"Rightly so."
"On your left."
"When will you come back?"
"Hold your breath."
"Hold your breath."
"Is he?"
"No, excuse me."
"Not for her."
"You left."
"Give it to him."
"Good luck, son."
"You will live."
"For several reasons."
"Are you married?"
"I'm still hesitating."
"In the same place."
"That's generous."
"They are smart."
"They are smart."
"Take off your hat."
"How many rooms?"
"My ex-husband."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Morphine."
"In which branch?"
"What's new?"
"Others will come."
"Catch your breath."
"Nobody knows."
"Where is Lana?"
"And him, then?"
"Oh really?"
"Let me in."
"Vote for me."
"How dare they?"
"But that's enough."
"I screamed."
"It is solid."
"Where were they?"
"Here we go."
"I appreciate that."
"Think about what?"
"Do you want to eat?"
"Empty your bag."
"Battle stations."
"I want to eat."
"I will follow you."
"Good evening, guys."
"Count on it."
"Come to me."
"I'm going to sing."
"Look at the time."
"A lucky charm."
"And sex?"
"She doesn't want to."
"Can we move forward?"
"In your dreams."
"Will I see you again?"
"Can you come?"
"He accepted."
"Hello, my pretty."
"How can I explain it to you?"
"He speaks English."
"She was cute."
"I am confident."
"It will be you."
"At the bank."
"We start tomorrow."
"A little coffee?"
"Hello, my love."
"The big day."
"Literally."
"He is unique."
"At any time."
"They know me."
"What did you think?"
"He was happy."
"Each of them."
"Now we wait."
"It seems logical."
"Try it anyway."
"Would that be possible?"
"Tell you what?"
"I'm looking for her."
"Every minute counts."
"I'll wait for him."
"You are human."
"Like a family."
"I'll be home early."
"This is Don."
"I'm warning him."
"What is this?"
"What a lovely surprise."
"OK thanks."
"Open sesame."
"For a moment."
"Look at her carefully."
"Goodbye, Professor."
"It was huge."
"And I appreciate it."
"It was obvious."
"What do you choose?"
"I will investigate."
"Drink your coffee."
"Take off your mask."
"Who are you looking for?"
"You work late."
"Taste this."
"It's high."
"You are radiant."
"Is he coming here?"
"Anyway."
"Show it to me."
"So listen to me."
"So listen to me."
"In time."
"Hey, wake up."
"You are wonderful."
"One for you."
"It is open."
"Not a cat."
"She is clean."
"Not with you."
"He stopped."
"Go faster."
"Let it out."
"They called?"
"You would be surprised."
"It's unintentional."
"She was terrified."
"What are you making?"
"I can't hold on anymore."
"Does that come back to you?"
"Very well said."
"It pays well."
"What can I tell you?"
"Cocaine."
"Watch your back."
"In some ways."
"Listen a little."
"What does she know?"
"Welcome to Earth."
"He's cool."
"He was fine."
"No witness."
"You understand, right?"
"Tell me how."
"I am a model."
"I would do it again."
"Make him talk."
"Starting tomorrow morning."
"I picked up."
"From there."
"Who is right?"
"Yeah, it works."
"Thank you, Grandma."
"Good idea, right?"
"I'm going back to work."
"Compared to what?"
"Under the table."
"For my son."
"Yes, right here."
"It was clear."
"Are you defending him?"
"Turn on the light."
"But you, yes."
"Good friends."
"At the beach."
"We'll go tomorrow."
"Now it's your turn."
"A safe place."
"Poetry."
"She's going to leave."
"And the little one?"
"You could have."
"How do we get in?"
"He has to pay."
"In the dark."
"You're taken."
"On the terrace."
"I am a waitress."
"Is it good?"
"Phone for you."
"Come on, darling."
"It's legitimate."
"No, left."
"No, but thank you."
"Are you in?"
"Are you in?"
"Let me breathe."
"Are you an actress?"
"Sure, man."
"Sorry, girls."
"This is my mother."
"Where does it lead?"
"She loved him."
"Just a friend."
"Can I watch?"
"Do you hear each other?"
"Not without you."
"Are you still asleep?"
"I relax."
"At dawn."
"Use your head."
"Who is calling me?"
"Put that there."
"We were happy."
"What did you expect?"
"They are looking for me."
"Ready to go?"
"I'm taking care of it."
"Or what?"
"Tea, thank you."
"What are they waiting for?"
"What are they waiting for?"
"I'm Chuck."
"Call security."
"Or what else?"
"You are brave."
"Next year."
"Oh, go ahead."
"She looks like me."
"To both of you."
"I like everything."
"I want to change."
"And by far."
"Did you know that?"
"We heard."
"No women."
"Hey, old man."
"The American Dream."
"Where is Doug?"
"I'm shutting up."
"That very one."
"She's telling the truth."
"This is James."
"To my mother."
"Oh, good."
"Not a lot."
"This is my daughter."
"When does it start?"
"We can share."
"Oh, good, good."
"He is untouchable."
"Take the helm."
"Her boyfriend."
"Take one."
"With pleasure, thank you."
"And it starts again."
"You're nice."
"This is crucial."
"This is crucial."
"He ignores it."
"Did you feel it?"
"This is Dan."
"Any other ideas?"
"Two by two."
"I like to dance."
"It was unintentional."
"We know what?"
"You are fast."
"Well done, son."
"Come to your senses."
"Let's go, gentlemen."
"And there?"
"Twenty-one."
"Where is Nathan?"
"Orange juice?"
"End of quote."
"No, just like that."
"To both of us."
"Left, right, left."
"I'm replacing her."
"Always the same."
"For my mother."
"You survived."
"Just one more second."
"What do you prefer?"
"Sorry, man."
"No further."
"Send it to me."
"So, does it work?"
"They have everything."
"I wanted to."
"Okay, sure."
"I am French."
"I want to call."
"Have you seen?"
"Just the two of you?"
"And the match?"
"You are fast."
"What do you like?"
"And what's next?"
"What did it say?"
"No surprise."
"Don't wait."
"A small accident."
"Have you thought about it?"
"Are you coming too?"
"Yes, very beautiful."
"Yes, maybe."
"On what basis?"
"Do you want it?"
"His girlfriend."
"I know how to listen."
"We welcome you."
"What would you say?"
"Have you decided?"
"Where is Julie?"
"I defend myself."
"Do you recognize him?"
"It's ingenious."
"You're on your own."
"Not since yesterday."
"Do you understand now?"
"Glad for you."
"Let us work."
"Another drink?"
"It will be fun."
"Good times."
"I'm going to tidy up."
"Tell me about it."
"Tell me about it."
"Can you answer?"
"I was out."
"Come on, open it."
"Yes, very good."
"And the phone?"
"Are you a pilot?"
"And to me."
"Pack your suitcase."
"Go ahead, darling."
"Let me work."
"For the home."
"I'm keeping this."
"How do you want?"
"Yes, later."
"I am reasonable."
"For a few days."
"More than good."
"Ah, here they are."
"And your daughter?"
"You're mixing everything up."
"Are you high?"
"The sun is shining."
"Hope."
"How much was it?"
"Are you new?"
"Could it be possible?"
"Close the doors."
"Oh, my love."
"It's Wednesday."
"Good God, no."
"Tell them."
"No one important."
"Hey, wait a minute."
"And your car?"
"And last night?"
"We'll see later."
"It was intentional."
"Just five minutes."
"And our market?"
"And three."
"No tears."
"Or something."
"No, not always."
"I was high."
"I am Flash."
"They were here."
"You can check."
"Sauce?"
"Oil."
"Don't listen to them."
"Where is Amy?"
"I am American."
"Take a picture."
"I am an accountant."
"Now let's go."
"They are huge."
"And his name?"
"She goes there."
"And this man?"
"All the same."
"Do you really believe that?"
"Check this out."
"You have started."
"You started."
"Yes, my admiral."
"It's psychological."
"They don't know."
"Let's start with you."
"The time is approaching."
"Take a left."
"I respect you."
"I know where."
"I'm just arriving."
"Try to sleep."
"With time."
"She adores you."
"And the food?"
"Is this allowed?"
"Let's take stock."
"Might as well make the most of it."
"It's personal."
"Will you be there?"
"Say your name."
"I'll manage."
"We must move forward."
"Where is Beth?"
"Hello, my friend."
"They will find us."
"Mom was right."
"I'll improvise."
"I am Lily."
"Very well done."
"It's defensible."
"It was borderline."
"Is it edible?"
"So, what now?"
"Keep moving forward."
"She is mute."
"Do you want to listen?"
"Eyes closed."
"It depresses me."
"Lower your hand."
"More money."
"Do you want to chat?"
"Better not."
"Let's do it now."
"I would like to try."
"I'll explain to him."
"Raise your hand."
"Have you had lunch?"
"Tell the truth."
"Here, read this."
"Hey, look at this."
"Will you wait for me?"
"It's free."
"He likes you."
"Pass them to me."
"Pass them to me."
"Yes, for you."
"Are you leaving us?"
"My little sister."
"On the hill."
"Yes, my queen."
"No alliance."
"I am tall."
"I am tall."
"We'll think about it."
"Are you sure?"
"Under my nose."
"Your favorite dish."
"More than me."
"Take off your clothes."
"My dear friend."
"We are partners."
"We are partners."
"Just to see."
"Come, follow me."
"Wait for my call."
"No, my dear."
"She is a journalist."
"You messed up."
"You messed up."
"You could try."
"I'm going to move."
"I'll fuck you."
"Dad was right."
"Where will you be?"
"Go ahead, drink."
"Hello, my friends."
"You were beautiful."
"Do you remember?"
"It's normal."
"They are everywhere."
"We hear you."
"Is he working?"
"Be good."
"You see there?"
"That one too."
"Think about yourself."
"You are rich."
"You will know."
"Request for reinforcements."
"Yes, much better."
"Take notes."
"Here, my friend."
"Just for you."
"They are pretty."
"It's light."
"Do you know how to swim?"
"I'm still looking."
"Good night, Benjamin."
"Oh, well."
"And goodbye."
"What date?"
"He looks like him."
"Do you come often?"
"And from whom?"
"How to find it?"
"It's close."
"Let her come in."
"You're handsome."
"He looks at me."
"This is Sally."
"What are you wearing?"
"Send someone."
"Do you want to live?"
"Get yourself treated."
"It's cool."
"Do you care?"
"It's new."
"Look, guys."
"I knew."
"You've changed."
"There, it's fine."
"Is it legal?"
"He will pay."
"Go for a walk."
"Day after day."
"For your birthday."
"I'll bring it."
"Bring it up."
"How much do you have?"
"The whole world."
"He was looking at me."
"Your Royal Highness."
"It belongs to me."
"Are you going to sing?"
"Since I was little."
"You understand quickly."
"Let her breathe."
"He remembers."
"We have to go back."
"I understand, yes."
"I have you."
"To what end?"
"He is mute."
"What are you taking?"
"I don't understand."
"Accidents happen."
"I'm looking for you."
"Sounds interesting."
"I'm going to close."
"We will see about that."
"I prefer to wait."
"They are busy."
"Where is Buffy?"
"Just across the street."
"About a week."
"Pull down your pants."
"They are strong."
"This is the reason."
"Where would you go?"
"You wait here."
"Where is Molly?"
"You have me."
"For a girl."
"You stay there."
"Santa Claus."
"Especially at night."
"Easy, big guy."
"Take a vacation."
"She is sublime."
"Have you eaten?"
"Hi, how are you?"
"I feel it."
"Like your father."
"I'll take note."
"We were arguing."
"Of all that."
"A little late."
"You are awesome."
"Look at the map."
"I drank."
"Where is Mary?"
"He calls me."
"How to explain it?"
"I am a reporter."
"I hesitated."
"Bring it to me."
"You're heavy."
"I'm straight."
"Make an appointment."
"I will call them."
"We've got you."
"This is Helen."
"Where is Lily?"
"You are perceptive."
"What would you do?"
"They love me."
"You know, you?"
"So, let's get to work."
"You are fantastic."
"To life."
"Good evening, my dear."
"The train is arriving."
"They started."
"She does it."
"To new friends."
"Here is my plan."
"How to prove it?"
"And be careful."
"It is important."
"Turn down the volume."
"Well done everyone."
"My grandson."
"Go ahead, send it."
"It's solid."
"Stay in touch."
"One last chance."
"Ah, you see?"
"Are you happy?"
"Mr. Minister."
"She will be delighted."
"He was cute."
"Raise your head."
"Watch over him."
"I will say it."
"In this outfit?"
"Family reunion."
"The meter is running."
"I want to drive."
"She was fine."
"Do you see this?"
"I was a volunteer."
"What year?"
"That makes four."
"Are you talking to him?"
"You should eat."
"No, my heart."
"Dad is gone."
"Who's getting married?"
"For a while."
"We will share."
"Very good, great."
"Behind the door."
"Go ahead then."
"Another thing."
"I protect her."
"She is hiding."
"I am Sofia."
"I'll bring him back."
"Go shopping."
"I'm nice."
"Yes, see you soon."
"Big day tomorrow."
"Hold the position."
"Change the subject."
"Thank you, see you soon."
"So, how was your day?"
"Yes, received."
"Hello, my boy."
"Go back there."
"Let her come."
"Are you finished?"
"Who pays you?"
"In life."
"Too much work."
"It's fun."
"I have to see."
"In the kitchen."
"Here is the number."
"You were fine."
"He is Italian."
"Keep searching."
"And tomorrow night?"
"When?"
"Bring her in."
"See you tomorrow evening."
"Hold the steering wheel."
"Yes, both."
"You and you."
"Do you know how to cook?"
"Sorry, darling."
"How can I explain this?"
"Little things."
"To the west."
"I vote for."
"All these years."
"At your command."
"Do you know any?"
"Nobody comes."
"Where is it going?"
"Where is Rose?"
"And the third?"
"What are you preparing?"
"Dad is fine."
"It's free."
"I'm holding them back."
"And where to go?"
"What's he doing?"
"Sure and certain."
"I'll take them."
"Come join us."
"You're cool."
"You are punished."
"Hold your positions."
"I will be brief."
"In the past."
"Take my arm."
"White wine."
"I'm going ahead."
"Closing the doors."
"Take responsibility."
"Where is Chuck?"
"He protected me."
"Your Honor."
"I had to try."
"Hello my brother."
"Where is Megan?"
"What will change?"
"Where was I?"
"Unlike me."
"Are you up for it?"
"Are you up for it?"
"Yes, good night."
"What do you mean, what?"
"Guys, look."
"Are you doing it again?"
"I was looking for her."
"A good friend."
"Something is happening."
"Okay baby."
"She is getting ready."
"Including you."
"Including you."
"I'm done for."
"It's worth celebrating."
"You can go up."
"They call me."
"With my mother."
"Are you helping us?"
"This is Karen."
"And for that?"
"I'm going."
"Yes, thank God."
"Identity card?"
"She is clean."
"Where is Elizabeth?"
"That's smart."
"Raise the shields."
"Answer the phone."
"Can I try?"
"No correspondence."
"Where is Abby?"
"On TV."
"It looks good."
"It looks good."
"It looks good."
"Can I read?"
"In this weather?"
"It looks great."
"You came."
"Do you want to stay?"
"You have to get out."
"Can we watch?"
"Can I listen?"
"I know how to count."
"Dry your tears."
"Very well, Captain."
"Where do they live?"
"Everything is written."
"Hello, you two."
"In this neighborhood?"
"I will write to you."
"Do I look like him?"
"Have you decided?"
"Yeah, right there."
"Well, yeah."
"Where is Quinn?"
"They were waiting for us."
"Yes, we will see."
"She's still breathing."
"They love it."
"How are you, sir?"
"In my dreams."
"Wait a little."
"Do you see it?"
"Who knows why."
"Hello, my dear."
"Towards the west."
"But yes, let's see."
"You would like to."
"Who wants what?"
"Wait for the rest."
"We are friends."
"I improvised."
"With a girl."
"Where is Jesse?"
"God is good."
"Yes, basically."
"She is a nurse."
"And over there?"
"Where is Karen?"
"Clean this up for me."
"It's sensational."
"Bend your knees."
"Nothing specific."
"In your seats."
"In the library."
"He apologizes."
"We are surrounded."
"Are you eating well?"
"One or two."
"No thank you, sir."
"Where is Carol?"
"Where is Nina?"
"You are magnificent."
"He asks you."
"I was looking for him."
"Catch your breath."
"At friends' house."
"Now, get to work."
"Well done, my boy."
"That seems reasonable."
"It's there."
"There and there."
"You have to deal with it."
"Take the keys."
"A young woman."
"I serve you."
"We are close."
"Let's go, honey."
"You should stay."
"Does mom know?"
"Walk a little."
"Just that one."
"Does that bother you?"
"Play something."
"Where were they going?"
"Not a chance."
"Go to the bathroom."
"From all over the world."
"You survived."
"Can you open?"
"It will come back."
"Block the exits."
"We will leave tomorrow."
"It's cozy."
"Take the baby."
"This is Robin."
"I am disarmed."
"For a very long time."
"She's in it."
"A human being."
"I am lucky."
"I'm not saying anything."
"Are you a nurse?"
"I am a firefighter."
"We're coming from there."
"Shall we talk about it?"
"Yes, twice."
"Let me summarize."
"Be sure of it."
"I would tell him."
"Let's take a look."
"The first day."
"From the part?"
"Be yourself."
"Pick up the phone."
"Tell us what?"
"I work late."
"These are the facts."
"You have to back off."
"It got out of hand."
"At a friend's house."
"I'm working tomorrow."
"When are you coming back?"
"Here is the list."
"We are working on it."
"Where is Stefan?"
"It's better."
"We will know."
"We can win."
"I'm stressed."
"This is Kyle."
"Gather your things."
"She is getting married."
"Car theft."
"Your favorite color?"
"This is Bobby."
"You are charming."
"You are charming."
"Last summer."
"Yes, one day."
"Towards the east."
"Here are the facts."
"Hello, police?"
"It's precious."
"It was here."
"Keep them closed."
"Do you want to?"
"We'll talk tomorrow."
"I could try."
"Are you a believer?"
"Not the other way around."
"Well, good."
"Cream?"
"This is Jeff."
"For my wife."
"For hours."
"Tell us everything."
"Don't swear."
"Nothing surprising."
"Get on top of it."
"Give it a try."
"I know how to drive."
"I am clean."
"Hey, over here."
"Where does she live?"
"Another coffee?"
"We believe it."
"Come join me."
"Mr. and Mrs."
"Can you wait?"
"You're finished."
"I am absent."
"Make me laugh."
"They are stuck."
"For you too."
"Fill out this form."
"Listen to your mother."
"Come back to earth."
"It's stable."
"Show me what?"
"Go join them."
"Will you tell him?"
"Turn your head."
"Do you know how to play?"
"Pray for me."
"Not those."
"Yes, I knew."
"I wanted to leave."
"Who are you calling?"
"You can go."
"What to do then?"
"Go your own way."
"About a month."
"Okay, I understand."
"It's moving."
"On what occasion?"
"Watch out, guys."
"Oh, forgive me."
"All right, honey."
"Go all out."
"When is it?"
"I am sexy."
"They are friends."
"She is nowhere to be found."
"Tell me that again."
"Wait, listen to me."
"Let me listen."
"Look at these pictures."
"I'm approaching."
"On the head."
"Give it back to him."
"Do you know what?"
"I park."
"God bless him."
"You swear?"
"Two out of three."
"What about my car?"
"She is a minor."
"I'll come back tomorrow."
"What am I looking at?"
"Are you engaged?"
"Where is Sophie?"
"I would like to."
"I would like it."
"I like to cook."
"For all of you."
"I am human."
"About two hours."
"It's sweet."
"Let's keep moving forward."
"Always late."
"Do you work here?"
"Everything is connected."
"Drum roll."
"I started."
"It's anonymous."
"It's back."
"My dear boy."
"I'm interested."
"Yes, we should."
"Do you have anything better?"
"Let's have a coffee."
"In nature."
"Do you want to visit?"
"Have you been drinking?"
"It's unique."
"My little darling."
"Let it go."
"He's going to call."
"Not ours."
"And you, Dad?"
"From Los Angeles."
"This guy."
"But he does."
"In the barn."
"Under what circumstances?"
"That day."
"For a week."
"For a week."
"Stay put."
"I have to eat."
"You were awesome."
"He disappeared."
"Good luck, kid."
"No, you stay."
"Wedding gift."
"I am focused."
"Safe and sound."
"Well done, kid."
"A real tough guy."
"I am a psychologist."
"Find something."
"Find something."
"Where is Ann?"
"Where is Angel?"
"Am I disturbing you?"
"I'll come by tomorrow."
"No beer."
"In the jungle."
"I'll tell you."
"You were."
"It will be perfect."
"I spoke."
"Will you be there?"
"How can I believe you?"
"Who is behind?"
"How much do you have?"
"How much do you have?"
"How much do you have?"
"How much do you have?"
"I can start again."
"I'm Ben."
"At the very back."
"Phone for you."
"I am moved."
"What did you think?"
"Mr. Director."
"Yes, uncle."
"Choose one."
"Do you like me?"
"Tell him everything."
"Just you."
"That will have to wait."
"Very close."
"I am handsome."
"About two weeks."
"It surprises me."
"Try to understand."
"She was hot."
"I will keep my word."
"Do you want some?"
"Am I pretty?"
"Or the other way around."
"You will be fine."
"Ready, guys?"
"Right in the head."
"Can we know?"
"When are you leaving again?"
"In my own way."
"You should go out."
"You should go out."
"Oh, I forgot."
"Here, go ahead."
"He is brave."
"Here you go, guys."
"Of course, baby."
"But I know."
"I wasn't sleeping."
"He always comes back."
"Are you leaving us?"
"We will be together."
"Except one thing."
"Do you live here?"
"He looks at you."
"How many are there?"
"And the boat?"
"You are engaged."
"Far from you."
"Can we taste?"
"Don't hang around."
"That would be fun."
"Do you trust?"
"But no, Mom."
"I'm leaving too."
"And by whom?"
"Sounds like fun."
"Welcome to Hollywood."
"It's authentic."
"Let them do it."
"He should have."
"Everything is cool."
"They work together."
"Here is the file."
"Where is Vic?"
"He must."
"Would you do it?"
"The party begins."
"Except once."
"Just a moment longer."
"Like magic."
"You are you."
"We are colleagues."
"No, not me."
"Did she speak?"
"She jumped."
"That's clever."
"What do you say?"
"Are you going to accept?"
"Ten percent."
"It was closed."
"Ready for takeoff."
"He is a doctor."
"Hey, kids."
"It's intimate."
"This is ideal."
"They accepted."
"Tell me where."
"A lot of work."
"Who are you calling?"
"Just one."
"Wait for me outside."
"Near here?"
"Did you know him?"
"A huge thing."
"A breakfast?"
"Where do you live?"
"Do you want it?"
"Go find her."
"Smell this."
"You are surrounded."
"More of what?"
"When do you finish?"
"Where was he going?"
"I like to read."
"I understand myself."
"Not by choice."
"Can we eat?"
"Confidence reigns."
"We're going to close."
"She understands me."
"Clear the area."
"The one in the middle."
"Are you a student?"
"Goodbye, Will."
"Happy birthday, Dad."
"You'll like it."
"Choose a card."
"Come, follow me."
"You hesitated."
"His best friend."
"It is imperative."
"Better than me."
"Absolutely beautiful."
"You should too."
"I enjoyed it."
"How did you know?"
"I am a student."
"I am a student."
"I am English."
"I am a teacher."
"Sorry, what were you saying?"
"Hold your positions."
"Can I participate?"
"Yes, my child."
"Walk with me."
"Let's talk about this."
"She must know."
"About six months."
"Not in public."
"Good day, madam."
"How can I believe you?"
"You have to choose."
"He's looking for it."
"We do it."
"It is."
"Okay, calm down."
"And the kid?"
"Look at all this."
"Not even you."
"And the second?"
"It's all in there."
"Is it allowed?"
"Can I have it?"
"I am interested."
"I love him."
"Only three more."
"I was fine."
"Do you want it?"
"For the most part."
"And my friends?"
"Can I answer?"
"Thank you, Grandpa."
"Like this one."
"They are close."
"Here's our guy."
"Just one question."
"You're good."
"He is powerful."
"Who came?"
"This is Howard."
"What, darling?"
"I believed it."
"Can you wait?"
"Goodbye, Captain."
"Hey, come here."
"No need to continue."
"We'll watch."
"Where is Angela?"
"Take off your coat."
"Show them to me."
"You can go down."
"He has them."
"What are we watching?"
"A true hero."
"Hey, big guy."
"Not even me."
"So, the job?"
"I'll let you know."
"All right."
"On my life."
"I'll pass."
"You could come."
"Here's your man."
"Say your prayers."
"Are you giving up?"
"New Orleans."
"I can work."
"And the fingerprints?"
"I swear."
"Show must go on."
"You wanted to know."
"Wait for instructions."
"They were close."
"Is that your business?"
"You are mean."
"But why?"
"Here's yours."
"Go ahead then."
"Yes, himself."
"Keep watching."
"Keep watching."
"Keep watching."
"We are calm."
"Hello, Grandpa."
"He went down."
"Keep your promise."
"For my brother."
"And the doctor?"
"Every second counts."
"What a nice place."
"Have faith."
"But better."
"Your girlfriend?"
"It belongs to you."
"Do your homework."
"We have to go down."
"You will stay here."
"Here are the rules."
"She is single."
"He's cute."
"To apologize."
"Entry code."
"Yes, this way."
"Let's start from the beginning."
"Prove it to me."
"Yesterday afternoon."
"But by whom?"
"As little as possible."
"I know what?"
"We'll get there."
"Just one thing."
"Get that out of my way."
"What do you sell?"
"Well, good evening."
"Honeymoon?"
"Shall I tell you?"
"Don't push it."
"They are brothers."
"Let's keep looking."
"You're hot."
"A little souvenir."
"Yes, my boy."
"Will you do it?"
"Give me some."
"Hello to you."
"And your friends?"
"Okay, girls."
"Of course, doctor."
"Go back to bed."
"They are wonderful."
"I am expected."
"I'm going out tomorrow."
"Did you stop?"
"He will speak."
"Send it to me."
"What do you suggest?"
"Yes, several times."
"This is Allison."
"Thank you, my sister."
"Thank you, sister."
"Eternal life."
"One on one."
"Do you have any?"
"They are having fun."
"Can't you hear?"
"For a month."
"He is splendid."
"Comfortable?"
"It is necessary."
"No exceptions."
"It amuses me."
"This is Angela."
"Hey, little guy."
"I will be careful."
"Do you speak German?"
"In the bathtub."
"Oh, you know."
"ID?"
"Excuse me, Captain."
"Shut your mouth."
"Not in our house."
"In the future."
"I have traveled."
"Keep the pressure on."
"Wherever you want."
"I'll tell you."
"Did he eat?"
"For your own good."
"He was gifted."
"Good heavens, no."
"He will call you back."
"My brother-in-law."
"You are different."
"I liked it."
"I talk to him."
"They are fast."
"It's been a long time."
"Do you think so?"
"Lots of people."
"She confessed."
"It's behind."
"You're a good kisser."
"I dreamed about it."
"Good morning, Mr. Draper."
"You are fabulous."
"Are you taking it?"
"Come on, move over."
"You asked."
"Where is Jeff?"
"I had to ask."
"Can we come by?"
"He will have it."
"You came."
"Who is in it?"
"Can it be cured?"
"Go ahead, talk."
"Let's be clear."
"Come closer."
"This is Chuck."
"Put it here."
"It looks like you."
"Shall we go back?"
"From very far away."
"Think for a second."
"Take this too."
"Tell me how."
"Almost two years."
"Look behind you."
"To see what?"
"No map."
"Is it me?"
"Keep talking."
"You'll never guess."
"And much more."
"No work."
"He loved it."
"He loved it."
"Every night."
"Let him come."
"More than enough."
"You will find it good."
"Change the channel."
"He's high."
"Who rang?"
"You play well."
"Not this morning."
"I'm still looking."
"It's getting complicated."
"Only one more."
"What you say."
"It was free."
"That would be fantastic."
"You shut up."
"So, see you soon."
"In the front row."
"Are you in a hurry?"
"Do you want to start?"
"Your time will come."
"Let them wait."
"He's choking."
"No mail."
"All four of them."
"Open the window."
"Let him breathe."
"I had to know."
"Come say hello."
"Take your bag."
"This is Doug."
"This is essential."
"She is solid."
"What would you like?"
"Which one are you?"
"It's premature."
"Obviously not."
"It's gone."
"He was a doctor."
"Ask him what?"
"Galactica, this is Apollo."
"Take the money."
"Yet another one."
"Yet another one."
"What are you listening to?"
"What are you listening to?"
"I would be."
"Yes, I accept."
"You are unique."
"Like a dog."
"She knows me."
"Many others."
"Is this reasonable?"
"She is engaged."
"I'm covered."
"Do you speak Spanish?"
"Take your jacket."
"It will be fine here."
"And the war?"
"Go get some."
"Put two of them."
"Yes, let's do that."
"Are you up for it?"
"It looks like it."
"Trust you?"
"Especially for you."
"No, I love it."
"In this direction."
"Want to watch?"
"To friendship."
"Another man?"
"He is Jewish."
"They ran away."
"Don't drink."
"Use it."
"I am beautiful."
"I'll make a note of it."
"At your ease."
"I am a teacher."
"Close this door."
"Well, I think."
"Where is Monica?"
"That seems fair."
"In the morning."
"At university."
"What would it be?"
"They are fantastic."
"In the van."
"Let me go, man."
"Everything is fine."
"I am a painter."
"No, of course not."
"She was great."
"This is Charlotte."
"Of life."
"Whose?"
"And his daughter?"
"Where do you work?"
"Where do you work?"
"Are you coming with us?"
"Go in peace."
"You are a lawyer."
"As it should be."
"Will you call me back?"
"Return to camp."
"Take a bath."
"They are closed."
"Lower your voice."
"I was saying to myself."
"Do you work together?"
"Who is here?"
"Or a woman."
"We must leave."
"Bring it down."
"I would say yes."
"Thank you, my child."
"This is Abby."
"What's left?"
"We are in love."
"We came back."
"Keep the faith."
"Take the day off."
"Right in front of me."
"Don't bother."
"Did you notice?"
"Pray with me."
"Do you want to give up?"
"You are awake."
"They are cool."
"Are you finished?"
"That suits us."
"She came in."
"On the train."
"From the beginning."
"This is Victor."
"Lock the doors."
"The whole story."
"Goodbye, Jim."
"They are adorable."
"Take your seats."
"You seem surprised."
"Popcorn?"
"This way."
"Shall we see each other?"
"Where were you going?"
"We are free."
"This is Liz."
"Are you touched?"
"One will be enough."
"Are you affected?"
"Believe in yourself."
"Notify the police."
"We know her."
"Are you coming tomorrow?"
"I'm hot."
"I will prove it."
"Jump with me."
"I'll be right there."
"Let her sleep."
"No more time."
"You must know."
"To love."
"This is Amanda."
"Do you like to dance?"
"He knows you."
"He knows you."
"But from whom?"
"And one."
"Just to say."
"Sorry, darling."
"You will be perfect."
"Tell me about it."
"Why do you ask?"
"It's flooded."
"OK, I see."
"Just a beer."
"Are you out?"
"Good night, Father."
"Like brothers."
"Look at the camera."
"Who does what?"
"What a beautiful evening."
"Are you telling me?"
"I am a witness."
"She is cold."
"I obeyed."
"Come on a little."
"He must be sleeping."
"Keep breathing."
"You will win."
"Go ahead, go back."
"No evidence."
"From the earth."
"We'll take you."
"Save your saliva."
"To protect us."
"It's cut."
"You'll get there."
"You too, right?"
"Say his name."
"This is Sara."
"He sees everything."
"Take a deep breath."
"It's regular."
"Can I leave?"
"Where is Nate?"
"I accept them."
"And your arm?"
"Call a taxi."
"Okay, buddy."
"Is he on drugs?"
"How are they doing?"
"We'll come back."
"Look at the sky."
"He is modest."
"Not for sale."
"Can I know?"
"In the United States."
"I was looking at you."
"They are free."
"He is protected."
"Is anyone there?"
"But why him?"
"You were superb."
"At my parents' house."
"I admire that."
"They are here."
"But from where?"
"No, excuse me."
"Keep me company."
"Are you happy?"
"Are you happy?"
"Here's the rub."
"Look at the time."
"Take command."
"You're stuck."
"Are you doing this?"
"He will be delighted."
"It was fascinating."
"And all that."
"He is cunning."
"Smile a little."
"In a hospital."
"He travels a lot."
"Who will be there?"
"I'm toast."
"That would explain everything."
"No hospital."
"What does it represent?"
"Don't you get it?"
"What was I saying?"
"Are you Jewish?"
"He was strong."
"Here, my darling."
"I investigated."
"In between."
"I am real."
"They always come back."
"A lot of time."
"You go ahead."
"This is Sophie."
"But go ahead."
"Do you like it?"
"That's enough for me."
"Do you know her?"
"Close the window."
"Your grandfather?"
"He will pass."
"But guess what?"
"Two and a half."
"I prefer to stay."
"Drink something."
"Let me in."
"I understand, really."
"He could have."
"What are you eating?"
"Spare me that."
"We checked."
"As I was saying."
"She tried."
"It won't happen."
"And another one."
"Does this happen often?"
"I dreamed."
"And this girl?"
"The weather is good."
"An email?"
"I am divorced."
"Yeah, like that."
"It's ambitious."
"It's in there."
"On the coast."
"We understand each other."
"More water."
"And at your place?"
"Welcome back."
"We are rich."
"New Jersey?"
"Spread the word."
"It was normal."
"I had a flat tire."
"I was there."
"And your evening?"
"Guys, listen."
"What did they want?"
"How's it going, man?"
"In the shed."
"To the infirmary."
"They will be fine."
"Let's make a deal."
"Let's make a deal."
"Everything is locked."
"It's subtle."
"A black coffee."
"Well, go ahead."
"You are amazing."
"And I will come back."
"How dare you?"
"Are you coming to eat?"
"I commit."
"To the car."
"Right, Mom?"
"Why this stop?"
"Retired."
"Look up."
"What does it contain?"
"What were you looking for?"
"Just one hour."
"Look elsewhere."
"Be more specific."
"I will do everything."
"It is closed."
"One more effort."
"Send the sauce."
"But without me."
"She looks at me."
"What more?"
"We think so."
"Yes, see you later."
"You should know."
"Not this way."
"He was handsome."
"Are you a doctor?"
"Good news."
"I will teach you."
"Do you want to answer?"
"Do you want to try?"
"It's intentional."
"Can he talk?"
"It's on."
"Take the controls."
"Fix this for me."
"Take the car."
"I'll take it."
"It makes you want to."
"A young girl."
"How much of what?"
"To protect her."
"Thank you, Commander."
"Not a trace."
"Who will it be?"
"What does this mean?"
"We see you."
"Why talk about it?"
"I support you."
"She accepted."
"No drugs."
"Who says that?"
"Like a charm."
"Thank you very much, gentlemen."
"He cut."
"She was going to leave."
"Go get ready."
"People are waiting."
"Let's go talk outside."
"A charming man."
"Watch your words."
"You should have."
"I would like to come."
"I was in a hurry."
"I came."
"I wanted to check."
"I like to win."
"The good life."
"Who left?"
"Listen to your father."
"They are looking for you."
"With immediate effect."
"Who paid?"
"Bring her here."
"Sing for me."
"And my husband?"
"You've grown old."
"I like to walk."
"Not in there."
"They are identical."
"They are identical."
"Take off your cap."
"Come up with me."
"Goodbye, Father."
"Why do this?"
"What are you looking for?"
"At my command."
"For that, yes."
"Go back."
"Go back."
"He's coming back tomorrow."
"Easy, buddy."
"And the witnesses?"
"Well what?"
"You're not listening."
"Do you have it?"
"They love it."
"Status report."
"Put them there."
"It's direct."
"For an hour."
"To the left."
"Come back and see us."
"I wanted to come."
"Let's take a look."
"You are human."
"Mr. Officer."
"Irrelevant."
"Up to the neck."
"Good luck, Captain."
"She is brave."
"And the apartment?"
"I am unforgivable."
"Hey, man."
"Same for us."
"They are looking for him."
"You're soaked."
"But why here?"
"Place your bets."
"You're fine."
"I have to pick up."
"They are real."
"This is Joey."
"This is Julie."
"Pray for me."
"I'll drive you."
"In San Francisco."
"Are you parents?"
"Where is Wilson?"
"I'm Joel."
"You will be free."
"They love you."
"She kisses you."
"Look at his head."
"This is Justin."
"It's black."
"That would be lovely."
"They are amazing."
"It helps a lot."
"Was it serious?"
"Thanks, guys."
"A good guy."
"Take your chance."
"I came."
"I am good."
"Will you be nice?"
"You promised."
"Come join us."
"Him and me."
"Come to bed."
"Tell me when."
"Tell me when."
"We are listening to you."
"Strength and honor."
"Go back home."
"Go home."
"Do you travel a lot?"
"I was in love."
"Are you shy?"
"Sorry I'm late."
"Are you helping us?"
"It means a lot."
"Hello, my dear."
"Turn up the volume."
"Yes, last night."
"We work here."
"No, we're staying."
"I'm watching them."
"I am sensitive."
"They are in love."
"Do you live there?"
"Can he hear me?"
"Come, my treasure."
"Let us do it."
"Yes, us too."
"I will tell you everything."
"Another bottle."
"You are cool."
"Captain's order."
"Come on, see you later."
"Come back tomorrow morning."
"Not for them."
"Oh, goodness."
"Sorry, brother."
"Except you."
"Since yesterday evening."
"Are you a musician?"
"We are everywhere."
"Let's drink to that."
"Not a cent."
"One more hour."
"Two hundred dollars."
"She was superb."
"No meat."
"I want to, yes."
"This time, yes."
"It's American."
"I start tomorrow."
"And the letter?"
"They tried."
"Does it really exist?"
"Look at this guy."
"Like this one?"
"Oh, my heart."
"Let me introduce you."
"After the wedding."
"We will be together."
"With whom?"
"Where is Carlos?"
"I am a dad."
"It's medical."
"And what about her?"
"Breathe with me."
"Live a little."
"Is it necessary?"
"Do you recognize this?"
"She is extraordinary."
"It's irresistible."
"It's late."
"Good night, Will."
"This is your commander."
"Every year."
"Look at the screen."
"What was he saying?"
"It was strong."
"Where is Aaron?"
"I had everything."
"Don't you think so?"
"Everything is known."
"Ah, so much the better."
"It was fun."
"Wait and see."
"Take a right."
"How many of us are there?"
"In the army."
"And your trip?"
"Please take a seat."
"No rush."
"Around here."
"And yours?"
"We love it."
"Let's take our time."
"Ready to go?"
"A real pleasure."
"Let me explain."
"That kind."
"Don't listen to him."
"This is your room."
"It's pink."
"Nobody wins."
"No footprint."
"Let's go through there."
"What do you prefer?"
"Go out with me."
"Quick, let's go."
"Are you leaving too?"
"She is possessed."
"In the attic."
"Where is Audrey?"
"A dog barks."
"Can I drink?"
"God knows why."
"He disgusts me."
"She is smart."
"Are you blocked?"
"In the countryside."
"Right behind you."
"Before leaving."
"She gets dressed."
"Change your tone."
"I would like that too."
"Good luck, darling."
"The next morning."
"Good evening, children."
"God protect you."
"Tell me that again."
"How was I?"
"You're done for."
"It sounds perfect."
"Where is Harvey?"
"What do you decide?"
"We are Americans."
"I keep my word."
"I'm staying too."
"I think the same."
"It was necessary."
"Yes, my king."
"I am Irish."
"Welcome, my friend."
"Leave the city."
"That makes five."
"Watch me do it."
"This is Morgan."
"Take something."
"Same modus operandi."
"Not here either."
"He was great."
"She loved you."
"Where was I?"
"I started again."
"And the music?"
"Open the gate."
"But listen to me."
"It keeps me busy."
"Good evening to you."
"I'm teasing you."
"How far are we?"
"And in there?"
"Especially women."
"Just a kiss."
"In single file."
"At what level?"
"Tell us everything."
"Thank you for the information."
"He promised."
"The one on the left."
"No closer."
"For both."
"I was helping him."
"Good luck, Dad."
"Okay, whatever."
"Am I right?"
"Stay in bed."
"Yes, I think so."
"Well, there you have it."
"I play more."
"Who can know?"
"It's noble."
"He knew her."
"It is full."
"This is Jesse."
"Let it pass."
"For work."
"And later?"
"So, let's get to work."
"Nothing good."
"What year?"
"Call the police?"
"I'm soaked."
"What are you hiding?"
"Philadelphia Police."
"They are separated."
"You deserve it."
"I'll let you know."
"You were together?"
"Stay on him."
"Where is Mason?"
"It could have."
"He will forgive you."
"You're stuck."
"Everything is ruined."
"Police siren."
"Yes, yes, thank you."
"Keep breathing."
"Pull the trigger."
"He is an architect."
"Put on your seatbelt."
"I am normal."
"It's miraculous."
"From what?"
"Thank you, my good man."
"Right in the middle."
"Can we talk?"
"He was high."
"Are you coming home already?"
"The good news?"
"Welcome."
"I am honored."
"No magic."
"Let him out."
"It's old."
"Same as you."
"You wanted to talk."
"Repeatedly."
"She is tough."
"Drink your tea."
"Read on."
"And your sister?"
"No wallet."
"Do you see it?"
"They passed."
"Did she eat?"
"You are rich."
"A long time ago."
"Yes, all of that."
"He is attractive."
"This is Logan."
"I am satisfied."
"And the plane?"
"You should watch."
"On the bus."
"I was hiding."
"I farted."
"Change of direction."
"Follow my finger."
"Follow my finger."
"Do you believe them?"
"I was pregnant."
"Take his legs."
"In space."
"Good, my boy."
"It looks like me."
"You sing well."
"Take a deep breath."
"Just around the corner."
"I'll take some."
"In three weeks."
"To thank you."
"It will be great."
"What were you waiting for?"
"Look at the picture."
"I was having fun."
"Keep trying."
"Here is his address."
"Thank you for understanding."
"Energy."
"Within the hour."
"It's signed."
"End of course."
"Good night, baby."
"Keep walking."
"We got it."
"When are they arriving?"
"I will write to him."
"Where is Jacob?"
"He's toast."
"Let her pass."
"I'll make everything right."
"No speech."
"Are you busy?"
"I'm going with it."
"You work late."
"Are you married?"
"And the gasoline?"
"I want you."
"Do you want to come by?"
"And the second?"
"Your coffee, sir."
"Phone number?"
"It exploded."
"Hold his head."
"Hold his head."
"You are cute."
"Did you accept?"
"Where is Vince?"
"How big?"
"I am a sleepwalker."
"It will be wonderful."
"That's the work."
"Come on, over to you."
"Security alert."
"You are me."
"I wanted to."
"I would have tried."
"I would have liked."
"We hide."
"For years."
"And the cake?"
"Without fail."
"Put it here."
"Take a cigarette."
"One of each."
"You signed."
"Are you leaving now?"
"Every morning."
"He works there."
"It's physical."
"Oh yes, thank you."
"Put on your helmet."
"It's chic."
"Get out of the car."
"No, from me."
"When is she coming back?"
"In your room."
"I should answer."
"I am grateful."
"I am grateful."
"How many balls?"
"It's coded."
"Did you feel it?"
"The film begins."
"Just a few hours."
"This is the house."
"From the city."
"You are tough."
"They will find you."
"Turn on the radio."
"Where is Bruce?"
"Hello, little brother."
"Play the game."
"Do you trust?"
"Your boyfriend?"
"It will be easy."
"It's out."
"Do you see us?"
"With my wife."
"I'm going ahead."
"The little girl."
"She lives here."
"She lives here."
"Call someone."
"The high class."
"How would you do it?"
"Lemonade?"
"Unlike you."
"Have you watched?"
"We will be."
"More than one."
"No visitors."
"Yes, Grandma."
"From whom, then?"
"And the people?"
"I work a lot."
"Put down that phone."
"Are you in a hurry?"
"I got it."
"Sorry, guys."
"Sorry, guys."
"He knew everything."
"And the neighbors?"
"So, how's it going?"
"Yes, and then what?"
"I look at him."
"Well, there you go."
"He is a minor."
"Stay in touch."
"Here and here."
"Too many memories."
"Go talk to them."
"Oh, look at you."
"Take the bag."
"First class."
"And the kids?"
"They are great."
"Shall we go for a walk?"
"Turn the page."
"To celebrate this."
"Yes, my mother."
"My favorite dish."
"What do I hear?"
"Well, that's fine."
"Let's keep in touch."
"Let's start from the beginning."
"Yes, a few."
"And the truth?"
"Do you want to continue?"
"Cards on the table."
"No, never seen it."
"Come on, get out of here."
"I'll take it back."
"A nice guy."
"I'm calling mom."
"No bullshit."
"How do they know?"
"No, not very."
"So, girls?"
"Go back and sit down."
"No one will know."
"I studied."
"She is black."
"Are you going to open?"
"Hi, how are you?"
"They are old."
"Yes, that's enough."
"Now, excuse me."
"Same time tomorrow?"
"Are you going to answer?"
"My mother-in-law."
"Sorry, sweetie."
"I got divorced."
"They know each other."
"His phone rings."
"In the city center."
"He's OK."
"Up to what?"
"I can win."
"And thank you very much."
"My guardian angel."
"I would love to come."
"This is Gloria."
"One by one."
"Let her in."
"So, this dinner?"
"Hello, Grandpa."
"They are working on it."
"It was divine."
"It should hold."
"Hey, look at me."
"Here is the program."
"I am a priest."
"Where do you work?"
"You are famous."
"Yes, my sister."
"I ask myself."
"Congratulations, by the way."
"A big thank you."
"He's managing."
"At my sister's."
"Look at the date."
"And my work?"
"Are you calling him?"
"Only one person."
"Do you want to win?"
"Do you want to win?"
"They are right."
"A matter of principle."
"Tell him no."
"Let me understand."
"I was waiting for this."
"Here, my dear."
"I'll take you on board."
"Just like him."
"They kiss."
"How does he know?"
"Hello, young people."
"He says that?"
"Choose one."
"Take your positions."
"Take my arm."
"No, tell me."
"You have to keep going."
"Pay attention to it."
"Where are you going?"
"Many deaths."
"Where was she going?"
"Hello, uncle."
"Where is Morgan?"
"Less than you."
"Well done, Dad."
"No food."
"With my son."
"Just out of curiosity."
"With his mother."
"His cell phone rings."
"Shall we eat together?"
"There are four of us."
"And the trip?"
"Happy birthday, Dad."
"Good morning, General."
"Are you standing?"
"And you, man?"
"Where is Amanda?"
"Even for you."
"Are you reassured?"
"Say your name."
"The routine, what."
"He would do it."
"He's finished."
"You are suspended."
"Look at this girl."
"How much do you earn?"
"If I knew."
"Is it far?"
"And at your place?"
"And his friends?"
"And the parents?"
"But to whom?"
"I liked it."
"I liked it."
"And the light?"
"A good idea."
"At three o'clock."
"Nobody shoots."
"Stand up straight."
"It will be different."
"Tonight, yes."
"Call the others."
"Where is James?"
"Who wants to try?"
"Make yourself useful."
"No, do it."
"Yes, not you?"
"It is clear."
"That reminds me."
"Not without a mandate."
"We have changed."
"I'm being watched."
"No, I'm coming."
"Be clearer."
"Be clearer."
"Nowadays."
"Except me."
"Upwards."
"You're serious."
"I promise nothing."
"He went up."
"When I can."
"In what condition?"
"With the tongue."
"It's foolproof."
"Where is Connor?"
"Yes, go ahead."
"Take the orders."
"He understands me."
"It's appropriate."
"This is the living room."
"Oh, thank you, thank you."
"Each to their own."
"No right."
"Doors open."
"You shouldn't have come."
"Red wine."
"They can wait."
"What are you selling?"
"It won't last."
"I'm going to turn it on."
"So tell me."
"Your grandmother?"
"Stand up."
"Pack your things."
"Like a child."
"Park here."
"Yeah, that'll be fine."
"Bring it down."
"A one-way ticket."
"Three against one."
"I am kind."
"Is that it?"
"It's automatic."
"Goodbye, Billy."
"Another woman?"
"See for yourself."
"Can you walk?"
"No more signal."
"Since my birth."
"It's gigantic."
"Let us in."
"And the door?"
"He laughed."
"Are you happy?"
"Look at your face."
"He is fabulous."
"Same for you."
"It was close."
"Latest news."
"Yes, very true."
"Abroad."
"I can't wait."
"Let him finish."
"You will go far."
"You love it."
"I was just checking."
"They are watching me."
"But of course."
"In the briefcase."
"Just one sip."
"I understand that."
"More pressure."
"I confessed."
"How would I know?"
"It's quiet."
"Take the message."
"Do you want to?"
"Are you sitting?"
"And college?"
"She is fast."
"It's convenient."
"Do you like to dance?"
"He will call back."
"The bank wins."
"Drink with me."
"You are wanted."
"My first love."
"Why did you come?"
"Yeah, over there."
"I miss mom."
"To absent friends."
"He knows what?"
"What do you mean, 'we'?"
"Let's think about it."
"Engine room."
"It's perfect."
"Can't you guess?"
"Cream and sugar?"
"We were close."
"Where does this lead?"
"Please wait a moment."
"After dinner."
"Safety first."
"I was happy."
"Turn this off."
"So why not?"
"Yours faithfully."
"Hey, how are you?"
"Are you still working?"
"Perfect, let's go."
"True, true."
"Well, let's see."
"That's wise."
"Should I?"
"Roger that, Galactica."
"Let me summarize."
"For a while."
"We talked."
"Happy Mardi Gras."
"That evening."
"What to do there?"
"You are innocent."
"Do you have it?"
"I prayed."
"I have to go back."
"You are direct."
"Yes, for example."
"What would he do?"
"And your brother?"
"With friends."
"Thank you, my dear."
"Hold on, kiddo."
"He is famous."
"For the crew."
"To ours."
"He's going home."
"I'm watching you."
"No power."
"Keep me informed."
"I'll take it."
"It's taking shape."
"But go ahead."
"Do you speak Italian?"
"Do you want to repeat?"
"I know now."
"It's recorded."
"When do we start?"
"Here's his number."
"I practice."
"I will pray."
"Let's eat."
"What would you say?"
"Well, you see."
"And forever."
"To the right."
"All right, let's begin."
"Are you sure?"
"No need to wait."
"Thirty-one."
"Bathroom."
"We must cross."
"You are observant."
"A phone rings."
"Six or seven."
"Come on, good luck."
"Rule number one."
"Not now, darling."
"And be careful."
"No TV."
"And why not?"
"I help myself."
"You are the same."
"A good deal."
"On my desk."
"No promises."
"She is sorry."
"A true genius."
"Put your arms down."
"Stay on the ground."
"I didn't know that."
"At the station."
"How does it feel?"
"I want to start again."
"Let me stay."
"Everything is wrapped up."
"Pizza."
"You can change."
"No mandate."
"I'm Nick."
"Take a step back."
"Can you translate?"
"Can you translate?"
"You will be perfect."
"And the third?"
"Where is Dan?"
"Can you write?"
"Use your power."
"Clear and clean."
"He was young."
"Five or six."
"You're done for."
"Do you believe it?"
"It will be better."
"This is Lauren."
"He asked."
"This is Phil."
"Open your gift."
"At the time."
"Do you understand?"
"Yes, my adjutant."
"Look down."
"Stand it up."
"That should be enough."
"Does he come often?"
"Do you know any?"
"But you too."
"This is Michelle."
"Mom came home."
"And the victim?"
"He wants to talk."
"Done and done."
"And your name?"
"Madam is served."
"Without wanting to."
"He is amazing."
"And the party?"
"At what address?"
"We should get started."
"How can I?"
"And up there?"
"For fun."
"I want to resign."
"He is a policeman."
"How is he?"
"But he does."
"We accept it."
"Can I come?"
"Not good, that."
"I would like to understand."
"At your disposal."
"Toothache."
"Under what pretext?"
"Hold your breath."
"Let it go."
"Well, not exactly."
"You have to pay."
"Let it go."
"And drugs?"
"I have to clean."
"Do you want to touch?"
"You're smart."
"Watch TV."
"That's the idea."
"I owe you?"
"You will find it."
"Just a girl."
"Let's celebrate."
"I'm the same."
"Let me listen."
"And you?"
"Use your imagination."
"It's Mickey."
"I'm taking advantage of it."
"Housemaid."
"I'm creating a diversion."
"When is he leaving?"
"The classic move."
"Power outage."
"Watch out, man."
"Who, for example?"
"Where is Crichton?"
"Who do you want?"
"It's up to you."
"When is she coming?"
"Short time."
"With a friend."
"I will order."
"Goodbye, Bob."
"And high school?"
"I will be kind."
"Can you count?"
"Nothing works."
"Now, over to you."
"I do the same."
"And his face?"
"On the wall."
"Everything was planned."
"All three."
"Merry Christmas, Dad."
"I imagine so."
"Thank you for what?"
"Keep playing."
"It's served."
"Need money?"
"How to find it?"
"She's tough."
"Are you sleepy?"
"How much do we have?"
"How much do we have?"
"I tell you."
"I don't have any."
"And here it is."
"She won't come."
"We'll talk about it."
"Go ahead, Mom."
"No, mine."
"He is here."
"Follow this car."
"I like to watch."
"I am intelligent."
"Where is Teddy?"
"It's going fast."
"Captain's orders."
"So many deaths."
"Yes, I would love to."
"Will you introduce me?"
"Not only that."
"Look at the result."
"Thank you, dear."
"She is recovering."
"Do you have anything better?"
"What do they have?"
"What are you reading?"
"Put on your glasses."
"Side by side."
"Put it in."
"You must act."
"The other night."
"He has some."
"Like a bird."
"Space?"
"Is this real?"
"Here's an idea."
"So, you see?"
"Say good night."
"This one too."
"Do you believe me?"
"Police check."
"He worked here."
"Come in, guys."
"No rush."
"For the family."
"Not like here."
"Were you serious?"
"What do they say?"
"Pie?"
"Do you know how to fly?"
"Do you miss him?"
"I am a soldier."
"Okay, come on."
"I'm taking a shower."
"Where is Jamie?"
"I love to dance."
"In the parking lot."
"It pisses me off."
"It was sincere."
"But tell me."
"Change places."
"She has everything."
"All his life."
"Look at this one."
"Tea or coffee?"
"We have to think."
"All mine."
"Is he far away?"
"She will know."
"Do you know how to dance?"
"We fucked."
"It's going great."
"We have to see."
"Well received, check."
"A real lady."
"No, for nothing."
"Call back later."
"You came."
"No, that one."
"Once is enough."
"A good thing."
"Are you against it?"
"Are you against it?"
"Plus the fees."
"Would you like that?"
"They are chasing us."
"Like a woman."
"How many were there?"
"Your real name."
"Get in there."
"Just to talk."
"We are delighted."
"It was splendid."
"Bring them in."
"They are new."
"You will heal."
"Good for you."
"Good for you."
"So, how are you doing?"
"There you go, you see?"
"And I know."
"I was following you."
"Try to follow."
"You have to."
"To see what?"
"The great love."
"Do your duty."
"He drank."
"We have started."
"Well, I guess."
"I cooked."
"We are full."
"Better than anyone."
"She is absent."
"Marijuana."
"Where is Castle?"
"Or this one?"
"Look at these people."
"Do it quickly."
"Come here, man."
"Just the three of us."
"I had confidence."
"We adapt."
"On your desktop."
"Hey, calm down."
"You are being watched."
"What would he say?"
"Good night, boss."
"You have to go in."
"For your safety."
"Are you sisters?"
"This is Kim."
"Sorry, my love."
"What are they like?"
"What are they like?"
"Are you surprised?"
"The weekend."
"I will listen to you."
"On the chair."
"Classified ads."
"Put your arms down."
"So what now?"
"Mr. Secretary."
"Just two minutes."
"Roll up your sleeve."
"And my men?"
"And me with it."
"Make yourself comfortable."
"Cover yourself well."
"I will be discreet."
"Now get lost."
"Like yours."
"She will get there."
"Control room."
"It's incurable."
"There were four of them."
"All the way up."
"As much as needed."
"You are hired."
"I must intervene."
"By what means?"
"A small town."
"Yes, for a moment."
"Take over."
"Look straight ahead."
"All or nothing."
"I guess so."
"Yes, what then?"
"Let me breathe."
"For a woman."
"Farewell, my son."
"Shall we dance?"
"Who would have thought?"
"Look right."
"Follow a little."
"And you, Mom?"
"What do you feel?"
"Show me a little."
"We start all over again."
"For one night."
"Is it permanent?"
"Lots of people."
"What do you eat?"
"It's elegant."
"Come, my brother."
"Which one was it?"
"Make your report."
"Are you going to try?"
"You are a writer."
"You dance well."
"He plays well."
"Were you following me?"
"Good evening, how are you?"
"I'm looking at this."
"It's finished."
"It's over."
"Look at her carefully."
"Welcome to the USA."
"Easy, my dear."
"From both of you."
"She is sensitive."
"I follow them."
"And if not?"
"On what subject?"
"It can be learned."
"Open this for me."
"Where would he go?"
"Come, my love."
"Come, my love."
"Raise your arm."
"I love it."
"Old friends."
"We loved each other."
"A charming woman."
"Are you going to throw up?"
"You are tall."
"She liked it."
"And the trunk?"
"And with you."
"Thanks, me too."
"It's on purpose."
"I'm holding on."
"We will come back to this."
"You smiled."
"Thanks, by the way."
"His right arm."
"Need what?"
"They were friends."
"It's sacred."
"What to watch out for?"
"Usually, yes."
"Just a few words."
"Not after that."
"They withdraw."
"Twenty percent."
"But later."
"Let's do something else."
"Go wash yourself."
"Prepare your things."
"You have to try."
"For three years."
"Watch and learn."
"Do you prefer that?"
"Do us a favor."
"Put down that gun."
"Do you see this?"
"I'm Bob."
"Where is Tina?"
"On the desk."
"Continue straight ahead."
"What are you looking for?"
"Let it all out."
"Let's be clear."
"No camera."
"She doesn't know."
"Be a man."
"What a beautiful story."
"This guy."
"More than anyone."
"There you go."
"And gold?"
"A simple formality."
"Hi, my dear."
"Just a minute, honey."
"They are behind."
"He is wanted."
"Good night, son."
"Which one do you prefer?"
"Which one do you prefer?"
"She had disappeared."
"What were you waiting for?"
"Happy Valentine's Day."
"Send reinforcements."
"It's peaceful."
"Gather your things."
"What is he looking for?"
"One last thing."
"I see clearly."
"A picnic?"
"You are punished."
"Well, good."
"So, what about you?"
"Pure genius."
"Oh, that's enough."
"Don't go down."
"I guide you."
"Are we going?"
"Hello and welcome."
"What order?"
"Rest now."
"We will protect you."
"You have to wait."
"It was sure."
"Tell them."
"A real treat."
"Not yours."
"Shall we drop you off?"
"In the ice."
"Two thousand dollars."
"This is Greg."
"There is your answer."
"In a word."
"You will be free."
"He'll manage."
"It comforts me."
"Doesn't answer."
"No key."
"Can you turn it off?"
"Come on board."
"No, another one."
"Call your father."
"Please identify yourself."
"He helps us."
"It's spectacular."
"You can continue."
"Do you feel me?"
"Winter is coming."
"You will never change."
"So let's do it."
"Mom is waiting for you."
"It will be good."
"Come on, off to bed."
"You are strong."
"You are strong."
"Call the cops?"
"This is my father."
"Twenty-five years old."
"You could hit."
"Did you notice?"
"One more round."
"Yes, in theory."
"Here is the central."
"How much for that?"
"We were there."
"No, keep it."
"This is Julia."
"She was innocent."
"Did you sleep?"
"Stay close."
"He is getting married."
"At least two."
"Tell me about it."
"The White House."
"Listen to yourself speak."
"Open your eyes."
"Not far enough."
"Intubation tray."
"So, anything new?"
"Nice and warm."
"Oh, there you are."
"Everything is clear."
"He is happy."
"For three months."
"Can we see?"
"Make some coffee."
"Who do you love?"
"Is she coming here?"
"Without a word."
"I take everything back."
"She looks like you."
"Yes, once."
"This is Kitty."
"He's still breathing."
"And so much the better."
"How do you do it?"
"And the two of us?"
"That one, yes."
"Open the cell."
"Oh yeah, why?"
"I live there."
"Back off, guys."
"He'll start again."
"I belong to you."
"Give them back to me."
"But not before."
"Do something else."
"You're tough."
"And in return?"
"Not now, thank you."
"Yes, I'm fine."
"You are old."
"This is Walt."
"This is Ross."
"Here, sweetie."
"She slipped."
"On the mouth."
"And the movie?"
"Yes, among others."
"Far from everything."
"No, stay there."
"That much?"
"Go apologize."
"Take the camera."
"Go see mom."
"The others are coming."
"He is in front."
"Relax, man."
"Try to guess."
"The last two."
"How was he?"
"Yes, right?"
"I start on Monday."
"Go see them."
"This is Andrew."
"Let's call a truce."
"Unbelievable but true."
"I'm leaving."
"Where are you running to?"
"She is a model."
"Come through here."
"Come, my friend."
"And you others?"
"Any last words?"
"Can you come?"
"They are clean."
"I pay you."
"God knows where."
"You are splendid."
"Here is my offer."
"You don't want anything?"
"Call this number."
"At the doctor's."
"No, stay here."
"The same day."
"Are we still friends?"
"I am Mr."
"That would suit me."
"Where to start?"
"Yes, my heart."
"Where is Benton?"
"He'll be back soon."
"This is House."
"This is Rick."
"She is human."
"Good luck, darling."
"I like it."
"We had it."
"I love cooking."
"Do you feel it?"
"Keep working."
"Are you going to play?"
"What do you understand?"
"You will like it."
"Who's thirsty?"
"They are in it."
"She is an adult."
"Go ahead, doctor."
"This is Nate."
"No, look at me."
"Go on, my son."
"Slow forward."
"What were they like?"
"You love it."
"It's worth thinking about."
"Time will tell."
"He is hard."
"We're leaving now."
"Dressed like that?"
"I'm going to turn it off."
"To see me?"
"She will win."
"He was tall."
"Wait for the rest."
"Speak more quietly."
"Enough for what?"
"We're arguing."
"It was justified."
"Did you think so?"
"This is Nina."
"What do you hear?"
"Let's eat first."
"What would you like?"
"He will be ready."
"Calm down everyone."
"We made it happen."
"How many sugars?"
"Milk and sugar?"
"Come on a second."
"Painting."
"Does it still exist?"
"This is Patrick."
"She was wonderful."
"Keep rolling."
"I quite like it."
"Are you coming to dance?"
"Turn on the TV."
"You are invited."
"It might be useful."
"I have to revise."
"You are new."
"We are young."
"We have them."
"All others."
"Are you taken?"
"Hold your tongue."
"Go ahead, move forward."
"It was nobody."
"Not there yet."
"Dad is mean."
"No to what?"
"The real reason?"
"Not so close."
"This is Jamie."
"Take two."
"I'm awesome."
"Just one glass."
"Yes, my little one."
"He is English."
"I respect them."
"It is off."
"With the children."
"Here is the explanation."
"He is a photographer."
"This is your room."
"You are in love."
"Any particular reason?"
"Thank you, my friends."
"Are you an engineer?"
"You interest me."
"Who are you protecting?"
"Just above."
"This is Leonard."
"Make a wish."
"Do it, you."
"You will be rewarded."
"It looked like it."
"This is Richie."
"Where do you live?"
"Well, come in."
"What do you think?"
"Be at peace."
"Hey, guys."
"Have a good day."
"Do you want to walk?"
"What did you expect?"
"It itches."
"What's beautiful?"
"She is blonde."
"We hope so."
"You're hot."
"Have a coffee."
"Twenty-two years old."
"I want to drink."
"Here, my man."
"Take stock."
"No survivors."
"I will marry you."
"This is Maya."
"I rang."
"Your name again?"
"Your time will come."
"I'll take that."
"Are you high?"
"Garlic."
"You are kind."
"You are nice."
"You are nice."
"Do you have this?"
"Take your seats again."
"Where is Holly?"
"Certainly not me."
"It's a priority."
"Describe it to me."
"It's Batman."
"I guess so too."
"This is Nathan."
"How do they do it?"
"I am left-handed."
"Yes, very pretty."
"Yes, for a long time."
"Let her sleep."
"Here, try this."
"Are they real?"
"Analysis in progress."
"He is sleeping soundly."
"He loved you."
"Thank you for your patience."
"Where is Damon?"
"Can she hear me?"
"What is this?"
"Yes, at first."
"It's up to you."
"She is amazing."
"In six months."
"Never heard of that."
"This is Bauer."
"With pleasure, madam."
"Not my style."
"Got it?"
"You're leaving tomorrow."
"Ask your questions."
"Well, see you tomorrow."
"Take your time."
"You do it."
"Yes, my master."
"I am patient."
"Not to him."
"We were close."
"Better for whom?"
"I have to go."
"You have arrived."
"Lower your hand."
"Where does he live?"
"Are you Catholic?"
"You first."
"And your head?"
"You should watch."
"Not his."
"Will you introduce us?"
"Have you thought about it?"
"It's closed."
"But why is that?"
"When will you come back?"
"I'm tempted."
"But from you."
"I'm leaving soon."
"Here is the solution."
"Who wants to play?"
"I am you."
"You will see it."
"No messages."
"Just one week."
"We'll be fine."
"Now, let's get to work."
"To my father."
"I could go on."
"You wouldn't dare."
"So, how was this day?"
"Is it reliable?"
"You start tomorrow."
"She's fair."
"Good evening, my dear."
"To buy what?"
"God bless her."
"He's up for it."
"No reason."
"Shouts of joy."
"Come this way."
"In the north."
"Under the bridge."
"What do we win?"
"For dinner."
"That makes one."
"Where is Howard?"
"The storm is approaching."
"I'm watching you."
"How much is left?"
"She is small."
"Find it for me."
"This is Elena."
"A good boy."
"I'll open the door for you."
"Okay, good night."
"I am positive."
"Is it better?"
"It can change."
"I must insist."
"More games."
"It is safe."
"Hello yourself."
"End of the game."
"Praise be to Him."
"I was curious."
"Do you speak Russian?"
"It is huge."
"She is huge."
"Work for me."
"Let me laugh."
"Do you speak Italian?"
"We are hungry."
"Answer me honestly."
"Come and get them."
"You are beautiful."
"Join the others."
"The biggest."
"Whenever I want."
"Are you going to give up?"
"Where is Kim?"
"I am sitting."
"Are you going away for a long time?"
"We will try."
"What do you like?"
"All right, now."
"Trust him."
"They will call back."
"Hey, listen to me."
"Where is Zach?"
"Look left."
"And the key?"
"He will listen to me."
"It seemed like."
"Thank you for calling."
"For the wedding."
"I was looking at this."
"No, after you."
"Where is Linda?"
"He paid."
"I am served."
"Keep me informed."
"What do you decide?"
"Most of them, yes."
"How much is it?"
"What did you want?"
"We will find her again."
"What do you answer?"
"Your pass."
"I lived."
"Are you watching me?"
"Let them pass."
"You can."
"I would be honored."
"And a woman."
"When are you coming back?"
"Do you speak Japanese?"
"In what form?"
"Give it a try."
"There are three of us."
"She is uncontrollable."
"One for me."
"In the subway."
"And the press?"
"She is fresh."
"Farewell, my friends."
"At a party."
"No more alcohol."
"Were you sincere?"
"You are famous."
"The bridal suite."
"What did you think?"
"Where is Oliver?"
"I stayed."
"Keep pressing."
"Take your hand away."
"It's beyond us."
"Where is Fiona?"
"She's harassing me."
"She is rich."
"Everything is done."
"Good night, miss."
"A double whiskey."
"I'm smart."
"This is acceptable."
"There you have it, sir."
"In the afternoon?"
"We want it."
"Good morning, Your Honor."
"Clean this up for me."
"Goodbye, Sergeant."
"Now I can."
"And my parents?"
"Why protect it?"
"Upside down?"
"Let them come."
"Can we cut?"
"She is cured."
"That will suit me."
"Do you want to listen?"
"I hire you."
"Are you satisfied?"
"This is my office."
"I'm a widower."
"Finished the work."
"He is smart."
"One less."
"This is Melissa."
"No luck."
"Do you want to come?"
"That's a bitch."
"Yes, ma'am."
"Honey, look at me."
"Gather your men."
"And yet, yes."
"Not very strong."
"This is Deb."
"Lay down your weapons."
"How much does it cost?"
"An old acquaintance."
"No judgment."
"Are you a lawyer?"
"Open your bag."
"It's slippery."
"It is justified."
"Not a minute."
"He is suffering."
"She's changing."
"Where is Toby?"
"Let's try this way."
"Are you in a hurry?"
"Name and number?"
"We will come."
"Just one word."
"Let's find a solution."
"Let's talk about us."
"Where is Stan?"
"Is that so?"
"And your meeting?"
"Bathroom."
"Can you drive?"
"You don't see anything?"
"Thank you, my daughter."
"The game begins."
"Not for a long time."
"It's Mary."
"Art."
"Gather the men."
"Congratulations, my boy."
"Look at the stars."
"He is stressed."
"Who do I see?"
"It's organic."
"That's enough, thank you."
"More than you."
"Here's the boss."
"She is pure."
"Ah, you think so?"
"Routine check-up."
"Are you receiving us?"
"Which one are you?"
"Eat your soup."
"Excuse me again."
"In this state?"
"To the police."
"Thanks to that."
"Here is your change."
"In his dreams."
"Do you like it?"
"There you are."
"Permanently."
"Look at the picture."
"Since you insist."
"All in position."
"You are cute."
"I belong to him."
"Doctor's orders."
"Come on, let me see."
"He protects me."
"Where is Mother?"
"You are tough."
"You are brilliant."
"You are brilliant."
"I appreciate you."
"Not with her."
"Read it to me."
"Here is the number."
"Conference room."
"How will you do it?"
"How will you do it?"
"Call my lawyer."
"This is Hollywood."
"It's dramatic."
"Leave it here."
"But guess what?"
"What do you hope for?"
"That would be better."
"She is famous."
"It was God."
"From the United States."
"I recognize them."
"Him first."
"Previously on Alias."
"You arrive late."
"Are you interested?"
"Follow my voice."
"Just a second, honey."
"Really very good."
"Have you looked?"
"It was confidential."
"In the building."
"I'm waiting for them."
"Just like her."
"We are lucky."
"This is Jackie."
"Take my card."
"Let me come."
"Call my wife."
"Research in progress."
"Who knows why?"
"So, let's go."
"Unauthorized access."
"I'm Will."
"Where is Cameron?"
"In what capacity?"
"That will teach you."
"Get out of the vehicle."
"All right, Dad."
"And her husband?"
"Goal in sight."
"So, explain to me."
"Look at your hair."
"I respect her."
"Tell me frankly."
"We believe you."
"Bring it back here."
"We will continue."
"I am special."
"This is the bridge."
"No discussions."
"They knew each other."
"I would do the same."
"I am proud."
"She wants me."
"In two words."
"Here's your coffee."
"Are you holding on?"
"Just a dream."
"Everything is complete."
"Not so bad?"
"For our children."
"I will have some."
"This old thing?"
"You are expected."
"None of your business."
"Do you want to participate?"
"Let's go, man."
"Don't think."
"Try it like this."
"Let me stay."
"I ask him."
"Where is Derek?"
"This is Wu."
"In his apartment."
"And the jewelry?"
"On the second floor."
"I like to work."
"I forgive him."
"Like tonight."
"Good luck, old man."
"Four, five, six."
"Thank you, Mr. Stevens."
"But not only that."
"What was she wearing?"
"A true story."
"You are an accomplice."
"They know what?"
"This is Lily."
"She wanted it."
"Not with us."
"No, to no one."
"Thank you, with pleasure."
"Here's my idea."
"They were together."
"Open the bag."
"We lift it up."
"Where is Tim?"
"He is involved."
"Yes, I should."
"Do you want to sing?"
"Hello, my sister."
"From all of you."
"Here's your ticket."
"From New Jersey."
"A good man."
"Here are the papers."
"Notify the police."
"A new message."
"This is Beth."
"Read it yourself."
"They are the same."
"The pressure is mounting."
"Nobody comes in."
"He will win."
"Would you like to?"
"Are you happy?"
"I completely understand."
"I am a father."
"Close your mouth."
"A storm is coming."
"Half a day."
"Let's race."
"Bunch of amateurs."
"Who will it be?"
"One is enough."
"He is stunned."
"Women, huh?"
"The whole team."
"Sorry, dear."
"We hear you."
"Who cares?"
"Do you miss her?"
"This is Natalie."
"Go ahead, look."
"She exploded."
"Are you leaving us?"
"That's my question."
"Here is the proof."
"You have to do it."
"It will be cool."
"They know you."
"Come, my love."
"What, how come?"
"Breathe in and out."
"For you, sir."
"Try to sleep."
"Go ahead, start."
"Good evening, Father."
"In my house."
"Here is the deal."
"Try this one."
"Try this one."
"In this season?"
"She's behind."
"My lucky charm."
"Put down the phone."
"I'm working tomorrow."
"Goodbye, Ben."
"Bring her to me."
"I want to hear."
"Are you thinking about it?"
"Good, ma'am."
"Do you know how to cook?"
"How are they?"
"A good start."
"Follow the money."
"No, right."
"God is love."
"Rebuild your life."
"He liked it."
"One second, sir."
"Witchcraft."
"We'll start again tomorrow."
"Are you friends?"
"On the island?"
"Hello, my handsome."
"Pack your bag."
"Just the truth."
"I think I know."
"She knows him."
"How much do you earn?"
"She can stay."
"Call for reinforcements."
"Are you a student?"
"I signed."
"Money?"
"Can you lower it?"
"You are heavy."
"In the parking lot."
"I am attached."
"I work there."
"Am I clear?"
"Fill up."
"Nothing will change."
"Well, not anymore."
"And the contract?"
"Just a moment, sir."
"Get a lawyer."
"We'll be fine."
"Try something else."
"She was special."
"Keep playing."
"Oh, too bad."
"And my children?"
"Have a cigarette."
"It will be magnificent."
"Are we finished?"
"Yes, but when?"
"They move."
"But calm down."
"Take a taxi."
"So far, yes."
"I protect you."
"It's locked."
"What are you writing?"
"Husband and wife."
"Did you order?"
"Look straight ahead."
"Have some tea."
"What were they saying?"
"I choose you."
"Everything is ready."
"How many shots?"
"Let's go further."
"Excuse me, Mom."
"How fast?"
"Mom, look at me."
"Not strong enough."
"It complicates everything."
"This is Milo."
"It is blue."
"I loved them."
"You look alike."
"What is it for?"
"You were great."
"Sing with me."
"Yes, good luck."
"Let's go say hello."
"She walked."
"We'll do it again."
"The doctor arrives."
"And your friend?"
"Let's take a tour."
"Wait for the signal."
"No, I don't know."
"All right, boss."
"I'm mean."
"Choose your side."
"He's manipulating you."
"In principle, yes."
"It is open."
"Are you leaving now?"
"Which one is it?"
"This is Carlos."
"No more coffee?"
"Coconut."
"You have to decide."
"Can you sign?"
"What do we want?"
"With a woman."
"Like clockwork."
"He always wins."
"They will know."
"Hold my hand."
"This sucks."
"I will come tomorrow."
"And the evidence?"
"Go ahead, keep going."
"Try to guess."
"I was married."
"In the entrance."
"So much the better, then."
"You can land."
"Now we know."
"We will have to wait."
"Need company?"
"It will be great."
"Call my office."
"For two years."
"Climb in there."
"This is Caroline."
"Choose a hand."
"How old?"
"Can I finish?"
"Right, Bob?"
"Don't try."
"Don't rush."
"Let's make an appointment."
"Try to follow."
"A remarkable man."
"For a few months now."
"I'm enjoying myself."
"Out loud."
"My little sister."
"Too many people."
"It's still raining."
"You were amazing."
"You're right."
"On the cheek."
"Is everything okay?"
"Where is Lee?"
"This is Catherine."
"He fights."
"I'll find you."
"It obsesses me."
"Will you teach me?"
"What is it?"
"No dog."
"Set the table."
"They are cute."
"Yes, we know."
"Behind the head."
"In your head."
"Patience, my friend."
"The bell rings."
"It's experimental."
"Now leave me."
"Yes, it's coming."
"No trial."
"Tuck in your shirt."
"Look up."
"Are you a surgeon?"
"There you go, my dear."
"Keep a close eye on him."
"Eat something."
"He is soaked."
"That's the difference."
"He is hungry."
"I am a mechanic."
"I respect that."
"How does it end?"
"We have booked."
"This is Jill."
"She works there."
"Look, look, look."
"Come to me."
"This is Lucas."
"We must go up."
"Now I understand."
"There you go, buddy."
"There was."
"Form a circle."
"Take a card."
"Where is he?"
"Oh, come here."
"Give me a sign."
"Give it to him."
"Can you fix it?"
"We knew it."
"No, you see."
"At least one."
"In my opinion."
"They are small."
"He is near."
"It obsesses him."
"Don't call anyone."
"Cause and effect."
"What do you need?"
"Take off your hat."
"A happy family."
"Are you coming to play?"
"Not from you."
"Where do you sleep?"
"He will find us."
"Did you accept?"
"He breathes more."
"Pause."
"Before the war."
"You guessed it."
"Of all kinds."
"Witness protection."
"This is Chloe."
"You know that?"
"We called."
"Yes, but who?"
"And the cameras?"
"You'd better."
"Look at this thing."
"They are new."
"Sorry for you."
"Don't listen."
"Mr. Deputy."
"A white man."
"It looks good."
"They divorced."
"What's it about?"
"I envy them."
"We waited."
"Can she talk?"
"Who says what?"
"That was enough."
"We are good."
"She was adorable."
"You mean?"
"Spread the word."
"What were they like?"
"You had it."
"My little finger."
"She will get better."
"Every detail counts."
"You are hilarious."
"Come closer."
"Who would want that?"
"Are they?"
"I am naked."
"You have to study."
"Let's start with him."
"He parks."
"Well, perfect."
"He is calm."
"Her first."
"Are you stopping?"
"In the fireplace."
"You have to believe me."
"We're talking business."
"Take off your dress."
"What do we bet?"
"Try it anyway."
"We are happy."
"You would like her."
"You do that?"
"This is Tara."
"It needs to be checked."
"You are tall."
"As you prefer."
"Look at this one."
"Fit for work."
"She is powerful."
"On your left."
"Put on your mask."
"Take the helm."
"I am famous."
"It's technical."
"This is Lee."
"This is Leo."
"Not good enough."
"He is there."
"Have a cigar."
"You, over there."
"Not a soul."
"And with you."
"They love you."
"Let's keep calm."
"You're not eating?"
"Yes, well?"
"Go play outside."
"Well done, man."
"And a good one."
"Not very subtle."
"No party."
"I want to try again."
"And the man?"
"Let her in."
"Stretch out your arm."
"At my desk."
"I demand it."
"I am a singer."
"Where is Frankie?"
"I'm going to work."
"At my age?"
"To the sea."
"Why so late?"
"She didn't know."
"Great, thank you very much."
"Since my childhood."
"This is Betty."
"More champagne?"
"From the back."
"My respects, madam."
"Are you inviting me?"
"This is Marcus."
"Do you want to learn?"
"Keep working."
"They came back."
"It will pass quickly."
"Hello, Mr. Crown."
"Call me back soon."
"Shields at maximum."
"Everything is great."
"He is fascinating."
"Put down that phone."
"You will like it."
"You will like it."
"Hello, my children."
"Yes, I hear."
"Take off your boots."
"It might work."
"I'll bring it."
"You should check."
"Keep digging."
"Keep digging."
"Prepare your men."
"A short circuit."
"This is Angel."
"Come see us."
"Come see us."
"This is my family."
"You are human."
"This is Donna."
"Let him speak."
"In the tunnel."
"No later."
"Are you a member?"
"Block the exits."
"They will have it."
"Play what?"
"Sorry, folks."
"Ready for what?"
"I read."
"I'm leaving again tomorrow."
"No identification."
"And the money?"
"Not yet."
"Keep talking."
"Here, drink this."
"I am Jewish."
"Thank you for your support."
"Welcome to the club."
"And the dogs?"
"We will continue tomorrow."
"Be with me."
"How much do you bet?"
"Your last meeting?"
"For others."
"But good luck."
"Can you walk?"
"I have to go back up."
"Do you feel it?"
"I want to listen."
"And beyond?"
"Starting tonight."
"He was white."
"The game begins."
"In a few weeks."
"I won't pay."
"But I work."
"Bring her up."
"We can talk."
"On what occasion?"
"Here is mine."
"Here is mine."
"He gets dressed."
"Where is Ian?"
"Let me understand."
"What do you want?"
"No, over there."
"Let's go next door."
"Not by you."
"It's uncontrollable."
"Where is Caroline?"
"Do you know how to do it?"
"It's loaded."
"I will repeat."
"Thank you, I think."
"Everything is real."
"She will listen to you."
"No more trouble."
"And look at me."
"And look at me."
"Goodbye, ladies."
"For two days."
"I really appreciate it."
"Can you elaborate?"
"We will find them."
"Thank you, Thing."
"You are in love."
"For now."
"There were several of them."
"No more power."
"This is your office."
"What do you mean, me?"
"You should consult."
"The Last Judgment."
"Where is Jeremy?"
"Hello, ma'am."
"He's arriving tomorrow."
"Happy birthday, darling."
"Happy birthday, darling."
"About two years."
"At the hairdresser's."
"Thanks to whom?"
"Are you holding me?"
"At the door."
"It's Monday."
"He's watching us."
"I didn't understand."
"Not very often."
"Right in front of you."
"It costs nothing."
"So prove it."
"I am a volunteer."
"Wait over there."
"In the wardrobe."
"God knows what."
"This is Heather."
"It was brilliant."
"Come with me."
"We are human."
"And what now?"
"Go through there."
"When do I go out?"
"You are engaged."
"You are committed."
"Lock the door."
"For girls."
"I would say that."
"Who's left?"
"And you?"
"You wanted it."
"Hold out your hand."
"Have you been drinking?"
"Are you up?"
"The fastest."
"Go ahead, madam."
"She was unique."
"Let them in."
"Nor for you."
"Don't sleep."
"Lower your voice."
"Back home."
"Don't ask for anything."
"Are you reading this?"
"Ten more minutes."
"You can hear it."
"Just a moment, gentlemen."
"This is Jonathan."
"Night and day."
"As you see."
"Thank you, sir."
"We were in love."
"Come on, you two."
"Be yourself."
"I have to understand."
"Tell us everything."
"Are you going to continue?"
"No, I'm leaving."
"Wait a moment."
"He will understand."
"Exactly like me."
"See you soon then."
"Are you getting there?"
"Do the same."
"Watch out for the doors."
"You ask me?"
"Congratulations to you."
"Everything will be ready."
"Put it here."
"It's getting warmer."
"Like all of us."
"I turn around."
"I was gone."
"Hello, my sister."
"He will live."
"No, just a minute."
"Let's change places."
"I am a consultant."
"We can stay."
"With a man?"
"Do you never knock?"
"Have a drink."
"Yes, we're coming."
"And your men?"
"Very good news."
"I will come back to this."
"How can I explain it to you?"
"What was she doing?"
"Hey, guys."
"Take pictures."
"You are old."
"A hot dog?"
"Use your imagination."
"You can start."
"Except what?"
"There is your answer."
"Have you tried?"
"We'll come back tomorrow."
"I wish so."
"They're going to leave."
"Good people."
"Listen to this."
"Listen to this."
"I heal quickly."
"Are you apologizing?"
"What were you hoping for?"
"Your cards, gentlemen."
"How many women?"
"Why was that?"
"Are you a doctor?"
"Yes, my heart."
"Just a moment longer."
"At one o'clock."
"Hi, how are you?"
"In the van."
"What do I what?"
"It was correct."
"Leave the city."
"And this trip?"
"Who's starting?"
"Where is Olivia?"
"Maid."
"Find one."
"We're fine."
"The camera."
"Are you satisfied?"
"Like a fish."
"And me."
"Let us pray to the Lord."
"Let's go see them."
"Are you looking for us?"
"Each of you."
"Sorry about yesterday."
"Is it fresh?"
"His ex-wife."
"You loved it."
"Just coffee."
"Lift your chin."
"Where is Anne?"
"Hey, brother."
"In what position?"
"Let's take my car."
"Where is House?"
"Until Monday."
"Not me, you."
"Hold your position."
"You could try."
"Take a nap."
"Okay, let's see."
"For business."
"Nothing exciting."
"No children."
"Do you want to work?"
"Grab his legs."
"You can laugh."
"Maybe ten."
"What will it be?"
"What are you studying?"
"Are you going to move?"
"I know who."
"Thanks a lot, man."
"Take notes."
"Call my lawyer."
"Justice is done."
"Business or leisure?"
"Here's your chance."
"Great, let's go."
"It seems so, though."
"Do you live there?"
"She will be ready."
"The other thing."
"The other thing."
"Here is the list."
"I was a cop."
"How's it going, man?"
"Let's start with that."
"Ask me."
"I'll be careful."
"Thank you very much, Dad."
"It was agreed."
"Can we continue?"
"And the driver?"
"He is Russian."
"No, after you."
"No, very well."
"That would be perfect."
"They are serious."
"Here are my friends."
"Call the hospital."
"Me first."
"After work."
"Are you taking him?"
"He is sincere."
"On the counter."
"On your right."
"I control everything."
"Others don't."
"Go ahead, breathe."
"He was huge."
"We're bringing him back."
"You're toast."
"Go clean yourself up."
"I'll go too."
"Who dared?"
"In a car."
"If you accept."
"And in what way?"
"So follow me."
"Yes, very often."
"Thanks, Mom."
"She is white."
"Mr. Minister."
"From both of us."
"This is Christine."
"Did you ring?"
"Is it still holding?"
"Go ahead, touch."
"Let go of my arm."
"How to convince you?"
"He is ambitious."
"It's accurate."
"This is Hannah."
"Real life."
"I don't dare."
"Who votes for?"
"And listen to this."
"They like it."
"So tell me."
"From your father."
"Who replaces him?"
"Make her come."
"Excuse me, old man."
"We are full."
"On my account."
"He will listen to you."
"You deserved it."
"He is here."
"He is known."
"It is necessary."
"What do you suggest?"
"Are you an actor?"
"Nothing, I hope."
"Coke."
"Can you play?"
"I will wear it."
"Finish your glass."
"And my kiss?"
"Another call."
"She is a lawyer."
"Not like some."
"Ah, I know."
"Go ahead, ask."
"Paper or plastic?"
"Do you want me?"
"Easy, boy."
"You will be fine."
"Everything is political."
"Try this one."
"Try this one."
"They come here."
"And you, miss?"
"This changes everything."
"What?"
"Yes, my dear."
"In a motel."
"Come on, be nice."
"It was sexy."
"I'll sort it out."
"You have to go down."
"They are charming."
"That night."
"What are you doing?"
"Put your pants back on."
"They paid."
"You are special."
"Bring it back here."
"There was no one."
"Find a way."
"I am a teacher."
"You are witnesses."
"He will find you."
"Good, my dear."
"Where is Foreman?"
"Come to your senses."
"As much as you."
"She must be sleeping."
"It should work."
"She laughed."
"Well done, Mom."
"Hello, friend."
"This is your captain."
"What, darling?"
"This is Linda."
"I cover it."
"And the doctor?"
"Thank you, good night."
"We're finding out."
"Go ahead, swing."
"Ask your question."
"Let it go."
"In what sense?"
"Know one thing."
"You would do the same."
"Everything is recorded."
"Can you come by?"
"It is intact."
"Oh, come on, man."
"I am satisfied."
"I'm leaving immediately."
"Is it hidden?"
"Are you hurrying?"
"I will succeed."
"No follow-up."
"Go ahead, get in."
"Old school."
"Blonde or brunette?"
"This is Wayne."
"Before my eyes."
"One more day."
"Here is a picture."
"Since childhood."
"Shut up, Hudson."
"What were you looking for?"
"You should answer."
"Early this morning."
"I pick it up."
"Can you talk?"
"Can we call?"
"Here is my proposal."
"Who farted?"
"How many points?"
"Do you have it?"
"It's a given."
"You see there?"
"Come on, guys."
"Talk to me again."
"Not for a long time."
"Shall we take you?"
"I gave up."
"This is going to be awesome."
"Where is Tracy?"
"I got it."
"I would eat well."
"Right over left."
"This thing?"
"You are good."
"A small favor."
"Go ahead, try it."
"It's thrilling."
"Who would know?"
"Hello to you."
"Do you want to share?"
"To be sure."
"Now it's my turn."
"They were there."
"I'm ok."
"In our room."
"Where is Lauren?"
"Enough with that."
"A fine specimen."
"Well, then?"
"The police are investigating."
"Welcome, my friends."
"A Saturday night?"
"I worked."
"Come have fun."
"With others."
"Nothing moves."
"I'm in front."
"Goodbye, Inspector."
"At my sister's."
"The big game."
"I worked there."
"You will see me again."
"We survived."
"Forever."
"We must start again."
"Do it right."
"Actually, yeah."
"Can I turn it off?"
"From San Francisco."
"We love it."
"How are you?"
"Where is Rebecca?"
"They are different."
"Where is Eli?"
"Excuse me, Mr."
"You look lovely."
"Ready to play?"
"Can you fly?"
"Do you want to feel?"
"Yes, Comrade Captain."
"Block the door."
"At what age?"
"Are you pregnant?"
"Save lives."
"Give it a try."
"Who wants it?"
"Hey, honey."
"In two months."
"And my uncle?"
"From you?"
"Where is Ichi?"
"So, let it go."
"There are several of them."
"Look at this face."
"You will have some."
"This is Derek."
"We are wanted."
"Where is Barney?"
"Give it to him."
"Call this number."
"This is Ethan."
"Stand here."
"After school."
"The most beautiful."
"I will go."
"And now?"
"At a friend's house."
"We welcome you."
"No woman."
"Goodbye, James."
"Who knew?"
"Another chance?"
"Do you have everything?"
"Everything is wonderful."
"Here is the proof."
"Generally, yes."
"Hello, my boy."
"More power."
"Who is she?"
"They must know."
"And the mobile?"
"Let's talk a little."
"Look inside."
"Oh, my back."
"To find what?"
"Tell me a little."
"Me too, man."
"Good night, professor."
"Let me in."
"They can come back."
"Where is Paige?"
"The car is waiting."
"But why us?"
"You, be careful."
"You are standing."
"Good, my commander."
"They live here."
"It was moving."
"In the mountains."
"How to say no?"
"Where were we?"
"You're fast."
"Can you talk?"
"She belongs to you."
"Are you going out?"
"Are you going out?"
"Where is Shane?"
"Listen to my voice."
"I wasn't looking."
"Watch the door."
"We had him."
"Where is Cody?"
"And for a long time."
"Let us go."
"I'll replace you."
"A few more days."
"They will find you."
"Go with mom."
"Too many questions."
"Why the police?"
"Just one shot."
"I am him."
"At the very bottom."
"Don't you think so?"
"Treat her well."
"It could be."
"Of course, boss."
"Sleep with me."
"He canceled."
"Enjoy yourself."
"She wants it."
"Touch your gloves."
"Are you leaving too?"
"They grew up."
"Just a friend."
"I am untouchable."
"She's leaving me."
"She will be perfect."
"How many of you are there?"
"Old habits."
"Let them talk."
"Other witnesses?"
"No, guys."
"Can I come closer?"
"No gifts."
"I will leave tomorrow."
"Not fast enough."
"You have to go back."
"They will pay."
"She is full."
"Target approaching."
"Now to bed."
"Make an appointment."
"Come pick me up."
"In a few months."
"How to do this?"
"Not ours."
"Are we chasing them?"
"Not so soon."
"This way, come on."
"She adored him."
"I was serious."
"He wants you."
"Come see me."
"He is close."
"I will read it."
"Urine."
"Do you want to order?"
"A pretty girl."
"It was all there."
"Make them back off."
"So many things."
"No feelings."
"Where to find it?"
"You're fucked."
"At his mother's house."
"I slipped up."
"This is Paris."
"How do I know?"
"And the flowers?"
"She moves."
"Like yours."
"About three years."
"How much is it?"
"You guess right."
"We didn't know."
"Look at the sky."
"I wanted her."
"They are cool."
"They are cool."
"It's organic."
"Have faith."
"Good night, ladies."
"All joking aside."
"Winter is coming."
"Who is accompanying me?"
"We know that."
"Forgive me, master."
"No ice."
"Go upstairs."
"And your back?"
"Hi, dog."
"But you can."
"Here he goes."
"More rice?"
"Sorry, girls."
"Where is Jackson?"
"You were a volunteer."
"An old man."
"Secure the area."
"A big thing."
"In the reserve."
"Here they are."
"From the police?"
"I take that back."
"And those?"
"Out of reach."
"When are you coming back?"
"When are you coming back?"
"Aloud."
"Look at the device."
"Did you know what?"
"How is Ray?"
"Ecstasy."
"Don't move forward anymore."
"Hello anyway."
"Are you looking at him?"
"He listens to you."
"They will find it."
"How to recognize it?"
"Pray with me."
"I am sterile."
"Leave it here."
"Others are coming."
"Where is Kitty?"
"Just for me."
"Yes, excellent idea."
"Yeah, we know."
"Are they dating?"
"We are friends."
"Yeah, go ahead."
"We will protect you."
"Hey, look at this."
"We're going swimming."
"He still walks."
"Look at my hand."
"She looks like him."
"Do you want to negotiate?"
"It's tiny."
"Yeah, it happens."
"You had disappeared."
"This is Janet."
"Does he know?"
"In a box."
"I would be surprised."
"Good night, Tony."
"About two months."
"We have to go for it."
"That suits me."
"Make a decision."
"You're being unfair."
"In the mouth."
"We will win."
"This is my mother."
"Go home and rest."
"I am a physicist."
"And your homework?"
"You tell me."
"No history."
"Bridesmaid?"
"This is my son."
"Where is Don?"
"Take a deep breath."
"Big plans."
"It seems important."
"Please leave us."
"Of all of us."
"Take a step back."
"Credit card."
"What to do?"
"Finish your story."
"At your mother's."
"Okay, calm down."
"The smallest."
"It is hidden."
"Are you Japanese?"
"We have to start."
"This is Tim."
"A small detail."
"I have to win."
"Come see us."
"I know how to cook."
"I'd bet on it."
"I didn't know."
"An old friend."
"I will do better."
"Are you a volunteer?"
"But let's be honest."
"They canceled."
"What were they looking for?"
"They are in front."
"Let yourself go."
"It will be over."
"From a friend."
"Go ahead, hit."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"An easy target."
"It's going well."
"Everything is legal."
"What were you studying?"
"Mud."
"A beautiful smile."
"It's beautiful."
"Let me work."
"We will check."
"You will be perfect."
"What was he?"
"That would be cool."
"Not good enough."
"Give your hand."
"Where is Chase?"
"A brilliant man."
"Here is his file."
"I'm behind."
"No, we continue."
"A great moment."
"Goodbye, Jeff."
"I look at her."
"Put it here."
"Which one do you prefer?"
"This is Vic."
"Go play somewhere else."
"In my opinion."
"Take this one."
"Take this one."
"I would love to."
"Take off your clothes."
"I want to."
"This is Matthew."
"It started again."
"How much does it cost?"
"Lovely people."
"Everything is connected."
"No, we're waiting."
"To war."
"Like that, yes."
"I am unique."
"And the commander?"
"Are you insured?"
"Let's call the cops."
"You're an early riser."
"Are you interested?"
"No identity."
"What will we do?"
"I'm settling in."
"She is important."
"Come on, girls."
"Make up your mind quickly."
"She wants it."
"Only once."
"Got it, boss."
"When are you leaving again?"
"I am an actor."
"Where is Dawn?"
"He insists on it."
"Even stronger."
"Are you sincere?"
"Have a good trip?"
"For your mother."
"What do they say?"
"In his head."
"Good morning, Your Highness."
"To me, yes."
"Hey, beautiful."
"Hey, sweetie."
"You have to accept."
"Yes, you have to believe it."
"Stay with mom."
"Are you affected?"
"I laughed."
"You defend yourself."
"I am small."
"What do you hope for?"
"Put on your helmets."
"For peace."
"Honey, look at me."
"Is this wise?"
"Vodka."
"Who knows why."
"Let go of my arm."
"Are you back?"
"Where were they?"
"In the light."
"I'm warning her."
"You too."
"I'm full."
"It's Diane."
"Two more weeks."
"Go ahead, eat."
"How much does he want?"
"Who sends it?"
"Can you come up?"
"You're smart."
"You are smart."
"Check with him."
"This is Rebecca."
"I was delighted."
"Go to my house."
"I am a salesman."
"Do you understand why?"
"Who came in?"
"Rest now."
"He's still sleeping."
"When are you going out?"
"You would love it."
"Don't call anymore."
"Did you start again?"
"Where is Debbie?"
"Other what?"
"A second chance."
"I swore."
"But I try."
"I passed by."
"Is he plugged in?"
"Your phone rings."
"She's getting closer."
"It's his business."
"Who are we?"
"It was amazing."
"Not the hospital."
"You, with me."
"Where would we go?"
"And at his place?"
"Now stand up."
"Finish eating."
"Welcome to Mexico."
"You work well."
"Final stretch."
"Behind the line."
"Warn others."
"Here is our man."
"God loves you."
"Good evening, girls."
"Especially for me."
"A camera."
"Got it?"
"High-end."
"Rosebud?"
"Okay, girls."
"What does it contain?"
"What about alcohol?"
"This is Owen."
"Free will."
"Ready for what?"
"Here is your receipt."
"Keep the rest."
"Are you Jewish?"
"She is divorced."
"Ticket control."
"Call a doctor."
"Here is my answer."
"I can sing."
"Can we leave?"
"Not soon enough."
"She looks at you."
"Humor."
"Sorry, my boy."
"A handsome boy."
"What about golf?"
"This is Randy."
"She knew him."
"I'll drive you."
"A real man."
"In what order?"
"A real pro."
"Only one solution."
"And the prisoners?"
"About me?"
"Look, I understand."
"A private detective?"
"Clean up."
"Do you feel that?"
"Follow the light."
"Here, my dear."
"Look at this one."
"End of game."
"We are close."
"Daddy loves you."
"Keep it hidden."
"I am being watched."
"For whom then?"
"With someone?"
"I am reassured."
"In the rules."
"But I can."
"No address."
"You're back."
"You're back."
"Hopefully not."
"I am a therapist."
"They speak English."
"Call the doctor."
"Call the doctor."
"All right, that's it."
"At your post."
"I will accept."
"Who to call?"
"What are you up to?"
"What do you eat?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, good evening."
"Maybe soon."
"Go on without me."
"Even higher."
"This is Jan."
"She is attractive."
"I'm interested."
"God knows."
"Can you wait?"
"Here, taste this."
"I want to check."
"It was fun."
"They are inseparable."
"Call your brother."
"Hello, my pretty."
"Thank you, young lady."
"Not the time."
"I'm taking my leave."
"He's talking to you."
"A little beer?"
"Did you notice?"
"He is an engineer."
"The youngest."
"Welcome to the country."
"Forty-eight hours."
"I'm warning them."
"Do you want to dance?"
"And my daughters?"
"Good morning, Captain."
"We were together."
"Give me a sign."
"He adores you."
"It's priceless."
"He gets up."
"It impresses me."
"Mom is waiting for us."
"In the shower."
"I am a mother."
"We were talking about it."
"Exactly the same."
"Can we start?"
"He is German."
"And my money?"
"Are you real?"
"We can negotiate."
"Bring them up."
"Come on, let's do it."
"You're young."
"And here's why."
"And the passengers?"
"I'm stressed."
"Not like him."
"I'm choking."
"You are special."
"A new world."
"Are you excited?"
"But for you."
"So, be careful."
"Yes, Mom."
"In my apartment."
"Facing me."
"Good night, little one."
"And my share?"
"Tell him that."
"You were great."
"On the line."
"Sorry for you."
"Sorry, kids."
"Say a number."
"Do it, then."
"Congratulations, my friend."
"How are you in the back?"
"Start talking."
"Me and you."
"They are true."
"The battle begins."
"Hello, my little one."
"And your promise?"
"He is delighted."
"Who's calling you?"
"With your family."
"You are adorable."
"Yes, Grandpa."
"Raise your glasses."
"Hold your position."
"Do you remember?"
"And that was it?"
"Did you come in?"
"I promised."
"That's the deal."
"I was going to close."
"This is Mason."
"No wedding."
"Don't breathe."
"Good news?"
"It's poetic."
"Put on pants."
"This is my story."
"He was hungry."
"Where is Vincent?"
"Too late now."
"I like it."
"For school."
"Do you want to fly?"
"The little jerk."
"Say it now."
"And my sister?"
"For the cause."
"Just for info."
"There you go, guys."
"Where is God?"
"No more bullets."
"I love Halloween."
"Very, very strong."
"Where is Xena?"
"By the way, congratulations."
"You are tall."
"Ask your question."
"It's pure."
"Who was right?"
"You're stuck."
"Not by us."
"Silk."
"What to say to him?"
"I like it."
"I will pay for it."
"Tell me yes."
"Your turn will come."
"A few more steps."
"A matter of survival."
"Yeah, that too."
"No, take it."
"Yeah, one second."
"It seems obvious."
"Try again."
"Can I try again?"
"No luggage?"
"Take the stairs."
"Take my bag."
"Thank you for yesterday."
"Will you open the door?"
"Where is Piper?"
"This is Jess."
"You're cool."
"You, listen to me."
"He will protect you."
"She is sweet."
"Tilt your head."
"Yes, my daughter."
"Leave it there."
"And the reinforcements?"
"Who is he?"
"The master bedroom."
"Where is Patrick?"
"He is great."
"It's therapeutic."
"You don't notice anything?"
"It's bold."
"Is he gone?"
"God forgive me."
"In Utah."
"He adores me."
"You're mean."
"Let's introduce ourselves."
"I'm Molly."
"Or the opposite."
"I am enthusiastic."
"Now look at this."
"Who would want some?"
"Salad?"
"You will stay here."
"There, on the right."
"They are all asleep."
"It was exciting."
"Even closer."
"It will be necessary."
"We have some."
"On the hunt."
"For no reason."
"Change course."
"Captain's bridge."
"A spaceship?"
"No, I'm waiting."
"She better."
"He likes you."
"And the stones?"
"He bit."
"Are you thinking about it?"
"I liked her."
"The sat goes up."
"Sorry, little one."
"Where is Dylan?"
"Come on, my pretty."
"There are four of us."
"What are you writing?"
"Yes, well done."
"You are suspended."
"She will be happy."
"It will be the same."
"It was great."
"Bring them in."
"I was small."
"For justice."
"Watch over her."
"They are blue."
"As for me."
"It was obligatory."
"You're cute."
"Family affair."
"No more calls."
"A true marvel."
"But it will pass."
"I'm going to pick up."
"I'll guide you."
"What are we taking?"
"But she does."
"Hi, guys."
"You would do well."
"You would do well."
"Is she?"
"It's impeccable."
"It is impeccable."
"Why this argument?"
"He was happy."
"Do we know why?"
"Others don't."
"No more juice."
"Let's do this quickly."
"I always come back."
"In peace."
"A Friday night?"
"Come up with me."
"Go straight."
"Caused by what?"
"Well, here you are."
"How much is left?"
"I am amazing."
"Where, for example?"
"My little angel."
"Quite a program."
"This is Molly."
"You loved him."
"In the building."
"But here you are."
"We'll come."
"In this room."
"Am I forgiven?"
"Are you French?"
"Are you French?"
"We'll call you back."
"Where is Hassan?"
"Hurry up, then."
"Yes, with me."
"It was mutual."
"This is Rita."
"One of us."
"I would be careful."
"Well, it was."
"He speaks little."
"I will be kind."
"Where is father?"
"Where is Judy?"
"Mr. Prosecutor."
"Are you touching yourself?"
"Let go of my hand."
"Do you recognize her?"
"Where is Taylor?"
"Where is Cathy?"
"She was amazing."
"Where is Michelle?"
"Put them outside."
"Yes, it is."
"Where is McGee?"
"Work with me."
"This is Jessica."
"You tell him?"
"Let me continue."
"And the camera?"
"Take the children."
"You're coming, yes?"
"Can you elaborate?"
"Should I leave?"
"Check again."
"It fits perfectly."
"No, believe me."
"It's tiny."
"You could."
"Give me your bag."
"A good choice."
"I was ready."
"It looks promising."
"He is an actor."
"But why you?"
"You intrigue me."
"This is Aaron."
"And the hostages?"
"I loved you."
"Two and a half."
"You are single."
"What would I do?"
"You understand everything."
"Who pays you?"
"What is she?"
"Can you wait?"
"Do you know how to drive?"
"For weeks."
"Nice, at your place."
"They are wonderful."
"I noted."
"She wants to go home."
"You must act."
"Choose a card."
"Is she pretty?"
"This is true."
"My first time."
"Hello, my daughter."
"Where is Ruby?"
"It's German."
"You're strong."
"I'm going to taste it."
"Come, come, come."
"It's done."
"He is competent."
"Take this bag."
"Come on, rest."
"Come find me."
"Take command."
"Including you."
"Stay there."
"At the entrance."
"Well, good night."
"We should get started."
"Do you know us?"
"Call me tomorrow."
"Am I being punished?"
"Put it here."
"Why start now?"
"You are excused."
"A little baby."
"Need no one."
"Don't be."
"I will protect her."
"Free your mind."
"We should move."
"That would be wonderful."
"Would that suit you?"
"Please stay on hold."
"As much as me."
"They are still searching."
"Invent something."
"What about my rights?"
"I continued."
"Once again."
"Why these screams?"
"The usual place."
"How does it end?"
"Go back."
"But that, yes."
"I know that."
"I'll take it."
"Would it be him?"
"They were waiting for me."
"It would seem so."
"What's going on?"
"And others."
"Let's get ready."
"And we continue."
"Tell me who."
"This is Neil."
"Do you want to count?"
"I guess so."
"Are you a believer?"
"At six o'clock."
"Go ahead, gentlemen."
"Do you admit it?"
"My little baby."
"Everything must go."
"Thanks in advance."
"Are you coming to see?"
"In a hotel."
"Give the alert."
"It's early."
"She was looking for you."
"Let her do it."
"You have chosen."
"I was good."
"And here it is."
"You have to learn."
"A happy ending."
"Not long."
"What do you smell?"
"This is my opinion."
"This is my office."
"My phone rings."
"Shall we go home together?"
"No movement."
"No flowers."
"So many things."
"Do you understand me?"
"They knew it."
"What was she saying?"
"Where to find it?"
"Stay on course."
"I promise you."
"Are you coming for dinner?"
"I will follow you."
"It was deliberate."
"Well done, Captain."
"They have changed."
"Sorry, sweetie."
"Here comes the cavalry."
"I just..."
"It was close."
"No story."
"No, my heart."
"She is friendly."
"It scares me."
"A great guy."
"A great guy."
"No arrangement."
"I would talk to him."
"They will get there."
"You could wait."
"It's electric."
"Good night, Captain."
"It's them."
"Please wait here."
"I have evolved."
"Guys, come on."
"Rest in peace."
"Go back to class."
"I'm going fishing."
"A nice thing."
"Me, of course."
"Let me see this."
"Were you following me?"
"Have a coffee."
"I have to cancel."
"It was great."
"What is it?"
"They were inseparable."
"And the hotel?"
"Keep dreaming."
"And Merry Christmas."
"Like mine."
"For how many nights?"
"Might as well get it over with."
"Not so long ago."
"I do everything."
"God loves you."
"Oh, good idea."
"You think so?"
"Stand guard."
"And you with it."
"Come up there."
"The usual stuff."
"Stay home."
"Let's start from scratch."
"You were great."
"She talks too much."
"You are brave."
"I should stay."
"What would happen?"
"In the river."
"I'll get rid of you."
"I'm just checking."
"Here, take it."
"Did you pay?"
"Come on, come dance."
"In twenty minutes."
"We are delighted."
"I wanted to change."
"Can I come down?"
"I was going to call."
"He is training."
"When is he leaving?"
"The target is approaching."
"In what genre?"
"Hard left."
"Clear the deck."
"She is terrifying."
"Check it out for yourself."
"Make a decision."
"Be yourself."
"Happy birthday, Mom."
"How do you get home?"
"They are rare."
"I will explain."
"In the world."
"I was looking at you."
"So you know."
"You ask?"
"This is Ed."
"Less than that."
"Watch over him."
"Did he sign?"
"Are you interested in her?"
"What would you say?"
"This is Brad."
"Did you decide?"
"Yes, my baby."
"Take your day."
"And five."
"Do you promise?"
"They can't."
"Are you waking up?"
"Why at my place?"
"To what question?"
"Who would believe it?"
"You don't know?"
"What are you studying?"
"It doesn't work."
"You first."
"Not maybe."
"Everything is great."
"God bless them."
"What will you have?"
"I know how to dance."
"Do I really have to?"
"I adapt."
"She is old."
"Mom, let it go."
"No parents."
"I'm fucked."
"Security reasons."
"Where is Spencer?"
"And have a good trip."
"I'll take you."
"And us with it."
"He will find her."
"I am naked."
"Who knows her?"
"Same for me."
"But with whom?"
"Straight ahead."
"Dad, listen to me."
"Are you serious?"
"Do you know her?"
"How are you, little one?"
"Safe and sound."
"God bless us."
"Can you speed up?"
"I'm wet."
"She can wait."
"We have to end this."
"And your friend?"
"And your friend?"
"You are good."
"What will we see?"
"Together forever."
"A hold-up?"
"What do you hope for?"
"A lot, actually."
"We live together."
"Do you know him?"
"Take off your glasses."
"We must hold on."
"Please."
"Do you want to go out?"
"Police officer."
"Will you do that?"
"Are you sitting down?"
"And your work?"
"She knows nothing."
"I ask you."
"We danced."
"No keys."
"And the guards?"
"I will teach him."
"I am delighted."
"And the meeting?"
"I'll take that off."
"Go ahead, Garcia."
"Piece by piece."
"No, it was fine."
"I was out."
"It was exceptional."
"You are a minor."
"I'm looking for you."
"What other things?"
"Everything was normal."
"Just a little one."
"You should try it."
"Lots of water."
"Keep turning."
"So, let's see."
"I work."
"You deserve it."
"In a trunk."
"We must begin."
"From the outside."
"You are forgiven."
"She was delighted."
"Where is Zack?"
"He is mortal."
"Look at the screen."
"Okay, hi."
"Any other comments?"
"How would you do it?"
"Good morning, Your Majesty."
"Would you like to play?"
"From home."
"You have to pay."
"See him."
"What was he looking for?"
"I see, sir."
"Turn it up."
"I'm telling the truth."
"Yes, it's coming."
"I sell them."
"Of himself."
"Can you sing?"
"It means a lot."
"It's going to cut."
"She has to eat."
"Pull up your pants."
"Excuse me, man."
"This is Ali."
"How can I tell you?"
"Always the same."
"Here, right here."
"All but one."
"Yes, very beautiful."
"Look at this guy."
"Look at this guy."
"Go further."
"Do you believe it?"
"He is sublime."
"I will do it."
"Talk to him, you."
"Very good, really."
"Each of us."
"She is haunted."
"No baby."
"Nothing so far."
"Do you take any?"
"He was brilliant."
"No explanation."
"And that noise?"
"Like every year."
"Find one."
"I am an artist."
"Come, my friend."
"I am Eric."
"This one too."
"Call the doctor."
"You too, darling."
"That was clever."
"Not you, darling."
"Go without me."
"It's stimulating."
"Oh, yes, thank you."
"Go play somewhere else."
"It excites him."
"That very one."
"Drink your milk."
"We apologize."
"Just in case."
"Purpose of the stay?"
"Prosecutor's Office."
"Good evening, friends."
"Do you like it?"
"Yes to what?"
"What was she?"
"Before and after."
"I believe so."
"Not too tight?"
"In the earth."
"And my hair?"
"In Queens."
"For my own good?"
"It will do."
"And thank you again."
"Touch wood."
"Say your price."
"All right, go ahead."
"It's outside."
"Here's a hint."
"Justice will be done."
"They will see."
"I gave in."
"Good night, princess."
"For my people."
"Sorry, Your Honor."
"Everything looks the same."
"A hot chocolate."
"Who do I call?"
"We were friends."
"I would have it."
"Who is Rita?"
"This is Barney."
"One hundred percent."
"Where is Noah?"
"Yes, I will come."
"Let's do this right."
"Of the truth."
"He assured."
"No ball."
"I travel light."
"We make do."
"So, this audition?"
"Sing for me."
"Fishing."
"Are you an artist?"
"I want to go up."
"A new car?"
"Bye, see you tomorrow."
"We'll do that."
"Behind this door."
"I'm waiting here."
"A real pro."
"We were in love."
"He was cool."
"Just a few days."
"Go home."
"I got it."
"Bring the car."
"Where is Brad?"
"I am awake."
"I am expected."
"When are you arriving?"
"It's cultural."
"You're an early riser."
"Oh, my man."
"Let's go talk to them."
"Take your torches."
"Where do I live?"
"She says that?"
"Just a moment, Captain."
"Come on, smile."
"He knows us."
"I'll call you."
"Easy on that."
"I'll see you again."
"But not there."
"More than this."
"See you later, Dad."
"Go over it."
"Don't think."
"Call the block."
"I am white."
"We understood."
"Come on, take it."
"Here, a present."
"They have to."
"Hey, that's enough."
"Can I, Mom?"
"Keep up the good work."
"She accompanies me."
"You should know."
"Better than before."
"I hear that."
"Which boyfriend?"
"In Connecticut."
"I have to write."
"What are you making?"
"What are you doing?"
"How much is it worth?"
"We worked together."
"Yes, Your Excellency."
"Yes, let's talk about it."
"Here's the deal."
"Here's the deal."
"Let's go to the movies."
"I moved forward."
"And a friend."
"Get that out of my way."
"Here are my conditions."
"The storm is coming."
"Look who's coming."
"Look who's coming."
"It's poisoned."
"Dress well."
"Are you open?"
"This is different."
"What were you looking for?"
"What, exactly?"
"Take your car."
"This is Dennis."
"But be careful."
"He is a musician."
"How many horses?"
"How many survivors?"
"You are engaged."
"Luck turns."
"It all fits together."
"A little kiss."
"We rest."
"I was innocent."
"And I sympathize."
"Need a vacation?"
"Ready to launch."
"They are rich."
"This is Spencer."
"What about medications?"
"You are responsible."
"Put down that phone."
"I am a teacher."
"Good morning, Mr. Bond."
"Go tell them."
"Are you a pilot?"
"All in place."
"A nice guy."
"Do you live together?"
"Thank you for coming."
"You are tough."
"Call back later."
"But listen to this."
"What a beautiful baby."
"First of all."
"Acid."
"And my baby?"
"Here is your gift."
"You have to sign."
"Among others."
"For my family."
"It was mind-blowing."
"Are you going to stay?"
"A little pick-me-up?"
"Have a drink."
"Your little girl?"
"Kiss me again."
"Are you okay?"
"Hey, pretty."
"Look at this man."
"I can guess."
"Not for me anymore."
"Are you affected?"
"I'm the same."
"With milk."
"Well, yeah."
"Cut the rope."
"And his hair?"
"DNA?"
"Don't sing."
"Are you asleep already?"
"Keep eating."
"Hangover?"
"The Twilight Zone."
"Where is Janet?"
"Who has some?"
"Good night, Jim."
"Where is Chloe?"
"Look at me now."
"I want it."
"Except no."
"Take your time."
"A little kiss?"
"He is left-handed."
"She despises me."
"Without knowing it."
"It looks like you."
"Ron is right."
"Let them try."
"Nothing planned."
"And our children?"
"This is Gabriel."
"Great art."
"The cavalry is coming."
"Wait, you'll see."
"And that smell?"
"Raise your hand."
"I will act."
"Where is Rita?"
"The most important."
"For the day."
"He turned."
"Who are we waiting for?"
"They are happy."
"Nothing official."
"Where is Leo?"
"Turkey."
"Wait for the beep."
"I can breathe."
"Take the stairs."
"Are there many of you?"
"He is bald."
"How many rooms?"
"But they know."
"Do you recognize me?"
"You pay attention."
"A real delight."
"God is everywhere."
"Were you pretending?"
"A little drop?"
"Should I repeat?"
"Do you feel anything?"
"He is impressive."
"Where is Sofia?"
"Are you hiding?"
"The shields hold."
"In the alley."
"You will see her."
"She was mean."
"I will survive."
"No distractions."
"You two, outside."
"The white rabbit."
"I am a screenwriter."
"Like crystal."
"The wind is blowing."
"Gather your men."
"Do yourself a favor."
"And his cell phone?"
"Yes, Mr. Shaw."
"Right from the start."
"And your friends?"
"It belongs to you."
"Bring some wine."
"Oh, let's see."
"It's okay."
"House was right."
"How are you, kid?"
"Should I undress?"
"Is it done?"
"Finally, here you are."
"Helping people."
"Who are you protecting?"
"Welcome to Chicago."
"Who disappeared?"
"Security check."
"It's nobody's business."
"Not very good."
"Step by step."
"Bring them in."
"A bell rings."
"Go take a shower."
"Take off your pants."
"In which city?"
"This is Ian."
"No, never again."
"Did you talk?"
"This is Cole."
"What about the Jedi?"
"Make me proud."
"Here is an example."
"Clean all that up."
"Where is Jo?"
"Keep the rhythm."
"And the cat?"
"Yes, you know."
"A few more."
"He works late."
"No more electricity."
"So, last night?"
"Where is Greg?"
"I got fat."
"No, keep it."
"They grow up fast."
"Winter is coming."
"Where is Ethan?"
"Where are they going?"
"Take a shower."
"Do it right."
"I stayed."
"Then nothing."
"And his son?"
"You're in it."
"Are you spying on us?"
"Oh, go ahead."
"And the keys?"
"I am Caesar."
"You will be rewarded."
"The real world?"
"But believe me."
"We are touched."
"Ready to go home?"
"What is he waiting for?"
"What is he waiting for?"
"The secret services?"
"Good luck, Lieutenant."
"I'm going to drink."
"Let's go this way."
"I'm going to leave."
"Make peace."
"Oh, yes."
"And the photo?"
"Hey, buddy."
"Luckily for us."
"It haunts me."
"What are they saying?"
"You're smart."
"You will pay."
"She was cool."
"The weather was nice."
"You, over there."
"Open the box."
"They will try."
"Where is Jess?"
"The day arrives."
"He was black."
"She was married."
"She disappeared."
"Are you coming home already?"
"That seems correct."
"How is Ben?"
"I wanted to see."
"Keep this for me."
"No point in trying."
"For the three of us."
"Do it again."
"Where is Locke?"
"A very small one."
"Think of her."
"Protect and serve."
"I could."
"Read this to me."
"Do you know how to drive?"
"I am perfect."
"Do your thing."
"Don't back down."
"Very well, Lieutenant."
"It was open."
"You don't want to?"
"For three days."
"I am indestructible."
"Okay, kids."
"But who counts?"
"On my honor."
"Find the girl."
"What else?"
"With a smile."
"We are adults."
"What about the FBI?"
"You're out."
"You are sublime."
"Stand up, my boy."
"Pull down your pants."
"They gave up."
"Yes, I must."
"Yes and yes."
"Go ahead, laugh."
"Here are your keys."
"They were kind."
"And the ball?"
"Sorry about what?"
"They are fresh."
"Just a little one."
"Where is Gordon?"
"He is breathing well."
"Drink your glass."
"In the sky."
"Does she turn you on?"
"In the nape of the neck."
"Empty your bag."
"Call the FBI."
"You look different."
"Keep smiling."
"I can succeed."
"Yeah, I can."
"And then this."
"They will get you."
"Have a cookie."
"How do we get down?"
"Who wants to come?"
"What exactly?"
"Are they looking for me?"
"Calm down now."
"Calm down now."
"During the week."
"He wants to leave."
"A whole life."
"For my business."
"Are you Russian?"
"Prepare for the jump."
"In the rain."
"That explains everything."
"Take your phone."
"She's great."
"Are you high?"
"For his birthday."
"There are five of us."
"Spring is coming."
"Act as if."
"Not you, him."
"Are you a psychiatrist?"
"For an hour."
"Let me explain."
"I will survive it."
"Bring him to us."
"The helicopter is coming."
"We understood."
"With what money?"
"Lucky for you."
"Lucky for you."
"I wrote."
"Enough questions."
"We were right."
"And a beer."
"Where were they?"
"I'll see about that."
"He guessed."
"It was serious."
"I am a banker."
"Why did you accept?"
"How much do you owe?"
"Nor for me."
"Hold the door."
"Not in person."
"We're going to stay."
"I resisted."
"I knew it."
"Where are we now?"
"Crew Commander."
"Goodbye, Tim."
"You like me."
"Guard the door."
"He calls her."
"Yes, I admit it."
"Come get us."
"No proof."
"Pick up your things."
"Is she conscious?"
"The boat is arriving."
"With you, yes."
"When am I leaving?"
"Describe it to me."
"Good evening, my angel."
"A good package."
"We'll take you back."
"Who does it?"
"What was he wearing?"
"And your first name?"
"One minute, sir."
"What do you understand?"
"Take this one."
"Only by reputation."
"Look at my face."
"You can let go."
"He was strong."
"You have to wait."
"Do you play it?"
"You must answer."
"We'll be back soon."
"No jokes."
"Is Tony here?"
"What are you risking?"
"And the sound?"
"Not anytime soon."
"This is Marco."
"Here's the ball."
"I finally understand."
"Here is my question."
"In the cockpit."
"Can I open?"
"He is remarkable."
"You loved me."
"On the first floor."
"Let me listen."
"It's modern."
"I order it."
"Is it safe?"
"She is close."
"Well done, soldier."
"Now, off to bed."
"Just one night."
"I confirm it."
"I see, thank you."
"And the last one."
"For three weeks."
"Look, you see?"
"I am invited."
"Wait for orders."
"Do you want to walk?"
"Here is your mother."
"Are we still playing?"
"Here we go."
"Tomorrow at noon."
"Indeed, madam."
"Are you listening to me?"
"No head."
"Oh yeah, that."
"I'm hanging up now."
"In his pocket."
"I'll take him."
"Where is Cora?"
"No, I'll go."
"Take it upon yourself."
"It is gigantic."
"Bring them here."
"You're great."
"I am being followed."
"She was gifted."
"This guy?"
"It's fun."
"Imagine the scene."
"She obsesses me."
"It's white."
"It will pass."
"Just as a precaution."
"Are we clear?"
"In ten years."
"One more game."
"More power."
"Take your coat."
"So, do you like it?"
"He wants to go out."
"We are in love."
"Close the curtains."
"Let's go rest."
"A beautiful story."
"Oh, come here."
"You were friends?"
"Put them there."
"Go back to bed."
"And the driver?"
"Right at the end."
"Who would it be?"
"And you, old man?"
"She is interesting."
"It will come back to you."
"I won't do it again."
"Like a dream."
"Three, actually."
"And his business?"
"Shall we call him?"
"Are you fighting?"
"The dog barks."
"I was a lawyer."
"No bullets."
"No plate."
"How to get there?"
"On your signal."
"Where is Logan?"
"Say something."
"I'm coming home tomorrow."
"Look at these pictures."
"No guards."
"He speaks Russian."
"Where is Ron?"
"With my compliments."
"Goodbye, son."
"Hey, you two."
"Spin it."
"Part-time."
"No need to answer."
"She's having fun."
"She knows you."
"No, I was working."
"My dear child."
"And our luggage?"
"Were you expecting us?"
"The Grand Canyon."
"For you, yes."
"Goodbye, Nick."
"A little, yes."
"I'm chasing him."
"No electricity."
"And a drink?"
"Go ahead, play."
"Thank you, that's enough."
"She will recover."
"Look up there."
"Like a brother."
"Come upstairs."
"No white."
"What do you decide?"
"She is French."
"Squirrel?"
"It makes me tired."
"You, this way."
"And these?"
"Keep your spirits up."
"I'll go see."
"Mayor's office."
"For the night."
"And four."
"This has to change."
"Take the other one."
"This is Vince."
"Nor mine."
"Who do I see?"
"Not like before."
"Better than you."
"So from whom?"
"Go join her."
"You must live."
"Hang up the phone."
"Is it essential?"
"The speaker."
"This is Tina."
"How can I tell you?"
"Where does he live?"
"Like a girl."
"This is Christopher."
"Okay, big guy."
"Who will do it?"
"So, call me."
"In this car."
"Goodbye, Tony."
"Make the call."
"Make the call."
"You're soaked."
"Almost four years."
"I'm coming home late."
"The DNA matches."
"It's related."
"They are excellent."
"She is calm."
"A good cop."
"Take off your panties."
"Yes, it exists."
"It opens."
"Are you coming home soon?"
"Yes, I bet."
"Yes, very clear."
"No cell phone."
"We start now."
"And the revolver?"
"It's Damon."
"Where is Norman?"
"Drink a little."
"And your car?"
"Give me your arm."
"And respect?"
"This is Monica."
"What did you believe?"
"Sorry, sweetie."
"I can ask."
"Not much longer."
"We believe you."
"No, I'm managing."
"We catch up with them."
"You were gone."
"You'll be great."
"Not his type."
"She'll manage."
"He greets you."
"He greets you."
"Just a man."
"Don't look any further."
"Easy, friend."
"A new house?"
"I'm taking a big risk."
"She got fat."
"Consider yourself lucky."
"I will cooperate."
"No scene."
"All that what?"
"Give your price."
"Thank you, my brothers."
"In your office."
"I lived here."
"There are six of them."
"Do you play it?"
"Where is Phoebe?"
"This is Dylan."
"As far as I know."
"Very good, thank you."
"No contract."
"This is Benjamin."
"They are big."
"Zoom in."
"Get up, come on."
"On Earth."
"All present, sir."
"And the result?"
"Are you new?"
"We take them."
"My father is coming."
"Plan B?"
"What could be better?"
"And the address?"
"Do you want to visit?"
"Twenty-eight years old."
"The great shape."
"And your hair?"
"You will get better."
"It's special."
"Take his statement."
"Call the switchboard."
"I have to wait."
"You started."
"We sit down."
"Where is Mickey?"
"The blue bird."
"They know us."
"I will pay for everything."
"Sir is served."
"Say something else."
"Excuse me, General."
"For a month."
"Shall I tell you?"
"Bring her in."
"He is lucky."
"To see you."
"Reach out."
"It will be cool."
"I went down."
"Twenty-three years old."
"Is that enough?"
"But you don't."
"Are you abandoning us?"
"Yes, you see?"
"I understand."
"I won't come."
"This is Jennifer."
"We will go together."
"He is an accountant."
"Come and get them."
"Yes, it matters."
"Shall we drop you off?"
"It makes sense."
"But what about you?"
"You will learn."
"I knew them."
"Do you feel it?"
"They were in love."
"Give the money."
"You should accept."
"No operation."
"Vehicle documents."
"Let him live."
"You arrive early."
"Not cool, man."
"Thank you very much, thank you."
"It's sentimental."
"It got out of hand."
"How is Karen?"
"It is green."
"But not them."
"She is asleep."
"He was amazing."
"Come on, children."
"To whom then?"
"Who lives there?"
"Where is it going?"
"Very well, Sergeant."
"Just a picture."
"Do you miss them?"
"Are you gone?"
"Do you really think so?"
"All expenses paid."
"Whose?"
"Could you come?"
"Are you doing it again?"
"It would be easy."
"In what context?"
"I'll bring her back."
"Take your medicine."
"And with what?"
"Now get out of here."
"Do you know him?"
"All the money."
"Just in case."
"He helps me."
"Look at my mouth."
"Just dinner."
"No hope."
"What did you expect?"
"Come on, take it."
"Until morning."
"Same for him."
"You seem happy."
"Make some noise."
"In the sea?"
"You are everywhere."
"I have to finish."
"Pure."
"It's borderline."
"I didn't think so."
"But let's be clear."
"Like yours."
"Where is Carrie?"
"Put on your helmet."
"A missing person."
"You are lucky."
"You are lucky."
"We move."
"Are you coming home?"
"And you."
"Look at this view."
"You had everything."
"Not to that."
"How much will that be?"
"And the list?"
"During the war."
"Give them to him."
"Put it in."
"But look at me."
"There, it will be fine."
"A great classic."
"Are you interested?"
"Are you interested?"
"Friendly advice."
"He is locked up."
"She wants to leave."
"Let's make a bet."
"Where is Barry?"
"There are five of them."
"Will you be home late?"
"Are you watching this?"
"Let them out."
"How much does he want?"
"On the rocks?"
"Oh, yes."
"He's harassing me."
"Not very original."
"On the radio."
"Sorry, big guy."
"Now rest."
"Have fun."
"This is Jean."
"They'll get over it."
"I will fix it."
"What are you?"
"What did you think?"
"With my money."
"For insurance."
"We must win."
"This is Jenna."
"I am independent."
"I am independent."
"I am capable."
"And this glass?"
"Where is Ross?"
"For you, Mom."
"Where is Sally?"
"Take pictures."
"Necessity is the law."
"Forgot something?"
"Where is Robin?"
"Where is Heather?"
"Do you like them?"
"Watch the movie."
"On my side."
"I am wise."
"Come on, friend."
"Is she beautiful?"
"Turn on the lights."
"Later, then."
"It never works."
"Not a person."
"Where is Joseph?"
"Are you getting up?"
"I am black."
"Good evening, gentlemen."
"Have a coffee."
"This will be interesting."
"For a year."
"I am a magician."
"Moment of truth."
"Where is Liam?"
"He can walk."
"Let her finish."
"In the fields."
"I vote yes."
"And the ring?"
"The full moon."
"He will be back soon."
"It will protect you."
"He will explain to you."
"And the birds?"
"At the last moment."
"Take your bag."
"Come on, my love."
"I was terrified."
"You will find."
"Not a penny."
"Look at us now."
"So, this party?"
"And fries."
"It was over."
"In perfect condition."
"Keep in touch."
"This is my brother."
"All for one."
"Can you hear me?"
"Keep filming."
"Show your cards."
"We are making good progress."
"From the company?"
"Just be careful."
"Now, over to you."
"It changes us."
"For your father."
"Everything is planned."
"I desire you."
"Bodyguard?"
"You will meet him."
"Make sure of it."
"Good night, Ben."
"I want to go back."
"Come see here."
"A whiskey and soda."
"Nice work, gentlemen."
"Here are two."
"He is magical."
"Who do you see?"
"I can do that."
"Do you want to try?"
"All week."
"I wear it."
"Not now, no."
"Hey, look at this."
"He found it."
"We are innocent."
"Here is the car."
"Get in the car."
"He must come."
"Not at his place."
"He heard."
"Good evening, Mr. Bond."
"Do you excuse us?"
"Go further."
"Oh, that'll be fine."
"Good times."
"They are unique."
"Your way."
"Go downstairs."
"Where is Diego?"
"We're going camping."
"Go with her."
"I will live."
"How would I say?"
"So, very good."
"Now we talk."
"I'm Carrie."
"She will live."
"Hello, my love."
"In the neighborhood."
"He is questioned."
"What will they do?"
"Are you a priest?"
"You were pregnant."
"Black and white."
"Where was he?"
"Here is the kitchen."
"A car is approaching."
"She is exceptional."
"I recommend it."
"Look at that face."
"Lights out."
"We will ask."
"Well, good luck."
"Let's start from there."
"Do you feel them?"
"You can come back."
"You can come back."
"All right, ladies."
"Call off your men."
"Your usual table?"
"Everything will end well."
"His name, already?"
"I am a patriot."
"Come on, get up."
"Here is the map."
"I am a taxi driver."
"Will you be staying for a long time?"
"A submarine?"
"This is Samantha."
"Yes, in Paris."
"This is Hal."
"No radio."
"Your real name."
"With my daughter."
"Oh, calm down."
"But be careful."
"It was bound to happen."
"We're coming back."
"She kisses him."
"Wait for us here."
"Wait for us here."
"We drank."
"Hold the door."
"My God, why?"
"You disobeyed."
"Well done, Bob."
"On the leg."
"Think about yourself."
"And you, yes?"
"I'll transfer you."
"I'll be honest."
"Who is this?"
"Yes, a few."
"At the very beginning."
"Do you see her?"
"Clear your mind."
"No, not for long."
"Exhibit."
"Are we okay?"
"Keep digging."
"Close the door."
"What kind?"
"Do you know any?"
"Should I guess?"
"Have you checked?"
"Two for me."
"Like friends."
"It's young."
"I have to testify."
"For two months."
"Here is the mail."
"Good night, Colonel."
"I would have understood."
"How could he?"
"And for the gentleman?"
"We are working on it."
"He protects us."
"Don't slow down."
"Don't slow down."
"You are sexy."
"You are a journalist."
"Here is my proposal."
"Open the doors."
"Iced tea?"
"Well, I hope so."
"Thank you, have a nice day."
"Do you want some?"
"Who would do it?"
"Have you looked?"
"We'll see."
"I am a producer."
"Are you waiting for it?"
"Take this one."
"In your bed."
"And you know?"
"A beautiful girl."
"Right, boss?"
"I am a Muslim."
"At the opera."
"Are you letting me go?"
"Put on your pants."
"For your husband."
"Give it a try."
"It has evolved."
"I was calling you."
"Trust me."
"Cancel this order."
"Don't breathe anymore."
"They want you."
"But for you."
"Has she been drinking?"
"And take this."
"A raccoon."
"Just a few weeks."
"It's relaxing."
"Yes, like what?"
"She had everything."
"Let's get to work then."
"Under what name?"
"Can I stay?"
"I want to walk."
"It's erased."
"This is Carol."
"In the mirror."
"It's tomorrow."
"He can."
"I gave."
"How many cards?"
"He is sick."
"It escapes us."
"You could."
"Look at the light."
"I can learn."
"You will find it."
"We like it."
"I'm taking care of myself."
"He is indestructible."
"I would have thought."
"We're working here."
"Where is Chandler?"
"Who will believe you?"
"And the report?"
"No, calm down."
"Put him outside."
"They were looking for you."
"Given the circumstances."
"You're mean."
"I will introduce you."
"In ten days."
"I'll wait for you."
"Heading north."
"Please step aside."
"They were everywhere."
"I am a pastor."
"Accused, stand up."
"But now, yes."
"So, get ready."
"Are you going to sing?"
"She asks you."
"They loved each other."
"And the second?"
"And the university?"
"And the judge?"
"I'll get it back."
"I like them."
"Everything depends on it."
"And these people?"
"Good evening, sir."
"If he survives."
"Yes, very pretty."
"I do it."
"Look who's talking."
"It speaks to me."
"Are you a student?"
"Will that be enough?"
"Tell me where."
"When will you know?"
"One of the two."
"Wait for the thing."
"Have you tried?"
"It's Buffy."
"Are you a virgin?"
"Are you a virgin?"
"Well, let's see."
"He wanted it."
"Who do you love?"
"Out of stock."
"Where is Helen?"
"She is an adult."
"Goodbye, Patrick."
"From school."
"It exploded."
"Can we order?"
"Thanks to this."
"Yes, old man."
"Until yesterday."
"How many employees?"
"A priori, yes."
"I love to travel."
"Now kiss me."
"Roger that, Houston."
"This is Trevor."
"Who are we?"
"So, do you accept?"
"Are you selling them?"
"Activate the shield."
"You are wise."
"It's okay here."
"Let's find something else."
"Yes, it helps."
"They are white."
"She is delighted."
"Yes, mine."
"It's over."
"Peace on earth."
"What are you preparing?"
"Can you?"
"Look at me, Mom."
"Switch to impulse."
"Two hundred thousand."
"Safety first."
"Say a number."
"Where is Reed?"
"We follow her."
"Far from me."
"And the shoes?"
"Let's see what happens next."
"Stay alert."
"It was red."
"Twenty-six years old."
"Can't you hear anything?"
"Not in time."
"When it works."
"They get married."
"Aim for the head."
"He loves them."
"What are you doing?"
"It's encrypted."
"Leave here."
"Can he come?"
"Safety measure."
"To myself."
"From myself."
"There you go, my dear."
"They belong to me."
"Come here, son."
"We live here."
"He was great."
"Well, let's see."
"This big."
"When does it get hot?"
"Turn up the volume."
"Go first."
"Yeah, you too."
"That sounds great."
"Heroin."
"He will try."
"Take the next one."
"Physically, I'm fine."
"Here is my hand."
"I'm going to finish."
"Want to participate?"
"Why are you calling?"
"Why are you calling?"
"A storm is approaching."
"They see us."
"Which one do you want?"
"Madam, are you okay?"
"She forgot."
"All right, come on."
"I cancel everything."
"Where is Marcus?"
"Where is Booth?"
"In a dream."
"Really very beautiful."
"Of course, son."
"And you, Captain?"
"This is Marty."
"She screamed."
"In Michigan."
"First new message."
"Thank you very much, really."
"This is Barbara."
"Two, one, five."
"Here is the door."
"So, this match?"
"I am neutral."
"No cameras."
"Keep the money."
"Hello, Mom."
"My favorite place."
"It's on."
"She is a writer."
"I have to disappear."
"You're done."
"Alright, cool."
"You have disappeared."
"Here, listen to this."
"I'll be fine."
"Like a father."
"A hell of a package."
"What are you singing?"
"Most often."
"I'm going to have dinner."
"You will find her."
"No, come here."
"No, come here."
"Take up arms."
"To protect yourself."
"Look at his neck."
"Where is Francis?"
"Brain tumor."
"This is Marge."
"No, thank you very much."
"Have you been drinking?"
"Have you been drinking?"
"Are you talking to each other?"
"Like my wife."
"Just a tip."
"He was telling the truth."
"This is Ned."
"Do this quickly."
"He's looking for us."
"They talk to us."
"Does this happen to you?"
"I will go myself."
"You are adults."
"In the cellar."
"Remove your hand."
"We all change."
"The perfect woman."
"You should understand."
"Look at yourself now."
"Keep it here."
"Matter of minutes."
"Look at this carefully."
"You were fantastic."
"Yes, my darling."
"Not an accident."
"This is Rory."
"Oh, I love it."
"I am Scottish."
"She will listen to me."
"And the toilets?"
"Do you want to have dinner?"
"And these?"
"No kiss?"
"This is Stan."
"You two, come on."
"My real mother."
"And the radio?"
"Two for you."
"Not much."
"She smiled."
"She is normal."
"How is Bobby?"
"Look at this."
"I helped."
"How many are there?"
"This is Meredith."
"I am Spartacus."
"People love it."
"Is it safe?"
"Let's all go."
"Me, this way."
"How many guards?"
"Out of gas."
"Go ahead, say it."
"In three hours."
"Nothing in particular."
"It's blocked."
"It's getting better."
"It was touching."
"On the top floor."
"Go home and rest."
"She is diabetic."
"What's missing?"
"Change your tone."
"You're cute."
"No, you, listen."
"She dreams about it."
"Talk to whom?"
"It is interesting."
"Where is Robbie?"
"It was anonymous."
"Well done, kid."
"This is Al."
"Are you interested?"
"Thank you for stopping by."
"It's narrow."
"Here is the answer."
"I'm Amy."
"I am known."
"Several, in fact."
"God knows how."
"Very well, Your Majesty."
"Keep breathing."
"Play the video."
"I would be outside."
"Easy, man."
"How was she?"
"Let's play cards."
"You are finished."
"Of course, what?"
"Just you."
"Everything is cleaned."
"Let me live."
"Let him come."
"I'm decided."
"Give your position."
"And the watch?"
"Go right."
"She is fabulous."
"One more step."
"Keep moving."
"And the investigation?"
"Only in the morning."
"In my pants."
"He is marked."
"A remarkable woman."
"Put on your hat."
"Do you really think so?"
"Let's make a deal."
"We'll talk again."
"Are you in love?"
"I want to pay."
"Take off your top."
"Can you call back?"
"Everything was ready."
"We really appreciate it."
"Please remain calm."
"No, I guess."
"Very late."
"My big boy."
"Could you repeat that?"
"Go ahead, old man."
"Less fees."
"And the show?"
"Fill out the form."
"This is Jeremy."
"That would be lovely."
"And the good one?"
"Whoever you want."
"Are you leaving me?"
"Take this money."
"The handsome guy."
"Four more."
"Yes, you know."
"In my cabin."
"You, this way."
"No call."
"Nobody changes."
"What were you looking for?"
"I have to go up."
"Yeah, you're welcome."
"Open the hood."
"The other one, now."
"Who called?"
"Moving target."
"And your book?"
"Are you Jewish?"
"You should come by."
"Where is Lou?"
"Take the rope."
"There it is, it's coming."
"You're an early riser."
"Finish your plate."
"In three minutes."
"Where is Denise?"
"Put down your glass."
"She is a redhead."
"Where is Kenny?"
"We'll catch up with you."
"For love."
"Come here, little one."
"That's a long way off."
"Yeah, you bet."
"Of course, that's it."
"I was good."
"Are you coming back?"
"My only friend."
"She adores you."
"Call me Bob."
"A smart little guy."
"It will be fine."
"I will heal."
"What were you waiting for?"
"No fans?"
"Back to the wall."
"It changes you."
"Perfect, very good."
"Go ahead, drink."
"Precautionary measure."
"Did you answer?"
"Are you out?"
"In the aisle."
"No milk."
"Yes, tell me."
"What are you watching?"
"Where is Connie?"
"I am from?"
"I invented."
"This is Ricky."
"In a taxi."
"And the guns?"
"He is obsessed."
"I was relieved."
"Well, we'll see."
"His grandson."
"We can discuss."
"They are real."
"He's talking to you."
"Dancing?"
"You are an accomplice."
"I am connected."
"He got it."
"Good advice."
"Find answers."
"Oh, by the way."
"You are elegant."
"What next time?"
"They have to pay."
"In one day?"
"You were perfect."
"They will believe you."
"No deposit."
"Oh, my heart."
"More light."
"Call me Jim."
"What do you care?"
"Here, my darling."
"Raise your leg."
"You have to be careful."
"Get your strength."
"But come in."
"He will find me."
"We see everything."
"We have to get moving."
"It was romantic."
"Not many people."
"Leaving town?"
"You are expected."
"He is right."
"Are you crazy?"
"Of course, Captain."
"It should have."
"After the ceremony."
"Go ahead, go."
"Go ahead, leave."
"Where is Marty?"
"It was spectacular."
"I follow her."
"Boss, are you okay?"
"Take them all."
"Come on, let's eat."
"She was huge."
"Here is my address."
"A great writer."
"I'm high."
"I like this."
"No mobile."
"Are you there?"
"That's better."
"You stare at me."
"We have them."
"Go find him."
"At the latest."
"She is elsewhere."
"He is straight."
"God be with you."
"It terrifies me."
"Watch your words."
"You sing well."
"In this building?"
"Go back to the office."
"Our first kiss."
"She's going home."
"Where is Brick?"
"Congratulations."
"Don't dream."
"I am motivated."
"You were busy."
"It will be perfect."
"No more betting."
"And the concert?"
"Keep up the good work."
"You start on Monday."
"This is Ari."
"Watch your fingers."
"Can we play?"
"Another wedding."
"You should move."
"They're going out."
"Do you want to order?"
"How much do you owe?"
"Good night, boss."
"Three more."
"That's understandable."
"The same guy."
"Move your feet."
"She was old."
"Keep dancing."

"Let's discuss it."
"On your right."
"All my friends."

"Will you talk to him?"
"A new record."
"No signature."
"With your father?"
"Is that enough for you?"
"They are fresh."
"Sounds like me."
"In the room."
"I know everything."
"And the customers?"
"Not someone."
"And how so?"
"It starts now."

"You must know this."
"You must know that."
"It is one."
"I am your friend."
"Which way is it?"
"We're all here."
"It's very easy."
"You have to see this."
"That's cool, right?"
"I can explain to you."
"Glad to see you."
"What were you thinking?"
"He's over there."
"I want to see them."
"Thanks for the advice."
"Ah, it's you."
"I know that feeling."
"I'm on my way."
"Who sent you?"
"What did you see?"
"I'll see you tomorrow."
"That's an understatement."
"I have friends."
"He was right there."
"I would like to talk to you."
"Yeah, that's good."
"It was my mother."
"Something like that."
"You did this?"
"Don't ask me."
"I loved him very much."
"Glad to see you."
"Give him a chance."
"What are we talking about?"
"Does she know?"
"It's the opposite."
"I am a professional."
"Like everyone else."
"Why did you come?"
"Why did you come?"
"Give me your phone."
"Not once."
"They are on their way."
"I'm calling a taxi."
"Hello, how are you?"
"But where is he?"
"You know the rules."
"Hello to you too."
"A little wine?"
"Yes, I love you."
"How much longer?"
"I found them."
"Do you want to try it?"
"It was very good."
"You were quick."
"I'm like you."
"How dare you?"
"He is upstairs."
"Thank you for your attention."
"It's a trick."
"In half an hour."
"Yes, it's better."
"Is that okay?"
"I forgot it."
"We are safe."
"Let me be clear."
"I don't judge."
"Are you going home?"
"Is this yours?"
"What is it about?"
"What is it about?"
"Sorry about all this."
"Hey, it's me."
"I'll see you tomorrow."
"I'm one of them."
"I'm going to get ready."
"Is this your wife?"
"I love children."
"This is your chance."
"He's still here."
"We all know it."
"Offered by the house."
"It must be there."
"How is your wife?"
"She said no."
"What do I do?"
"Where do we start?"
"That's the main thing."
"You're going to love this."
"Good luck to you."
"This is theft."
"What do you know about it?"
"This is his wife."
"You are probably right."
"I'll tell you."
"To all units."
"Is this you?"
"What have we done?"
"I have a date."
"A glass of wine?"
"It's your turn."
"A little bit of everything."
"You're a genius."
"You are a genius."
"They took everything."
"She is like that."
"Is that a yes?"
"Get to the point."
"Let's get to the point."
"We'll see."
"I'll make everything right."
"You're quite right."
"You are quite right."
"Do you have a moment?"
"She doesn't know."
"The door is closed."
"Oh, I get it."
"Where can he be?"
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"I'm going to bed."
"And you know it."
"What's in it?"
"Where are the girls?"
"They are children."
"Do you want a cigarette?"
"It depends on you."
"It depends on you."
"That makes sense."
"You have to see this."
"I know this guy."
"It's going to be hard."
"This is going to be fun."
"I made it all up."
"We have an agreement."
"I've experienced that."
"This is business."
"What did she do?"
"It's really beautiful."
"What do you have there?"
"I heard you."
"I want to stay here."
"Take me with you."
"Take me with you."
"What is she doing there?"
"You look good."
"Let's start at the beginning."
"It won't happen."
"It's so romantic."
"Don't tell him."
"I want one."
"It's very rare."
"Can you prove it?"
"Do you know his name?"
"He is so cute."
"He is so cute."
"That's my idea."
"What do you need?"
"Yes, yes, of course."
"Do this for me."
"Can I kiss you?"
"What did I say?"
"I have something."
"I am a genius."
"You will have wanted it."
"You heard her."
"It's a promise."
"A glass of water?"
"He attacked me."
"I'll take note of that."
"I could do it."
"I love you all."
"This is our home."
"What do you want to know?"
"I like it here."
"What will they do?"
"She doesn't want to."
"You were great."
"I'll take it."
"Whatever you want."
"Is this your daughter?"
"I remember it."
"I wrote it."
"Trust me."
"We have to find him."
"I have plans."
"It's our anniversary."
"What is your job?"
"I'm starving."
"He is a hero."
"We have a lead."
"That was all that was missing."
"He must be there."
"We found her."
"You have to tell him."
"You tricked me."
"What did they say?"
"Where are you at?"
"We know."
"He knows something."
"I have children."
"Do you trust me?"
"There you go, that's good."
"Move on."
"Remember this."
"It's going to be fun."
"You must be right."
"I want my share."
"Take care of her."
"Take care of her."
"You may withdraw."
"Can we talk?"
"I don't say anything."
"I am with him."
"I'll pass."
"It's your decision."
"I know him well."
"What's the point?"
"Where is the boss?"
"Is it that obvious?"
"As fast as possible."
"It's business."
"I was passing by."
"You need to calm down."
"Are you looking for someone?"
"I gave up."
"I have a name."
"I feel something."
"It won't last."
"Yes, that's it."
"We can work it out."
"This is the protocol."
"Have a good night."
"It's been a while."
"We are with you."
"I've seen better."
"Who found it?"
"May the best man win."
"He's in there."
"I was delighted."
"I grew up here."
"I didn't ask for anything."
"You heard right."
"You heard right."
"I was almost there."
"It's all in there."
"Do you have a second?"
"You promised me."
"Do you want to talk to him?"
"Do you want to talk to him?"
"I'm going with you."
"I'm going with you."
"Go get the car."
"Give me a hug."
"I love this movie."
"I love you, man."
"How old are you?"
"Do you have a phone?"
"It's a tradition."
"They are all the same."
"He was my brother."
"The choice is yours."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"You are so beautiful."
"It goes without saying."
"You just arrived."
"Where is my bag?"
"They are with me."
"It's from me."
"Like last time."
"Tell me about him."
"Hey, how are you?"
"Let's get started."
"It's quite simple."
"I see someone."
"Let's not stay here."
"Stay close to me."
"She has nothing."
"I liked it."
"I liked it."
"Well, well."
"Can I talk to him?"
"Let me go for a bit."
"I come in peace."
"You want my opinion?"
"I've arranged everything."
"Don't be shy."
"I'm going with him."
"Goodbye, my love."
"Thank you for waiting."
"Why is he here?"
"Where is your mom?"
"I wanted to see you."
"Enough about me."
"How charming."
"My place is here."
"No, it's you."
"The game is over."
"All this for what?"
"But everything is fine."
"We have time."
"I can't hear."
"Please leave a message."
"Once or twice."
"I have more."
"Something interesting?"
"This is the market."
"I feel responsible."
"Thank you for doing this."
"OK, I understand."
"I'm in a meeting."
"I heard her."
"A little bit."
"Try to relax."
"It's good here."
"So, is that it?"
"What am I going to do?"
"I am her husband."
"How romantic."
"Do you want a beer?"
"Give me a kiss."
"You have five minutes."
"They must be stopped."
"I am."
"They won't come."
"How is your leg?"
"It's written there."
"Come to my office."
"I am your son."
"I promise you."
"You wouldn't dare."
"I believed it."
"You are very kind."
"You are very kind."
"You are an angel."
"It's really amazing."
"You are a man."
"How touching."
"I want to end it."
"Is this your husband?"
"Tell me more."
"Tell me more."
"I followed him."
"And where is he?"
"It's much better."
"But who is it?"
"No further questions."
"Where are you from?"
"Where are you from?"
"Thank you for the tea."
"And I will."
"She is safe."
"Do you have children?"
"Where was I?"
"I need to rest."
"We kissed."
"At this time?"
"Would you like some tea?"
"She was my wife."
"Some coffee?"
"You can keep it."
"Did you see me?"
"This is his house."
"The door opens."
"You make me laugh."
"We'll find something."
"When did you arrive?"
"But I'm fine."
"We have a plan."
"Not that way."
"I assure you."
"This is his mother."
"The hearing is adjourned."
"Is it that important?"
"Is this an interrogation?"
"Did you tell them?"
"Take care of that."
"It's almost midnight."
"I have a migraine."
"This is my patient."
"You need to rest."
"He is very sick."
"You have to get used to it."
"What are you thinking about?"
"Did you call him?"
"What do I tell them?"
"Can we see it?"
"You will never change."
"We'll manage."
"I don't have them."
"Did you understand correctly?"
"It's a bluff."
"I'm still here."
"Just a little bit."
"It's so cute."
"We have work to do."
"It's very nice."
"What do we have here?"
"I bet not."
"I already knew that."
"But who are you?"
"I went there."
"They are yours."
"Who said it?"
"I thought you were gone."
"I'm going now."
"Do you have his address?"
"Tell me what to do."
"No, I don't think so."
"He needs it."
"So what do we do?"
"It's the past."
"Who is this guy?"
"We slept together."
"What are you working on?"
"But it will be okay."
"I have to concentrate."
"Don't you understand?"
"You asked me?"
"If it is possible."
"What more can I say?"
"Thanks for asking."
"Let's try again."
"Make love to me."
"I accept your apology."
"Go ahead, do it."
"Do you want some advice?"
"I was looking for you everywhere."
"I bought it."
"I bought it."
"It's my business."
"No, you can't."
"She said it."
"Who's coming with me?"
"You should see this."
"Of course, my dear."
"You did a good job."
"You did a good job."
"How did you know?"
"You get used to it."
"We have to find him."
"I am on duty."
"Tell me one thing."
"Tell me one thing."
"I will miss him."
"You have a gift."
"It's very romantic."
"This is the signal."
"I fought."
"This is our secret."
"The honor is yours."
"I'll take you there."
"Do you want a sandwich?"
"Where is my family?"
"Do you believe it?"
"You can believe me."
"See for yourself."
"See for yourself."
"He likes me."
"So, how was it?"
"They are mine."
"I know how to do it."
"It's my responsibility."
"He is a thief."
"What do we do now?"
"I'm just curious."
"I would like to meet him."
"He's up there."
"I don't know anything about it."
"You understood everything."
"Do you want to hear it?"
"Get on your knees."
"It's very close."
"What is it called?"
"Not as much as you."
"It's a chance."
"That was the goal."
"Thanks for the ride."
"But I can't."
"I'm thinking of you."
"It's solid."
"I'll call them."
"What is my name?"
"Because of me?"
"But thank you anyway."
"You heard right."
"But on one condition."
"Promise me one thing."
"What are you playing?"
"What are you playing?"
"Good luck, guys."
"It's so good."
"Yes, you know it."
"Do me a favor."
"I'll find her."
"It was very beautiful."
"I wasn't sleeping."
"Here we are."
"Thanks for trying."
"And I love it."
"What would you like to drink?"
"Oh, that's great."
"What are your plans?"
"Yet it is true."
"What was his name?"
"That's done."
"But it happened."
"Take care of him."
"What do you call that?"
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
"Well, good luck."
"The situation has changed."
"Thank you for your visit."
"I am leaving in the evening."
"Where is he from?"
"Who is your friend?"
"What are we doing here?"
"The police are here."
"Yes, it's over."
"She's a witch."
"Can you hear me?"
"Yes, he's fine."
"The night brings counsel."
"Thanks for the tip."
"Not just a little."
"Do you know my name?"
"I'll wait here."
"Yes, let's go."
"She needs it."
"But I love him."
"Who's next?"
"You are a hero."
"Shall we race?"
"You don't have to."
"Who should I announce?"
"I have my sources."
"One thing is certain."
"You have one hour."
"I am very happy."
"Let's go, guys."
"Don't you see?"
"I'm a cop."
"Give me the money."
"The case is closed."
"The subject is closed."
"It's his."
"It's for him."
"I know the truth."
"What was I thinking?"
"You could say that."
"It's almost there."
"Oh, thank God."
"That's interesting."
"I love him so much."
"Answer my question."
"What kind of stuff?"
"It works for me."
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
"Do you really want to know?"
"I take my coat."
"Let me be clear."
"She just left."
"Where is the catch?"
"I have proof."
"Nobody is."
"I'll talk to him about it."
"Am I scaring you?"
"He's coming with us."
"Because of you."
"I called her."
"Stay tuned."
"Yeah, you're right."
"The good old days."
"Can I call you back?"
"It's your job."
"What happened to her?"
"Glad to hear it."
"Good night everyone."
"Can't it wait?"
"Why did you come?"
"Why did you come?"
"This is your home."
"I love you, baby."
"Did you know?"
"Where did you go?"
"Where have you been?"
"He is ours."
"Do as you wish."
"That was the plan."
"What did you learn?"
"If God wills."
"Where did he come from?"
"How is your father?"
"I promised him."
"I am his daughter."
"Where are they now?"
"Nothing for the moment."
"It's very exciting."
"What are you doing standing up?"
"How could you?"
"How could you?"
"The meal is ready."
"She tells the truth."
"I'll tell you."
"It's Latin."
"He said why?"
"Who are you talking to?"
"You are at home."
"You know that, right?"
"It's yours."
"Do you have one?"
"Do you have one?"
"Can you forgive me?"
"Is this your house?"
"This is the key."
"I would like to talk to him."
"It doesn't respond."
"There are no more."
"Yes, I know her."
"I know that name."
"Thank you for the flowers."
"I have a job."
"I would have liked to."
"Speaking of the wolf."
"You are a sweetheart."
"I'm sure of it."
"But what is it?"
"Be on time."
"I was held back."
"I have a call."
"You are my daughter."
"Do you have the money?"
"Don't push me."
"Let's start from the beginning."
"I'll wait outside."
"That's the word."
"I'll leave it to you."
"What is the question?"
"I'm going to rest."
"What did you answer?"
"How did you guess?"
"How is your arm?"
"What did you find?"
"What did you find?"
"I have the situation under control."
"Can I try it?"
"I have questions."
"Where are my things?"
"I'm going to see her."
"You'll get used to it."
"I give it to you."
"That's true, yes."
"What is your secret?"
"That's the main thing."
"It's a theory."
"Who is the victim?"
"So who is it?"
"Do you have a card?"
"I call my lawyer."
"Do you have a cigarette?"
"Everything will be fine."
"It's been years."
"They don't answer."
"How is the family?"
"We'll take care of it."
"We're having fun."
"I bet you do."
"Can you hear yourself talking?"
"I don't dance."
"Thank you all."
"I feel nauseous."
"I had one."
"I am speechless."
"I am a scientist."
"Thank you for calling."
"Yes, I noticed."
"This is his son."
"Thank you, everyone."
"So it's true?"
"I invited him."
"And who are you?"
"I am your friend."
"What does it look like?"
"We are in America."
"Yes, it's great."
"I took it."
"I see very well."
"Do you know this man?"
"Oh, you know what?"
"Where is your wife?"
"I want to hear it."
"He's tough."
"The sun rises."
"Well done, guys."
"Can you believe that?"
"Take a deep breath."
"Join us."
"Can I come with you?"
"Where is the chest?"
"You can talk to me."
"Where do they come from?"
"I still do."
"It's his car."
"I like it."
"We'll work it out."
"What is this here?"
"That's my job."
"I have to find her."
"It's family."
"You know that?"
"I'll catch you."
"I ask the questions."
"Yes, if you want."
"Have a good evening."
"You can have it."
"I know enough."
"We found it."
"Where were we?"
"Will you excuse me?"
"I am an artist."
"That's how it was."
"Where do you think you are?"
"Sure, go ahead."
"Sure, go ahead."
"What should I do?"
"What was I supposed to do?"
"It was a surprise."
"I am in position."
"Have you been there?"
"Have you been there?"
"I am your husband."
"You deserved it."
"As soon as possible."
"Let me do it."
"I'll come get you."
"You don't want to?"
"How is your wife?"
"It's a deal."
"Let's start at the beginning."
"I have connections."
"What's yours?"
"It was my decision."
"Women first."
"And he left."
"Goodbye, my friend."
"That's new."
"We have some questions."
"I was going to call you."
"I would say yes."
"What's the point?"
"You are my father."
"It's almost ready."
"Don't think about it."
"Oh, it's you."
"You heard her."
"Go ahead, guys."
"Who are you?"
"You will be safe."
"You will be safe."
"He is at home."
"They found us."
"But not this time."
"I'm early."
"Okay, I'll go."
"I found you."
"She just arrived."
"What are the chances?"
"That's all there is to it."
"You know very well."
"I think it's great."
"We're going together."
"That's probably it."
"Is this the truth?"
"You don't drink?"
"She's still there."
"They took it."
"It had to be said."
"I will teach you."
"They are animals."
"And for what reason?"
"I have to tell him."
"What do I do now?"
"You are the best."
"Mom, where are you?"
"You're going to get it."
"Just once."
"Do you think you're smart?"
"They all look the same."
"They know."
"I have to go now."
"This is heavy stuff."
"You are very handsome."
"They are still there."
"Do you know him well?"
"Do you know him well?"
"I would have done the same."
"I want a name."
"I won it."
"Hey, it's me."
"It's still warm."
"This is his father."
"Yes, I love it."
"We'll talk about it again tomorrow."
"What is the word?"
"I got it."
"I have a girlfriend."
"I'm right, right?"
"But yes, you can."
"I am the boss."
"I love you too."
"Thank you for lunch."
"They are back."
"Your mother is right."
"Yes, it's done."
"Gunshots."
"How interesting."
"Just in case what?"
"Give us a minute."
"Why are you interested?"
"No, it's different."
"What did you see?"
"It must be me."
"No, I swear."
"I don't remember."
"I'll come back later."
"I'm proud of it."
"I don't play anymore."
"We're going to get it."
"That's true, right?"
"Can I accompany you?"
"I am a girl."
"What is the verdict?"
"A friend of yours?"
"May I know why?"
"Are you talking about me?"
"The password?"
"Have you met him?"
"How do we do that?"
"I have a solution."
"I love this guy."
"I love this guy."
"It's my right."
"We must find him."
"I'll make sure of it."
"Get rid of him."
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"I can handle it."
"How many do you want?"
"I have the address."
"You, come with me."
"I'll open it."
"Do you have a plan?"
"So how are you?"
"So, how are you?"
"I didn't understand."
"Let me think about it."
"You are very kind."
"This is quite normal."
"Ah, it's you."
"It was a compliment."
"She called me."
"More and more."
"Welcome to the neighborhood."
"How's your head?"
"He is on his way."
"This is your father."
"It seems so."
"It will be fine."
"Yes, yes, I know."
"What can I do?"
"At the end of the corridor."
"Do you want to go there?"
"It's so quiet."
"What were you talking about?"
"I'm going to marry her."
"I didn't think so."
"I didn't think so."
"Who is the girl?"
"I learned that."
"Stay in the car."
"Wait a little longer."
"Do you have any proof?"
"Let's hope it works."
"When was that?"
"It goes without saying."
"Shall we make peace?"
"All right, guys."
"Yeah, that's him."
"It's a code."
"How can I be sure?"
"I hope so."
"That's enough."
"Nobody came."
"It's a message."
"He just came out."
"It's very funny."
"I have to go home."
"It's really delicious."
"Who do you work for?"
"Who do you work for?"
"You are my hero."
"Yes, he is here."
"It's all you."
"I already have it."
"Where are my glasses?"
"And what do I do?"
"This is how it works."
"No, she's right."
"This place is awesome."
"God rest his soul."
"I love it too."
"I apologized."
"It's between us."
"Do you know anything about it?"
"She's already gone."
"Don't talk to him."
"Have you thought about it?"
"Who are you then?"
"No, he's fine."
"I woke up."
"Where should I go?"
"Would you like some tea?"
"For the last time."
"Oh, that's cute."
"This is the opportunity."
"It fits you well."
"You have to do it."
"What is the address?"
"She said yes."
"Thank you for meeting me."
"I prefer to stand."
"Where are you from?"
"Where are you from?"
"How are you, sir?"
"He is an artist."
"What were you thinking?"
"What were you thinking?"
"I want to be part of it."
"It's very cute."
"And here is the work."
"May God keep you."
"Where is the map?"
"Will you calm down?"
"That remains to be seen."
"I will always be there."
"As you please."
"Neither seen nor known."
"I heard them."
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"He's the boss."
"It was something."
"Where is your mother?"
"Nobody believes me."
"I was late."
"God bless America."
"It's quite possible."
"We found this."
"I'll pay you back for that."
"All this for nothing."
"This is the right one."
"There are some everywhere."
"They will be here soon."
"Yes, that would be good."
"You have time."
"It's a chameleon."
"What was the question?"
"Tell me your name."
"It suits you well."
"The line is cut."
"What are your orders?"
"Let's go get some fresh air."
"Not good at all."
"Not good at all."
"How did you feel?"
"It still is."
"I have a child."
"She is very kind."
"He is very intelligent."
"Like clockwork."
"She's his daughter."
"Is that right?"
"You are all the same."
"Yes, I assure you."
"I am grateful to you."
"Is this really necessary?"
"It's always like that."
"I love surprises."
"It's morning."
"Watch your head."
"Do you want to see them?"
"Do you have a boyfriend?"
"She kissed me."
"I see things."
"The car is here."
"I watch TV."
"It's a machine."
"See you soon."
"I'll see you soon."
"No, don't do that."
"It just happened."
"Do you know how to do that?"
"I saw you."
"I can see that."
"He is very strong."
"Let's play a game."
"Thanks for the beer."
"You're probably right."
"Are you having a drink?"
"We finally meet."
"I'm fine now."
"How do you explain it?"
"Do you have a moment?"
"You found me."
"It's so exciting."
"You could have called."
"I mean, yes."
"Get on your knees."
"Yes, it looks like it."
"And that's good."
"What is your first name?"
"It's not pretty."
"I'll take you back."
"I didn't ask."
"You can do it."
"I want an answer."
"Give me a name."
"The end of the world."
"I'm fine, really."
"No, it's great."
"He's your friend."
"I have two children."
"He will be here soon."
"Take care of her."
"It's your destiny."
"You have a family."
"I'm done."
"We have one."
"It was your idea."
"Go without me."
"But that's good."
"She's a beauty."
"I can show you."
"You're probably right."
"This place is amazing."
"So where is she?"
"The world has changed."
"Who is she?"
"Everyone knows."
"I'm talking about you."
"What is it again?"
"A little further."
"He deserved it."
"I am one."
"You will love it."
"You asked for it."
"You'll like it."
"Thank you for your time."
"Can I help you?"
"Do you want to go back?"
"He spoke to me."
"It's super good."
"She's not breathing."
"Yes, that's it."
"In a way, yes."
"You were great."
"But it is necessary."
"She's not breathing anymore."
"I can't say."
"I want one."
"I am the boss."
"Can I keep it?"
"I'll look into that."
"You are so pretty."
"How did you get in?"
"How did you get in?"
"Until the end."
"You're not eating?"
"Is this an invitation?"
"In the other direction."
"We can always try."
"It's completely different."
"You know the rest."
"What is this?"
"It's his life."
"He's an imposter."
"I can call you?"
"Do you want to talk to me?"
"I'll tell them."
"Do you believe it?"
"I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
"Where is the captain?"
"Thank you both."
"Need anything else?"
"I would like a room."
"The coffee is ready."
"We'll see each other again soon."
"It's already better."
"I'll leave you."
"That's very nice."
"Tell me something."
"What did you take?"
"Who was this man?"
"They are over there."
"I'm going to freshen up."
"It should be good."
"Did you get it?"
"I am so happy."
"You don't know her."
"What are you working on?"
"Here's another one."
"There, that's better."
"I have something else."
"Do you believe me now?"
"Los Angeles Police Department."
"I am like you."
"I really want it."
"Did you know him well?"
"Where are we now?"
"Oh yes, of course."
"You are absolutely right."
"The time has come."
"Do you like music?"
"I looked everywhere."
"It's the same for me."
"You are still young."
"Do it yourself."
"No, thank you."
"No, thank you."
"No, thank you."
"Yeah, I get it."
"Now I know."
"Is he with you?"
"No, it's him."
"Not to this extent."
"No, you're right."
"Yes, for now."
"Did you do that?"
"And that's it."
"I'll tell you everything."
"Where is your father?"
"You'll get through this."
"When did you get back?"
"What would you have done?"
"Am I interrupting something?"
"She's upstairs."
"There is better."
"I want to know."
"It takes time."
"It's going to be good."
"Say hello to him."
"It's very different."
"With all my heart."
"With all my heart."
"And the other two?"
"Do you want some wine?"
"What was that again?"
"They are yours."
"It comes down to the same thing."
"They all are."
"I am the father."
"Where is she from?"
"Good luck to all."
"For now, yes."
"Nothing is true."
"Tell them the truth."
"What did it give?"
"I'm on a mission."
"Do you really want it?"
"Nice to see you again."
"Thank you for your hospitality."
"She's my cousin."
"He scores a point."
"I'm right here."
"Go back to your room."
"Actually, yes."
"Where did he go?"
"Where did he go?"
"Yes, that's clear."
"You already know that."
"Take all the time you need."
"Come near me."
"It wasn't necessary."
"Did you say that?"
"Have a good night."
"I'm your man."
"All right, go ahead."
"Do you have money?"
"I am the king."
"Where are you?"
"It's the opposite."
"Yes, it was."
"That's good."
"No trace of him."
"It was for you."
"I'll never get there."
"What's going on?"
"Who hired you?"
"The situation is serious."
"She's back."
"She is with us."
"Can we talk to you?"
"This is my apartment."
"And what about you?"
"What did you answer?"
"It remains to be seen."
"We'll talk later."
"Don't say that."
"You don't believe me?"
"What is the program?"
"The meeting is open."
"We have to find her."
"I fainted."
"It's a shortcut."
"This is so unfair."
"I have to get back to work."
"I can't breathe."
"She wants to talk to you."
"Where is my sister?"
"A little music?"
"When was that?"
"Where are you now?"
"In a way."
"We're live."
"I just understood."
"Give me a minute."
"Where did she go?"
"What's the score?"
"You're almost there."
"It's the custom."
"How we meet again."
"There, that's good."
"It's straight ahead."
"It's going to be okay, darling."
"That's me."
"It's right here."
"I like this idea."
"Don't even try."
"This is an opportunity."
"Yes, roughly."
"Is it that serious?"
"You are a hero."
"It's wonderful, isn't it?"
"I owe you."
"I owe you."
"It's a love."
"You need it."
"Where are you taking us?"
"A little seriousness."
"I want to apologize."
"You don't recognize me?"
"I am safe."
"What does he look like?"
"Do you come here often?"
"Do you come here often?"
"I just started."
"Are you taking anything?"
"Who said that?"
"Hey, where are you going?"
"If you can say so."
"They got it."
"I wouldn't dare."
"He came here."
"Can I see you?"
"I'll come back for you."
"It's your job."
"I'll bring him back."
"I have the solution."
"Give me a chance."
"You can do it."
"Who sent you?"
"What are the orders?"
"Where are you from?"
"She is late."
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen."
"Your table is ready."
"So everything is fine."
"I took it."
"I'll wait for him."
"It's just me."
"Is this from you?"
"Is this from you?"
"What was his name?"
"I was at home."
"What did you hear?"
"What did you hear?"
"Have a nice day."
"No, I don't want to."
"He's his brother."
"Not for me, thank you."
"You can do better."
"Where are your parents?"
"He is very talented."
"What can you do?"
"Go home."
"It's his."
"The bar is closed."
"Make room."
"It's a choice."
"What are you playing?"
"This is my nephew."
"You don't know anything about it."
"I am a private detective."
"It's been forever."
"How did you know?"
"A little lower."
"Do you still love me?"
"Do you still love me?"
"Where do you think you're going?"
"I have a suggestion."
"I have it here."
"I think not."
"I miss her so much."
"Are you in charge of it?"
"It's his idea."
"I am an adult."
"Take me home."
"Why are you here?"
"Can you explain to me?"
"What are you doing here?"
"Pour me a drink."
"What is the connection?"
"I have to find him."
"I'm going to find her."
"Where is the child?"
"I heard you."
"How would you know?"
"She's a kid."
"Are you with me?"
"You can leave now."
"Sorry to hear that."
"Sorry to hear that."
"Guess who it is?"
"I love you, son."
"I will pray for you."
"Come home."
"Nobody knows anything."
"It's a movie."
"I found you."
"Shall we have a drink?"
"We have to talk."
"Do you have any news?"
"How did he get in?"
"Stay a little longer."
"You are like me."
"She is very good."
"This is my uncle."
"May God forgive me."
"I am very happy."
"In a safe place."
"I have homework."
"Are you going to call him?"
"Can you prove it?"
"Can you prove it?"
"It's a hospital."
"But it's different."
"No, not for me."
"Why do you think that?"
"They don't exist."
"I'm happy about it."
"They are for you."
"This is my chance."
"It's so exciting."
"Keep your eyes open."
"Keep your eyes open."
"The show is over."
"I come from the future."
"We'll see you tomorrow."
"I hope not."
"It was his choice."
"No sign of him."
"You understood me."
"Yes, who is it?"
"How are things going?"
"I'll take one."
"Do you have the keys?"
"I love you very much."
"I'll be direct."
"Hey, you know what?"
"This is who I am."
"What did you discover?"
"You were awesome."
"Don't make any noise."
"Yes, that's right."
"Yes, I hear you."
"God be with you."
"Yes, it is necessary."
"Yes, it is necessary."
"It's looking good."
"Are you local?"
"Do you want my picture?"
"We're all going."
"I'm downstairs."
"I know so."
"Do you have one?"
"Do you have one?"
"It's really beautiful."
"Too late for what?"
"Can you do it?"
"Why is he here?"
"I wanted to do it."
"I want to talk to them."
"You should be happy."
"Do you have a daughter?"
"I'm very hungry."
"I'll let you work."
"Do you have children?"
"We'll talk about it tomorrow."
"How old were you?"
"She's downstairs."
"This is my boyfriend."
"And besides that?"
"Stuff like that."
"It's all thought out."
"That's good too."
"That's just as well."
"Do you have a family?"
"He is so kind."
"Come back whenever you want."
"It's his."
"Give me your keys."
"What kind of market?"
"Do you want to know?"
"And you were right."
"I'm going back to bed."
"Everyone to your posts."
"You don't answer?"
"I checked everything."
"So who is it?"
"It was mine."
"The police will arrive."
"The game is over."
"He looked for it."
"Do you want some?"
"Is that your name?"
"We start from scratch."
"The party is over."
"I know you well."
"I will introduce you."
"This isn't going to work."
"That's an understatement."
"If you insist."
"That was the idea."
"I forgot about it."
"I have a secret."
"It wasn't that."
"Tell him yourself."
"Where is the dog?"
"Right, guys?"
"Thank you, that's nice."
"This is my phone."
"You have talent."
"We'll see about that tomorrow."
"He woke up."
"It must be hard."
"It's a riddle."
"But what's the point?"
"I am his son."
"Did you see this?"
"Did you see that?"
"What is the goal?"
"I still love him."
"And I was right."
"I can understand that."
"You should sit down."
"I learned a lot."
"If you want."
"If you want."
"Hold on to me."
"And everything will be fine."
"I have a lead."
"I have already given."
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"This is my case."
"I was called."
"This is our destiny."
"Is this the case?"
"She said why?"
"When did it start?"
"He is really good."
"No matter the price."
"We all have them."
"I'm on call."
"I drink to that."
"Do you have someone?"
"I was saying that to myself too."
"You have just arrived."
"I'll take that one."
"What are they talking about?"
"It suits me."
"What kind of business?"
"How do you do that?"
"Tell me what to do."
"Yes, I remember."
"It will be fine like this."
"No, you were right."
"She's on her way."
"Lots of things."
"Yeah, I see that."
"Yes, Your Honor."
"It's a job."
"She scares me."
"I'll give it to you."
"What, is that all?"
"What were you doing there?"
"One day you will understand."
"It's been a year."
"They are mine."
"I don't know."
"It goes without saying."
"Give me the keys."
"He was a friend."
"I'll get it."
"Who is this guy?"
"Relax a little."
"I'm a fan."
"I wasn't there."
"Where are the boys?"
"Where is my phone?"
"Something to say?"
"There you go."
"Can we sit down?"
"I have a wife."
"We have a mission."
"I can't breathe anymore."
"We discussed it."
"I said it all."
"Excuse me for a second."
"How old was she?"
"Do you want something to drink?"
"I'll take you there."
"How are you going to do it?"
"We found them."
"What should we do?"
"She's my niece."
"He is an actor."
"Did I do well?"
"You tricked me."
"You were quick."
"Hey, what's up?"
"You don't drink?"
"I'll call you tomorrow."
"They are the best."
"But you are right."
"I know things."
"This is my boy."
"Stay on your guard."
"You must leave now."
"You have to leave now."
"Where is my mom?"
"Can I open it?"
"Where are my children?"
"I wanted to protect you."
"I like being here."
"There are some."
"Maybe both."
"How does it feel?"
"I know where to go."
"Come to my office."
"So, is it good?"
"What do you want to do?"
"Did you call her?"
"Is your father here?"
"Excuse us for a moment."
"I'll take it off."
"He works for me."
"You owe me."
"And what do you do?"
"And what do you do?"
"Do you have a room?"
"I'll take them."
"I ask to see."
"You're early."
"She's good, huh?"
"You have a call."
"Where are my clothes?"
"I have his address."
"What is this?"
"The account is there."
"I was delighted."
"You can take it."
"You look good together."
"I love you, darling."
"I'm retiring."
"I already am."
"He is for me."
"You are so beautiful."
"You know the rule."
"The road is closed."
"The visits are over."
"Do you have any news?"
"And you are right."
"A friend of yours?"
"Do you want to have fun?"
"A year and a half."
"I am over the moon."
"He's a psychopath."
"What's happening?"
"He's a guy."
"What are we talking about?"
"Do you have your papers?"
"Yeah, for sure."
"It's quite far."
"Who are you?"
"They don't understand."
"She's your sister."
"I'm staying with you."
"Can you do this?"
"Where is your car?"
"I have three."
"This is America."
"I saw you."
"He's a vampire."
"Return to your posts."
"It's your money."
"Do we have a choice?"
"I'm going to town."
"And here we are."
"A friend of mine."
"Where are you going?"
"Calm down, guys."
"That's all him."
"I forgot everything."
"You have one hour."
"He is one of us."
"What does that rhyme with?"
"It will be with pleasure."
"No, that's for sure."
"It's obvious."
"We are with you."
"Can I take this?"
"She was so beautiful."
"She was right there."
"Give me one."
"Give me one."
"This is so true."
"I have to see you."
"Are you going on a trip?"
"There's nothing better."
"I have a life."
"You go home."
"Right on time."
"Ask your mother."
"What are you saying?"
"It is well known."
"You want to know what?"
"It's work."
"Can I know why?"
"I sold it."
"Did this really happen?"
"I thought you were gone."
"Whatever you want."
"Are you asking me?"
"How much do I owe you?"
"I accept your apologies."
"Did you call me?"
"Do you promise me?"
"I'm happy to."
"Where do you want to go?"
"From time to time."
"You can't know."
"Goodbye, my darling."
"That's your thing."
"You don't trust me?"
"It will stay between us."
"Do you know this guy?"
"Do you trust him?"
"Shall we take a tour?"
"That was very kind."
"Something must be done."
"He's coming this way."
"I have my idea."
"I'm almost done."
"Don't you want some?"
"Lean on me."
"I'll pass it to you."
"I'll pass it to you."
"Do you want an ice cream?"
"Do you want to kiss me?"
"He was my son."
"I love this city."
"She's my fiancée."
"May I ask why?"
"Do you have the key?"
"This complicates things."
"I understood it."
"So, it's settled."
"Give me the key."
"Do you really believe that?"
"How is your hand?"
"Nobody knows him."
"I still love you."
"I prefer to stay here."
"Watch your head."
"How do you spell it?"
"Nothing, everything is fine."
"I only have that."
"You haven't changed."
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
"I believed it."
"That's it."
"No, she's fine."
"He is very close."
"Good night, guys."
"I'll wait for you outside."
"Do you like me?"
"So, is that it?"
"You need to rest."
"I'll be right there."
"Let me see this."
"We form a team."
"Do you still love him?"
"Where are the people?"
"I want to meet him."
"No, he's gone."
"We must find her."
"We have to find her."
"You are the best."
"You are the best."
"Who is this person?"
"They are already here."
"She looks like my mother."
"Where does he come from?"
"Where does he come from?"
"Can you hear me?"
"Give me the address."
"Where do we start?"
"It was a woman."
"Sir, are you all right?"
"Did you follow me?"
"I have the right."
"What is this thing?"
"What's your secret?"
"What is the answer?"
"Do you want to see me?"
"You always do that."
"Where do you think you are?"
"I need it."
"I know one thing."
"I have it here."
"I'm on duty."
"You must not."
"I think it's great."
"Give me the money."
"You have my number."
"You have my number."
"Driving licence and registration document."
"Well, let's go."
"I'm so excited."
"What did he look like?"
"It's over, right?"
"What am I doing here?"
"I'll fix this."
"We can do it."
"He is in a meeting."
"We saw it."
"Do you recognize this man?"
"Do you recognize this man?"
"Call me later."
"I am so happy."
"Come inside."
"It's in there."
"What did you learn?"
"Welcome to the team."
"Are you from here?"
"And you believe it?"
"Can I be honest?"
"She's in there."
"Am I dreaming or what?"
"It's pretty good."
"Gift from home."
"The meeting is over."
"What should I do?"
"Good night, my darling."
"I've been watching you."
"You're my brother."
"That could be nice."
"They are friends."
"This is a new one."
"Why did you come?"
"It's a wedding."
"I wanted to ask you."
"I stay with him."
"The car is ready."
"It's his decision."
"You can stay here."
"Where are you at?"
"I have responsibilities."
"Yes, it was good."
"You won't go."
"But for what purpose?"
"You have no idea."
"What do you want to drink?"
"Who do you work for?"
"Do you know his name?"
"I followed you."
"Yeah, absolutely."
"I just want to know."
"Yes, it's fine."
"We are still here."
"They saw us."
"Because of that."
"We come in peace."
"Do you believe that?"
"It is possible, yes."
"Ask your father."
"Do you have any plans?"
"You have to tell him."
"I'm waiting for your call."
"Yes, if you want."
"When did you arrive?"
"When did you arrive?"
"Sorry about last night."
"Don't you remember?"
"Oh, that's nice."
"But he's right."
"And he was right."
"I want to marry him."
"You betrayed me."
"Yeah, that's cool."
"Get him out of here."
"That's very true."
"How many do you want?"
"How much do you want?"
"What is the target?"
"How do I do that?"
"You know me well."
"They are on their way."
"Will it take long?"
"Look out the window."
"I live next door."
"You are one of us."
"Do you want a candy?"
"What else is there to say?"
"These are my children."
"We have orders."
"We have orders."
"Are you going to talk to him?"
"Let me understand correctly."
"Are your parents here?"
"But I have to go."
"Thank you very much."
"It's your business."
"Where did they go?"
"Thanks for your patience."
"I like this song."
"Do you have any ideas?"
"Lower your voice."
"You can keep it."
"She is very sick."
"I saw them."
"Who is your friend?"
"Who is your friend?"
"Where do they come from?"
"That's my opinion."
"That's my plan."
"Does that mean yes?"
"You are so kind."
"I would have done it."
"I got you."
"He's a pro."
"Thank you for coming back."
"It's coming."
"He is a soldier."
"Shall we have a drink?"
"Do it for me."
"I have the impression."
"Do you want to come with me?"
"Does that remind you of anything?"
"How is the little one?"
"He still is."
"But where is she?"
"I am very impressed."
"Because of what?"
"I see you coming."
"It was very pleasant."
"Look where we are."
"Did you understand correctly?"
"This is your home."
"What is the number?"
"Nice to see you again."
"To do what there?"
"How old is she?"
"For good reason."
"You can talk to me."
"Take a closer look."
"Oh, that's perfect."
"I know a shortcut."
"He saw everything."
"That's so kind."
"I don't work."
"Where is the remote control?"
"This is the future."
"To tell them what?"
"Everything's fine, Mom."
"Are you there?"
"Tell him to leave."
"It's past midnight."
"Very kind of you."
"You have time."
"She is very good."
"This is the girl."
"Do you really believe that?"
"Do you really believe that?"
"I won't come."
"Thank you for your understanding."
"I'll see you tomorrow."
"How did you guess?"
"Do you want a cigarette?"
"Now it's over."
"But at what cost?"
"Do you still have it?"
"It was the last one."
"Where are you hiding?"
"Where is his mother?"
"That's our thing."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"Do you believe in God?"
"I am the Doctor."
"How convenient."
"I'm going there."
"I'll take a taxi."
"Tell me about her."
"Where have you been?"
"Where have you been?"
"This is a good one."
"Something important."
"How much will that cost?"
"I'll find something."
"I'll call again later."
"It's ours."
"She is ours."
"Just a minute."
"Compared to what?"
"How are you, old man?"
"That's settled."
"He's the boss."
"Life is unfair."
"It's for tomorrow."
"Remind me your name?"
"It's brand new."
"These are his words."
"But it's important."
"You don't feel anything?"
"That's my motto."
"I know her well."
"It's his right."
"Don't let me down."
"They are very close."
"They all say that."
"Would you like anything else?"
"I touched it."
"This is my mission."
"Do you have a lead?"
"I obey orders."
"Where do you think you're going?"
"I'll introduce you."
"It's my business."
"Okay, you know what?"
"By all means."
"Yes, a little bit."
"Where is your sister?"
"She scores a point."
"It's really pretty."
"It's the FBI."
"You must be proud."
"It all depends on you."
"I have my car."
"When did you come back?"
"But where are you going?"
"How do you find it?"
"She is very talented."
"How old is he?"
"One of these days."
"It's night."
"Okay, everyone."
"You don't say anything?"
"Yes, all the time."
"He is on vacation."
"What are they doing there?"
"Are you talking about me?"
"You already know that."
"We have an agreement."
"And who else?"
"Where does he work?"
"Where is the exit?"
"She's still here."
"I was born here."
"What are their names?"
"It's an experience."
"Thank you for your welcome."
"I remember now."
"Do you know anything about it?"
"I'm coming to see you."
"You have me."
"I'm a guy."
"How many are there?"
"I know that too."
"When you're ready."
"Glad to hear it."
"You are very good."
"How many do you have?"
"Where is your son?"
"Are you with us?"
"Are you with us?"
"The class is over."
"He'll get there."
"Such is the world."
"This could be fun."
"These are my parents."
"I'm getting out of here."
"Go back inside."
"It's business."
"Tell me about him."
"It was my dream."
"Always the same story."
"Where is that?"
"Did you take it?"
"I'll bring it to you."
"You were right."
"You were right."
"Who's stopping you?"
"It's much better."
"You should come and see."
"It's your imagination."
"What will become of us?"
"He can do it."
"It's written here."
"It's next door."
"So who is it?"
"I have three children."
"Do you have a cell phone?"
"Give me a smile."
"Go get some fresh air."
"My mother was right."
"What's up?"
"Have you seen it?"
"I'm happy about it."
"I'm having fun."
"At least, not yet."
"Who are you talking to?"
"Who are you talking to?"
"Good luck for tomorrow."
"It no longer exists."
"Do you have any cigarettes?"
"How do I feel?"
"The circle is complete."
"I like your style."
"This is our son."
"I will miss her."
"It's a cover."
"I called them."
"I heard screaming."
"It was to be expected."
"He's a kid."
"It must be important."
"Give him a chance."
"I really messed up."
"We're going to get them."
"You're back."
"I want more."
"We're celebrating."
"He is early."
"Anything to add?"
"Something is eluding me."
"Do you see this guy?"
"You were great."
"This is my dad."
"I have a message."
"Goodbye, girls."
"Get him out of there."
"You are so cute."
"Goodbye, children."
"We have a chance."
"They had a fight."
"Give him a chance."
"They are behind us."
"It wasn't him."
"We have a guest."
"Who found it?"
"We are very close."
"Can I borrow it?"
"Have you seen her?"
"I have the key."
"It's a person."
"It's not surprising."
"Maybe one day."
"Do we agree?"
"I've been busy."
"You are my mother."
"Are you taking care of it?"
"Don't you get it?"
"Is this yours?"
"You are my friend."
"What are you thinking?"
"You get the idea."
"Of course, my dear."
"I would be honored."
"I just learned."
"Your reputation precedes you."
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"I'll send it to you."
"I have to go."
"Where are you taking me?"
"Where are you taking me?"
"Do you really love him?"
"Well, good night."
"Where is my hat?"
"Do you have a moment?"
"It's the wind."
"I can say that."
"Will you give it to me?"
"Yes, it's there."
"Where is your boyfriend?"
"Your father is right."
"Well, I hope."
"Who wants a drink?"
"Do you have a match?"
"This is my dog."
"Do you get along well?"
"Be on your guard."
"Do you want more?"
"We all do it."
"Do you hear anything?"
"Yeah, everything's fine."
"Do you have the phone?"
"They found it."
"I'm behind you."
"I trusted him."
"Have you met him?"
"Am I clear enough?"
"I have pictures."
"I'll warn him."
"Do you know this man?"
"This is our baby."
"Who are the others?"
"Do you want something?"
"Do you want something?"
"A cup of coffee?"
"She's my patient."
"You got me."
"I am leaving in the morning."
"Yes, I will be there."
"No need to thank me."
"Don't take it the wrong way."
"What have you got there?"
"Are you sure?"
"Can I talk to you?"
"Get ready to dive."
"I'm just passing through."
"Don't tell him."
"It's more important."
"I have to train."
"I am his lawyer."
"Talk to me about what?"
"Is that your plan?"
"This is really unfair."
"Are you his wife?"
"Let me think about it."
"It's a bird."
"He likes you."
"Keep your eyes closed."
"I'm doing my best."
"You still are."
"That kind of thing."
"Give him time."
"Where is the kid?"
"I noticed it."
"And he's right."
"Could I talk to you?"
"Are you talking about that?"
"Where did you go?"
"Where did you go?"
"You will feel better."
"It's pretty good."
"We are at home."
"He comes to his senses."
"I can explain it."
"Take care of them."
"My life is over."
"You are quite right."
"Yes, I was."
"Where is your family?"
"It's an antique."
"It will please him."
"This is my gift."
"As it should be."
"We are ahead of schedule."
"You are a woman."
"You are a woman."
"Who is your father?"
"You're not sleeping?"
"Like mother, like daughter."
"Try to remember."
"Can I stay here?"
"Who is the boss?"
"Tell him to come."
"I can fix this."
"I am very touched."
"It's nice here."
"Do you think that's normal?"
"Who is with him?"
"Things are going to change."
"Good, that's good."
"This happens to me often."
"Take another one."
"Go first."
"Go without me."
"It was something else."
"His condition is stable."
"Are you his father?"
"In another life."
"I like women."
"I should have known."
"Do you have an address?"
"Do you have an address?"
"Where do I start?"
"This is a hypothesis."
"Are you going to do it?"
"He has a plan."
"I'm sure of it."
"He is very cute."
"I'm taking the car."
"I was with him."
"This is our job."
"He is an adult."
"Go ahead, take it."
"I know these people."
"Do you have a pen?"
"Are you going to listen to me?"
"Yes, I hope so."
"What are you hiding from me?"
"Do you have any news?"
"Love at first sight."
"It seems so."
"She did that?"
"I didn't notice."
"Sorry to hear that."
"Get her out of here."
"What are you doing here?"
"He is a spy."
"Can't you hear?"
"Can't you hear?"
"I owe him everything."
"It will be easier."
"I cut myself."
"Yes, that's for sure."
"Like this, like that."
"I have a reservation."
"What do you call that?"
"How do you do that?"
"It was my choice."
"What effect does it have?"
"Can I hold it?"
"In a good way."
"You're going to be awesome."
"We have just started."
"It's a bar."
"Do you have one?"
"I read that."
"Do you want to hear it?"
"This place is beautiful."
"Yeah, that's for sure."
"You've come at the right time."
"Thank you, that will be all."
"I love my job."
"We'll think about it."
"Hey, how are you?"
"You are absolutely right."
"Do you have anything else?"
"Come sit here."
"But I know you."
"We are all here."
"I've waited long enough."
"He's a drug dealer."
"This is my partner."
"You're going to get better."
"She is very intelligent."
"Get straight to the point."
"Get straight to the point."
"Would you like some coffee?"
"Yes, you can."
"How do we get there?"
"That is good."
"What did he look like?"
"It's a map."
"So what do you want?"
"We are the best."
"A day or two."
"You were awesome."
"Can't you see it?"
"Do you have any questions?"
"Do you have any questions?"
"Who are you talking about?"
"Is that your answer?"
"This is the beginning."
"We'll talk about it."
"What kind of car?"
"What time was it?"
"And where is she?"
"I love you very much."
"No one knows."
"And what about the money?"
"Is that your name?"
"We were talking about you."
"It's going to be okay."
"I have feelings."
"No, it's over."
"Have you seen me?"
"I'm coming to get the news."
"I have your word?"
"Do I have your word?"
"Thank you for your support."
"Thank you for your support."
"Calm down a little."
"What can I do?"
"Are you the owner?"
"What are you talking about?"
"What kind of questions?"
"I'm going with you."
"She must be there."
"Mom, I love you."
"Once and for all."
"He is online."
"You didn't know that?"
"Excuse me, guys."
"Yes, I have them."
"I appreciate the gesture."
"Did you kiss him?"
"I will come to see you."
"Sorry for the wait."
"No, it's great."
"Nobody loves you."
"No, it was me."
"It's still me."
"That's already good."
"The wedding is canceled."
"No, I have it."
"It's very strong."
"Yes, that suits me."
"I'm on leave."
"All right, go ahead."
"It's a date."
"What does your father do?"
"I want an explanation."
"He always does that."
"Show me your papers."
"This is super cool."
"Yes, that's it."
"Where do you think you're going?"
"Where is your husband?"
"Well, go ahead."
"Where is your friend?"
"Where are my parents?"
"Did you have fun?"
"Did you have fun?"
"Can you understand that?"
"I see the type."
"But it is possible."
"An hour or two."
"He was a man."
"Where does she live?"
"What was he doing here?"
"We are on our way."
"You have guts."
"Where are the bodies?"
"The hearing is open."
"This is genius."
"It wasn't far."
"This should be interesting."
"That's your opinion."
"She needs to rest."
"From everyone."
"What's next?"
"I thought so too."
"Yes, I was there."
"You are my family."
"This is our job."
"Take care of her."
"Yes, it's here."
"No, I didn't know."
"And I like it."
"Not at all, sir."
"You should think about it."
"I trained."
"You have two minutes."
"Keep us posted."
"What is your number?"
"It's a book."
"I called you."
"The decision is made."
"He is our friend."
"You were great."
"I had my reasons."
"Nailed it."
"They are very beautiful."
"Do you know this woman?"
"How much do I owe you?"
"What is this?"
"There is interest."
"Do you still love him?"
"How is it going?"
"I'm looking for something."
"I'm looking for my son."
"I was just there."
"We should talk about this."
"I like you very much."
"He looks like my father."
"Nobody likes me."
"I'm a pro."
"You should be careful."
"I read the newspapers."
"I come here often."
"You wanted it."
"I like it a lot."
"I have a picture."
"It was a piece of cake."
"Mom, are you there?"
"Where does she come from?"
"And for what purpose?"
"Where is the little one?"
"I was told."
"The door is locked."
"What does this have to do with us?"
"You know the drill."
"And that means?"
"I was going to get to that."
"Some tea?"
"Do you believe in God?"
"It goes back a long way."
"You are forgetting one thing."
"How did it start?"
"My time has come."
"Are you going to marry him?"
"And for the others?"
"Did he talk to you?"
"What kind of job?"
"It shouldn't."
"This is your family."
"I'll go talk to him."
"We have a winner."
"I'll make it up to you."
"Look out the window."
"We're good here."
"I loved him so much."
"Can we talk to him?"
"It's a gem."
"What would you have done?"
"Ah, you're here."
"I'm just curious."
"How did you get in?"
"You have a visitor."
"I know, me too."
"I'm on a diet."
"It's your right."
"You're going to like this."
"Tell me his name."
"It was war."
"Are you sleeping with him?"
"He hanged himself."
"I am the director."
"No, I'm staying here."
"How dare he?"
"Do you have his number?"
"Who is it then?"
"Put on speakerphone."
"I've already started."
"It's the only one."
"This is the only one."
"You agreed."
"It was mine."
"Everything is in order."
"This is the best."
"Yes, I hear you."
"I like that."
"Tell me about her."
"I'm looking for you everywhere."
"Are you coming or what?"
"I would like to go there."
"Nobody wants it."
"She's getting married."
"I saw it."
"You fainted."
"She's our daughter."
"What am I doing here?"
"And that's normal."
"All right, that's enough."
"It never happens."
"Get me the police."
"It's the same."
"Come back whenever you want."
"They are very good."
"How many do you want?"
"I want to go back."
"I have several."
"How do you know him?"
"So that was it."
"And where is it?"
"I'm going to kiss you."
"I followed her."
"We can discuss it."
"It's his turn."
"Don't be sorry."
"You should tell him."
"Can I accompany you?"
"That's the principle."
"Yes, we are."
"This is my cell phone."
"I'll give it back to you."
"I will be late."
"I see, I see."
"I can't wait."
"I'm really looking forward to it."
"I just moved in."
"You have to relax."
"Why did you do it?"
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"You understood everything."
"How is life?"
"It must be her."
"I'm going to the bar."
"What was her name?"
"You have to stay here."
"The bathroom."
"Dad, is that you?"
"Who's in there?"
"There's reason to."
"He was with me."
"You have to accept it."
"That's the price."
"The plan has changed."
"You are welcome."
"I came to apologize."
"A little water?"
"Does that mean anything to you?"
"Does that mean anything to you?"
"I turned it off."
"It's a memory."
"The case is closed."
"I know one."
"I noted it."
"I was talking about you."
"I'm so hungry."
"I'll leave it to you."
"I'll leave it to you."
"No, don't say anything."
"You were perfect."
"And what do we do?"
"How is your shoulder?"
"It is our duty."
"Do you want some tea?"
"I have to get dressed."
"He said yes."
"It's so pretty."
"Go in the car."
"Let's go have a drink."
"I know, right?"
"So how was it?"
"He saw us."
"How many do you have?"
"Goodbye, guys."
"I miss you a lot."
"I almost have it."
"I like children."
"Is he with you?"
"It's been a week."
"There is no one there."
"Nobody knew."
"He needs to rest."
"Each one of them."
"Yes, you are."
"Yes you are."
"As much as you want."
"I am a vampire."
"I love my husband."
"Where did she go?"
"Did you believe it?"
"How is your son?"
"Do you have a son?"
"Hey, where are you going?"
"End of the game."
"I trusted you."
"Hold my hand."
"The hearing is suspended."
"Think of something else."
"It was destiny."
"We got married."
"So where are we going?"
"Where did he come from?"
"The one and only."
"Go back up on both sides."
"Where are you from?"
"But where are you going?"
"But where are you going?"
"Like everything else."
"I hear voices."
"Nothing is certain."
"It will have to be done."
"It's still hot."
"Just for you."
"Are you his mother?"
"It's nature."
"Do you like music?"
"I love you so much."
"Are you going to eat that?"
"Not just any one."
"I'm going to the office."
"Give me the phone."
"No, it's too much."
"I have my period."
"How old were you?"
"How old were you?"
"Goodbye and thank you."
"They're coming this way."
"Have you spoken to him?"
"Where are you from?"
"No, I swear."
"Look who it is."
"I have a license."
"Do you believe it?"
"Can I think about it?"
"You are at my house."
"I can't stand it."
"I believe in you."
"He is a professional."
"It was the last one."
"Don't ask questions."
"You can leave now."
"I hope to see you again."
"Keep your cool."
"Are you serious?"
"For the moment, yes."
"I am a federal agent."
"It's going to be dark."
"Did you find it?"
"Did you find it?"
"It looks good."
"It's simple though."
"I have a mission."
"Something like that."
"Much more than that."
"It's so romantic."
"Excuse me for a moment."
"I close the door."
"Yes, it is important."
"I wasn't there."
"It's so simple."
"I'm on guard."
"What are they talking about?"
"What can he do?"
"He is so handsome."
"I finally understood."
"I have a boyfriend."
"You promised me."
"Shall we walk a little?"
"Do you want to meet him?"
"I see you coming."
"Go inside."
"Where is mine?"
"I should know."
"Where are we going to go?"
"So what do we do?"
"If I knew."
"She doesn't understand."
"It never happened."
"Beginner's luck."
"See you on Monday."
"You should thank me."
"Glad to hear it."
"I spoke to them."
"I'm leaving town."
"How do you find it?"
"What are you working on?"
"It pays well."
"It all depends on you."
"Let's go now."
"I can fix everything."
"In the name of what?"
"I am his friend."
"I am a mother."
"Go for a walk."
"Are you from the FBI?"
"Give me your number."
"She agrees."
"You two, with me."
"This is our song."
"What do you want to eat?"
"How do you explain that?"
"How many are left?"
"She drowned."
"I like to hear that."
"It would be with pleasure."
"I found it."
"How are you going to do it?"
"She's a fighter."
"Who is the target?"
"Give me the keys."
"It will be very good."
"This is going to be interesting."
"Did someone ring you?"
"For nothing in the world."
"When did you arrive?"
"When did you arrive?"
"Give me a kiss."
"Give me a kiss."
"It must be here."
"It's that simple."
"They are pros."
"That kind of thing."
"I'm holding on."
"Do you want a hug?"
"I don't know them."
"I know the story."
"He found it."
"Thank you, sir."
"I need them."
"She saw everything."
"I don't dare."
"Give us a minute."
"You weren't there."
"Do you want to get married?"
"Can you hear me?"
"She is one of us."
"No, what is it?"
"I have someone."
"I'm at work."
"It is now."
"It's our turn."
"And that's good."
"How could I have?"
"This is my secret."
"What are your plans?"
"It's going to be okay now."
"The war has begun."
"Thank you for coming."
"Did you follow me?"
"I can understand that."
"That's a good point."
"It's me, Mom."
"Who are you with?"
"What can I get you?"
"As what?"
"I will take care of it."
"That is my intention."
"The water is good."
"I can show you."
"Right now."
"It's a win-win."
"You are making progress."
"Are we going somewhere?"
"Do you want to stay here?"
"She should be there."
"Do you think like me?"
"What did you do?"
"Pull the trigger."
"How does it feel?"
"He should be here."
"Is your husband here?"
"Good for them."
"Do you recognize anyone?"
"But I will."
"This is how we do it."
"This is for you."
"I have a witness."
"It's very tempting."
"That's correct, sir."
"You should talk to him."
"It's a rental."
"It's the same everywhere."
"Goodbye, sweetie."
"I'm in the process."
"It's a picture."
"She's coming with us."
"We need to talk to you."
"It's for her."
"What did he mean?"
"But where are you?"
"Would you like a drink?"
"Are you having a drink?"
"You are all here."
"That's where it comes from."
"What's up, old man?"
"How is your family?"
"Who can say?"
"Something is brewing."
"I know that voice."
"These are mine."
"Now we're even."
"Mom, is that you?"
"It will be better tomorrow."
"He's on the phone."
"Glad to see you again."
"Did you read that?"
"Everything is fine, thank you."
"All this for me?"
"And here is the result."
"They will love you."
"Who do you work for?"
"This is his specialty."
"Go ahead, tell me."
"There it is."
"There, it's said."
"I was doing my job."
"That's my role."
"You were amazing."
"This is the baby."
"You have to be patient."
"Please let me know."
"We'll talk soon."
"It's a detail."
"Do you trust me?"
"It suits you well."
"Don't call me anymore."
"Where do I start?"
"I have to call him."
"I have to go out."
"What did you mean?"
"What did you mean?"
"Try to calm down."
"Try to calm down."
"We have some questions."
"Who were you talking to?"
"How is your mother?"
"Did he touch you?"
"You should be."
"No bad words."
"He apologized."
"Yeah, that's cool."
"Do I know him?"
"You should see this."
"So, how is it?"
"The offer still stands."
"I'll find something else."
"They are downstairs."
"What kind of accident?"
"I have his number."
"I'll pick you up."
"I miss her too."
"No, out of the question."
"It's a prototype."
"Who are you really?"
"Does that make you laugh?"
"He's a customer."
"Do you smell something?"
"I sold it."
"Isn't he cute?"
"I have mine."
"I have mine."
"I'll be quick."
"I found nothing."
"This is my territory."
"Where am I from?"
"I fainted."
"How much do you need?"
"Nice to see you again."
"Nobody likes that."
"Absolutely correct."
"Don't argue."
"That's very clever."
"I'm making an effort."
"I got married."
"This is my city."
"Where is your sister?"
"Stay inside."
"It has already started."
"What's yours?"
"It's hot, huh?"
"Did you know her well?"
"I kissed her."
"You score a point."
"I love my country."
"I still have it."
"I invented it."
"The moment of truth."
"You're going to have fun."
"You already are."
"Give me your bag."
"No, I'm done."
"Do you know this girl?"
"Who are they?"
"You are my husband."
"The cops are here."
"Can we see it?"
"There is one left."
"As good as possible."
"It will never change."
"Anything."
"Do you have any papers?"
"Still no response."
"What is the secret?"
"I take my jacket."
"They take care of it."
"Let's go have some coffee."
"Do you have any proof?"
"You have to be careful."
"Where are they all?"
"I have visions."
"No more than that."
"Who is this boy?"
"We need to."
"No, he's out."
"You stay with me."
"You'll love this."
"What do you think you're doing?"
"I have a brother."
"Give me something."
"I'm getting some fresh air."
"It's very delicate."
"Come home."
"My mother is here."
"What were we talking about?"
"What is the message?"
"I am very happy."
"I am very happy."
"Who wrote it?"
"He is a gentleman."
"It was for me."
"You know the rest."
"All that for that?"
"How did they know?"
"You are very kind."
"How is my wife?"
"Give him time."
"Did you page me?"
"Yeah, I heard."
"I'll hold them back."
"We have a witness."
"I can do anything."
"Where is the commander?"
"It's almost finished."
"You don't see anything?"
"Nobody goes there."
"Have you talked about it?"
"I have a scoop."
"I'll take you there."
"Have you had enough?"
"It's me, sir."
"You need to calm down."
"I liked it."
"Thank you for your understanding."
"What is the price?"
"I'm late."
"Have you seen me?"
"Don't say it."
"A table for two."
"I looked for you."
"There is that."
"This is the hospital."
"I have a gift."
"He has connections."
"And the good news?"
"Let me look at you."
"It's well done."
"I can call him."
"I love this country."
"Yes, it is."
"My father was right."
"I wanted to warn you."
"I wanted to warn you."
"Anyway, thank you."
"This is the house."
"It's your decision."
"Have you seen everything?"
"Can they do that?"
"I'll find him."
"I am an actor."
"Should I call a doctor?"
"I must apologize."
"I was talking about myself."
"Just this once."
"It's a cat."
"It's your business."
"Why did you come?"
"I want it too."
"Who are these guys?"
"I paid for it."
"And what does that give?"
"But where are we?"
"You stay here."
"I would like to meet her."
"It's the holidays."
"I have some."
"What are we doing here?"
"How long will it take?"
"She wants to see you."
"This should be easy."
"I will watch over you."
"Is your mom here?"
"I stopped him."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"Wait, where are you going?"
"What do you call that?"
"Where are they taking him?"
"I don't do it."
"I signed up."
"I keep my promises."
"It works very well."
"Are they still there?"
"We had a great time."
"It's your baby."
"Shall we have a coffee?"
"Twice a day."
"They always do."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"Go ahead, go ahead."
"Stay on your guard."
"See you later, guys."
"Where is the world going?"
"It's your night."
"Have you seen them?"
"It has to be done."
"I'll show him."
"Return to your post."
"I gave it to him."
"It helps me a lot."
"I don't love you."
"You don't know?"
"It's Friday night."
"Do we understand each other?"
"Do you have the key?"
"You are in good shape."
"Thank you, it's good."
"I thought I understood."
"Not thanks to you."
"Something for me?"
"That was our agreement."
"He trusts me."
"I will examine you."
"But that's going to change."
"May God protect you."
"Please continue."
"I wanted to be sure."
"Thank you for helping us."
"No, I'm here."
"What are your intentions?"
"No one is innocent."
"I was there."
"I have the results."
"You are so cute."
"I take my bag."
"I know women."
"I'll keep it."
"I'll stay here."
"I almost forgot."
"If you would like."
"If you want."
"He is somewhere."
"She's going to do it."
"Get some rest."
"And it's you."
"It's a toy."
"She's up there."
"Yes, it was him."
"She's your sister."
"You owe me."
"Don't tell him anything."
"How do you know that?"
"I have to admit it."
"I told you."
"It was well played."
"The show must go on."
"She is in the bathroom."
"This is news."
"I'll meet you outside."
"I want a baby."
"There, it's better."
"Very well, goodbye."
"Do you want a soda?"
"Does he have a record?"
"It's going to be huge."
"It's a war."
"How is your brother?"
"Don't you get it?"
"This is your chance."
"Are you the father?"
"I thought you were gone."
"Spread the word."
"You have good taste."
"It's still there."
"The back door."
"I'll be downstairs."
"What should I say?"
"This is my fiancé."
"I have a visual."
"It's faster."
"The hunt is open."
"We made it."
"Give me a name."
"You know the answer."
"I could do that."
"They just left."
"Do you want a cookie?"
"We'll show them."
"I took the oath."
"He took it."
"That will be all, thank you."
"And what was it?"
"I am a witch."
"One of them."
"But for what purpose?"
"I will do it again."
"I found them."
"We found him."
"I am a hero."
"She's over there."
"I am an adult."
"And who is it?"
"I'm going around."
"Take a closer look."
"So everything is fine."
"Remember me."
"From ancient history."
"My wife is pregnant."
"It's good here."
"She can do it."
"Come inside."
"I can handle it."
"Where are we going now?"
"You are the only one."
"Do you do this often?"
"Do you do this often?"
"In a way, yes."
"Yes, it's you."
"We have to do."
"I will heal you."
"She is an artist."
"Have you read it?"
"She is so beautiful."
"To that extent?"
"Who is with you?"
"It was the best."
"She left us."
"They are right there."
"No, don't go."
"No, don't go."
"I would like to hear it."
"I have a friend."
"He's coming with me."
"I would be happy."
"No more than you."
"It might well be."
"Listen, everyone."
"No, not that one."
"We have to end this."
"Whose is it?"
"So what do I do?"
"He is in the toilet."
"The war is over."
"Do you have a car?"
"He has his account."
"And what do you want?"
"But I'm hungry."
"The money is there."
"Nice to meet you."
"Do you have a daughter?"
"What do you need?"
"What do you need?"
"It's Saturday night."
"Where do you think you are?"
"Now you know."
"Because of you."
"He was my friend."
"It's an investment."
"It was an honor."
"Who is the other one?"
"I work for him."
"He needs to be intubated."
"We'll finish later."
"Did you find them?"
"Did you find them?"
"I'm used to it."
"He's your husband."
"And all the others?"
"I'll let you know."
"I grew up there."
"I should go back."
"What's your excuse?"
"But you were right."
"It depends on the day."
"I have a lot of them."
"Two million dollars."
"Who takes care of it?"
"I organized everything."
"Your time has come."
"What are we talking about?"
"She didn't want to."
"Your mother called."
"What does it mean?"
"This is my number."
"This is that guy."
"Where is the emergency?"
"Where are the reinforcements?"
"It's work."
"You work for me."
"You work for me."
"How is the patient?"
"You should do the same."
"Where did she come from?"
"You and me, together."
"Is this really true?"
"I was delighted."
"Have you eaten yet?"
"She likes me."
"Where were you born?"
"Where is his father?"
"I'm watching over you."
"Who has it?"
"I close my eyes."
"It's probably him."
"How many do you want?"
"For both of them."
"I have everything prepared."
"Do you want to talk to me?"
"Did you know him?"
"I have to leave you."
"So, what do you want?"
"She's no longer there."
"Money first."
"It's very common."
"So, it's decided."
"You swear to me?"
"I'll find out."
"You were great."
"A call for you."
"It was very nice."
"I should have guessed."
"Where did they go?"
"Do you want to follow me?"
"I am aware of that."
"No, I will."
"I'm next door."
"The incident is closed."
"We should do it."
"I would never do that."
"Signs of life?"
"I want that one."
"As far as i know."
"It's so hot."
"That's well said."
"Yes, I like it."
"Yes, thank you."
"I am a doctor."
"This is the best."
"I knew him."
"It's a medicine."
"A door opens."
"This is a guess."
"I owe him that."
"Try to relax."
"Hello to you too."
"She knows something."
"I sent it."
"So, here we go."
"Let's go, let's go."
"A little calm."
"On whose orders?"
"It's pretty here."
"You're not coming in?"
"I defended myself."
"Until tonight."
"I miss him a lot."
"No means no."
"Hi how are you?"
"Can I kiss you?"
"Can I be honest?"
"Well, it depends."
"I will be with you."
"Keep your head up."
"To do what with it?"
"Tell us the truth."
"Where is your bag?"
"Do you know the way?"
"Did you just get back?"
"Do you feel ready?"
"You know the procedure."
"She was your mother."
"I was like you."
"Yes, it's better."
"I feel dizzy."
"And that's fine with me."
"How old was he?"
"Who did this?"
"Come have a drink."
"How do you explain that?"
"You are welcome."
"She was kidnapped."
"You have talent."
"I will accompany you."
"I will accompany you."
"He's my partner."
"Yeah, I saw it."
"Don't drink too much."
"It's your job."
"I would like that."
"This is your dream."
"Okay, see you later."
"He is coming towards us."
"I'm talking about that."
"How are you?"
"We'll meet outside."
"But you are here."
"What do you want from me?"
"Give me your cell phone."
"Take care of them."
"I want you."
"Everything must be perfect."
"The police called."
"It was really good."
"Do you know someone?"
"What do you want to eat?"
"I know you, don't I?"
"What is he going to do?"
"I have clients."
"It was really great."
"I know how to manage."
"This is a clue."
"The discussion is closed."
"Sorry, I forgot."
"I'm cleaning."
"This is my domain."
"She is so cute."
"Thanks for stopping by."
"I have proof."
"There's a chance."
"Don't approach him."
"I really like you."
"It's very touching."
"If only I could."
"Can you describe it?"
"Can you describe it?"
"It looks like it."
"You're so cute."
"Where are my manners?"
"I know the rules."
"I'll take two."
"You didn't do anything."
"Do you really believe that?"
"How do you know him?"
"The train is about to leave."
"Do you really love me?"
"These things happen."
"Try to rest."
"Try to rest."
"Lunch is ready."
"In front of everyone?"
"Is this your dog?"
"Do you read the Bible?"
"How did you guess?"
"It's done."
"Where are my friends?"
"There are plenty of them."
"Lean on me."
"I'm going to be a dad."
"This is her husband."
"Prepare to leave."
"We need to talk about it."
"She is really beautiful."
"It's been two weeks."
"I'm pissed off."
"Who is there?"
"Who are you with?"
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"I still love him."
"What are you doing?"
"Where are the guards?"
"Not far from here."
"Don't be a wimp."
"Do you want more?"
"Goodbye, my son."
"I'll see you there."
"I'll see you there."
"I love my job."
"I love my job."
"He is my friend."
"Do you have his name?"
"What did you eat?"
"It's your life."
"Let me kiss you."
"Get rid of her."
"I'll go check."
"What are they going to do?"
"He's pretty cute."
"What are you playing?"
"How did she do it?"
"I like challenges."
"What have you decided?"
"It had to be done."
"I'll need it."
"Thank you, officer."
"Give me a minute."
"Hey, what's up?"
"That was his name."
"How do you know me?"
"She still is."
"I love this woman."
"You are my family."
"Don't play that game."
"When will I see you again?"
"What does the doctor say?"
"Give me a reason."
"Did you want something?"
"Are you on vacation?"
"What kind of thing?"
"Is this your room?"
"But maybe not."
"Did you kiss her?"
"I'm busy right now."
"We got along well."
"It's a plan."
"Do you want a medal?"
"A little bit anyway."
"It's business."
"I believe in him."
"Can you leave us?"
"Top left."
"I'll pay you back."
"We are safe."
"But I loved him."
"Does she have a name?"
"I have a hunch."
"Can I see you?"
"Where do I put it?"
"Have you been waiting for a long time?"
"Here it is."
"This is your dad."
"The doctor is here."
"Whose is it?"
"No, he's here."
"It's his job."
"Can I touch it?"
"Neither now nor ever."
"I should thank you."
"Where is my sister?"
"Yes, for now."
"You do nothing."
"Are we going swimming?"
"Can I keep this?"
"I would like to see her."
"I'm fine here."
"I'm here."
"No, we can't."
"I would."
"Sorry about your dad."
"It's very successful."
"Do you have anything else?"
"Late for what?"
"The game is over."
"I want to keep it."
"Who's left?"
"Nice to see you."
"You've come at the right time."
"Anyone in particular?"
"I'll call you back."
"The situation is serious."
"I'll create a diversion."
"Oh, you're right."
"How are you going to do it?"
"He is a foreigner."
"Go back inside."
"He is next door."
"Who do you work for?"
"She tastes good."
"She was very beautiful."
"I want to be there."
"Do you know where to go?"
"Do you know where to go?"
"Give me a hint."
"Look on the bright side."
"We have news."
"Is this your boyfriend?"
"The door is there."
"What do you want from him?"
"It's the heat."
"I don't exist."
"You have to live well."
"How do you do that?"
"Thank you for the compliment."
"Do you see this guy?"
"You are very quiet."
"You will listen to me."
"Someone like me?"
"I have an alibi."
"Where is the little one?"
"I was born there."
"It's a marvel."
"And one more thing."
"It's the habit."
"I think it's cute."
"I'm very close."
"I don't do that."
"A gift for you."
"You are very kind."
"Did she talk to you?"
"They are late."
"Do you know her well?"
"We live in a democracy."
"What's his name?"
"Just ask."
"My car is here."
"That's for sure."
"So where are we going?"
"They just arrived."
"Did you invite him?"
"Yeah, I got it."
"See you later."
"Go ahead, man."
"I wanted to talk to him."
"This way, guys."
"Go ahead, tell him."
"So who are you?"
"It was good, wasn't it?"
"It's simpler."
"What is his condition?"
"For money?"
"It's a decoy."
"He is so cute."
"Is that possible?"
"I'm perfectly fine."
"Where are my shoes?"
"Thank you, Your Honour."
"This is my team."
"There are so many of them."
"You forgot that."
"You forgot that."
"Give me that phone."
"That would be nice, wouldn't it?"
"It's very far away."
"It will take a second."
"We grew up together."
"I invited her."
"Thank you for your trust."
"What do you call that?"
"Am I late?"
"No, none of that."
"Go yourself."
"Where did he go?"
"Where did he go?"
"But he left."
"Wait in the car."
"She took it."
"But yes, of course."
"Where is the book?"
"We're coming with you."
"That was the deal."
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"They need it."
"At least, I think so."
"You know what, man?"
"Everyone wins."
"Would you like a coffee?"
"What's up, doctor?"
"What can you do?"
"They are not here."
"Yeah, that's awesome."
"How many are there?"
"I have faith."
"They spotted us."
"This is a clue."
"Can you do it?"
"It's very possible."
"You're not leaving?"
"You'll need it."
"Can you believe it?"
"I owe it to him."
"I know music."
"I left him."
"They are yours."
"Do you have a photo?"
"Do you have a photo?"
"No, I would be surprised."
"Do you have the tickets?"
"I am myself."
"I heard you."
"It could be me."
"That is the question."
"They should be there."
"I have a client."
"How are we going to do it?"
"Are you passing through?"
"We've seen it all."
"But I understood."
"Go take a shower."
"Is anyone hungry?"
"I owe him a lot."
"My life is here."
"I'm willing to try."
"Ladies and gentlemen, good evening."
"He always does."
"Let's get him out of here."
"Who is your boss?"
"This is your mom."
"It won't happen again."
"He kissed me."
"I know a way."
"You're not staying?"
"Are you going to see her again?"
"Such is life."
"What's the story?"
"It's right there."
"What did you get?"
"An hour and a half."
"Go do your homework."
"I know my son."
"I'm taking a bath."
"That's him there."
"I am very impressed."
"Who are you really?"
"I'm hungry."
"Do you like it here?"
"They said that?"
"Why are you here?"
"It's very hot."
"Do you have the money?"
"A date?"
"What does it consist of?"
"It's against nature."
"Go get your things."
"Is that clear enough?"
"We'll call him."
"Good night, children."
"Are you going to see him again?"
"You heard me."
"I know the answer."
"Is she with you?"
"May God protect you."
"He is a doctor."
"Come on, one more time."
"Go inside."
"Have confidence in yourself."
"How could this be possible?"
"I have information."
"Trust me."
"That's exactly it."
"Where do we meet?"
"Have you spoken to them?"
"It seemed fine to me."
"Don't be embarrassed."
"What is he playing at?"
"Give me your coat."
"We have to stay together."
"Where is the door?"
"How do you know each other?"
"That's cool, man."
"Surprised to see me?"
"Nina speaking."
"Are you a cop?"
"I'm always right."
"She is so pretty."
"Can I leave now?"
"For the first time."
"They are all the same."
"The night will be long."
"Come here, come here."
"Come here, come here."
"Have you been waiting for a long time?"
"Don't go there."
"I want to have fun."
"It's on purpose."
"I don't drink anymore."
"How is my baby?"
"I have a class."
"You can be."
"I was leaving."
"I'm doing you a favor."
"I stay with her."
"How is work going?"
"They're coming for you."
"And everything else."
"To what extent?"
"Who could it be?"
"She's fine, thank you."
"It must be true."
"Your place is here."
"It's your money."
"What are my chances?"
"It's been two days."
"This is what happens."
"I'm upstairs."
"You have to concentrate."
"We have a deal."
"Not until now."
"That's his job."
"Take good care of it."
"It's a habit."
"Where did it come from?"
"I'll tell you."
"Where is my watch?"
"One point for you."
"We have a connection."
"I want to redeem myself."
"Is anyone receiving me?"
"Where are you going?"
"Is this a proposal?"
"She will be here soon."
"How long did it last?"
"He was a hero."
"I am a scientist."
"It'll be fine, thanks."
"Can you see me?"
"Where is your dad?"
"A pack of cigarettes."
"But everything will be fine."
"She has character."
"I really hope so."
"What did you see?"
"Are you almost finished?"
"I'll be next door."
"I think it's good."
"These are my orders."
"She trusts me."
"Can you do this?"
"Where is the key?"
"You have a visitor."
"I want them all."
"Let's take a look at this."
"This is the office."
"Leave us a message."
"I misheard."
"Is it that important?"
"Give me a moment."
"He is at my house."
"Okay, buddy."
"I was too."
"I love you."
"What were you going to say?"
"I'm going back."
"No, she's gone."
"Where do you think you're going?"
"No, I have to go."
"I have you."
"No, it's important."
"Do you have a name?"
"Wiggle your big toe."
"It's a wig."
"He's a smart guy."
"You are so kind."
"Does that make you happy?"
"Never say that."
"He is the king."
"I've already been here."
"We'll talk later."
"Who was this woman?"
"He is in town."
"You can count on it."
"Give him time."
"Who cares?"
"I have a request."
"We are a family."
"Are we going to my house?"
"Where is the boat?"
"We'll talk to him."
"I was doing my job."
"You are very talented."
"What if he comes back?"
"I had everything planned."
"We are among friends."
"I want to be free."
"This is my bed."
"Someone spoke."
"Who wants some cake?"
"See you later then."
"I am his sister."
"My offer still stands."
"It's been two years."
"She's coming with me."
"I want a child."
"Where is this girl?"
"What are you working on?"
"Go back to your seat."
"How many do you have?"
"Left, right, left, right."
"This is my neighbor."
"I will give them back to you."
"It was a boy."
"You are my life."
"They are safe."
"I am a professional."
"It's been so long."
"I'll make it work."
"Once or twice."
"It was an order."
"Get into position."
"So I will."
"It starts like this."
"Who will be next?"
"Who doesn't love it?"
"I won again."
"I don't know yet."
"What are we looking for?"
"I lived it."
"What am I doing here?"
"He helped me."
"Let's get to the facts."
"I always do this."
"Why did you come?"
"Who were you talking to?"
"It must be good."
"I know them all."
"We fought."
"Everything seems in order."
"God does not exist."
"And he knows it."
"It's an obsession."
"To both of you."
"Are you all ready?"
"I have witnesses."
"Are you coming or not?"
"I'd like some."
"You are forgetting something."
"Yeah, you know what?"
"Let's start from the beginning."
"Is it really necessary?"
"Where are you at?"
"Will you come with me?"
"Does this suit you?"
"I'll bring her back."
"Are you my mom?"
"I am an American citizen."
"It matters to me."
"The rules are simple."
"Who do we have here?"
"Get out of the car."
"I have to take this."
"Who took it?"
"When will we see each other again?"
"Did I say that?"
"That's class."
"That's very true."
"I'll take the bet."
"We'll see each other again."
"Tell me a story."
"What did they do?"
"I have to be honest."
"I chose you."
"I don't know how."
"Is this reasonable?"
"I was going home."
"I like music."
"I love music."
"Less than a minute."
"I'll come back later."
"She comes to."
"Yes, I believe you."
"Did you ask him?"
"I'll see you tomorrow."
"How was the trip?"
"Yes, I believe it."
"I love my family."
"A little closer."
"Yes, we have it."
"Give me five minutes."
"Give me five minutes."
"Do you understand English?"
"Take your time."
"Where is the helicopter?"
"Who did what?"
"Can you hear me?"
"It's a story."
"I'm so happy."
"It will do the trick."
"It's a nickname."
"I am with them."
"Who are these people?"
"Excuse me for a minute."
"They are your friends."
"Where is my dog?"
"We know each other well."
"He has talent."
"Could I talk to him?"
"We need to talk about this."
"It doesn't work."
"You know I do."
"It's fast."
"That's my theory."
"He will arrive soon."
"I am a gentleman."
"Where did she go?"
"It's his signature."
"They broke up."
"And when was that?"
"We need to talk."
"We have a case."
"It's different now."
"You don't have any?"
"It was so cool."
"I'll give it a try."
"How much do you want?"
"I owe you a lot."
"I followed you."
"What is he looking for?"
"I can feel her."
"I had to leave."
"Thank you for last night."
"I'll let you do it."
"No, I'll be fine, thank you."
"I earn my living."
"I looked for it."
"The moment of truth."
"I have to know."
"Very well, my dear."
"Don't approach him."
"I'll wear it."
"Speak after the beep."
"No, I didn't know."
"That's good, kid."
"Do you want a piece?"
"Is this coffee?"
"This is awesome, man."
"I was delighted."
"It can be."
"Be on time."
"I repeat to you."
"Ah, there you are."
"Yes, see you later."
"But you know that."
"I will find the money."
"Am I scaring you?"
"Are you with us?"
"Do you have any ideas?"
"I take the wheel."
"As I said."
"She stopped."
"Good luck to you."
"Show me your hand."
"Did you believe it?"
"It was really great."
"I learned it."
"Where did they go?"
"It's spring."
"You have my word."
"What did I miss?"
"Nice to meet you."
"They are like us."
"I will follow him."
"He took it."
"He turns around."
"I give it to you."
"When did you get back?"
"Who wants to know?"
"He's a human."
"Yes, he was."
"We're done here."
"Are we going to the cinema?"
"You betrayed me."
"We'll discuss it."
"It's a certainty."
"How is your head?"
"Let it last."
"After all these years."
"I have contacts."
"That's clear."
"Watch where you step."
"I liked it a lot."
"Just you and me."
"Good for me."
"She won't say anything."
"It's really cute."
"I'll go see him."
"Your last name?"
"And the other half?"
"Is this a challenge?"
"It's a rule."
"That's their job."
"Where do we start?"
"That kind of stuff."
"Good night, my dear."
"I think I know why."
"I have to finish this."
"Give me the bag."
"These are fakes."
"I am grateful to you."
"Absolutely true."
"Who sent it?"
"I am a friend."
"Did you get married?"
"Where is the police?"
"How is the girl?"
"Are you doing well?"
"That's probably true."
"You make me laugh."
"I turn around."
"Who is first?"
"Where do I put them?"
"Make good use of it."
"I got married."
"Where does it come from?"
"What would happen?"
"Give me two minutes."
"That's the spirit."
"How do you know her?"
"I am your sister."
"I am your sister."
"Give me back my money."
"You arrive on time."
"Don't ask me."
"You should read it."
"You are my sister."
"No thanks, I'll be fine."
"I'm from here."
"Is this an order?"
"In previous episodes."
"Do you have one?"
"We will do it."
"One of your friends?"
"She was with me."
"You don't think so."
"I hid it."
"We're the good guys."
"Face it."
"We'll see about that."
"Try again."
"There are people."
"He was very kind."
"Do you want proof?"
"That's all there is."
"When did she leave?"
"How do we know?"
"It's hers."
"This is my man."
"I'm just getting started."
"It's very convenient."
"How is your sister?"
"You found me."
"I know how to do it."
"Tell him goodbye."
"She's hiding something."
"And that's me."
"You are under oath."
"You'll get there."
"Let me sort this out."
"I've already left."
"Shall we call the police?"
"It's age."
"Where are we going now?"
"This is so awesome."
"It's all yours."
"I know this guy."
"Keep it to yourself."
"Let's go, come on."
"What do I have?"
"Can you fix it?"
"A while."
"You betrayed us."
"This is the captain."
"It's a robot."
"You are the only one."
"Never two without three."
"Ask him yourself."
"And she's right."
"Good luck with that."
"Do you want a drawing?"
"You are very strong."
"I want his name."
"You have to wake up."
"I'll be there."
"I'll call you tomorrow."
"But where are they?"
"This is unprecedented."
"No, I don't see."
"I am a spy."
"He must be here."
"I want to see you."
"I'll keep it simple."
"I'll take the bet."
"You surprised me."
"You won it."
"What is your price?"
"It's going to be good."
"He is with them."
"Let's go to the hospital."
"Is that me?"
"Come take a look."
"It's going to be okay, Mom."
"It's up there."
"I'll show you around."
"I was ten years old."
"Is he safe?"
"You're lucky."
"She wants to see you."
"Let me handle this."
"I'm going to work."
"Nice to see you again."
"Yes, we know that."
"She was strangled."
"The rules have changed."
"This is my story."
"Isn't that you?"
"So what do I do?"
"It was a girl."
"Yes, what is it?"
"This is a record."
"Where did it happen?"
"Thanks for the information."
"What were you talking about?"
"What number is this?"
"I was there before."
"We should go see."
"I like people."
"I have the keys."
"This is my ex."
"I really loved him."
"But you are here."
"Do you see this man?"
"He was a genius."
"Move over a bit."
"Meet you there."
"We'll find them."
"She's pretty, isn't she?"
"Is this a dream?"
"Oh, that's it."
"Can I get up?"
"It no longer exists."
"It won't last."
"But who is it?"
"What does your husband do?"
"There's nothing left."
"Look at this."
"And who are you?"
"Come have a drink."
"You have mail."
"Are we allowed?"
"When did you arrive?"
"I want to make up for it."
"Go ahead, old man."
"No, I want to know."
"It's an option."
"It never works."
"What is it exactly?"
"Yes, both of them."
"You are his mother."
"It's already better."
"Tell me your name."
"This way for the change."
"Will it be long?"
"Give us a moment."
"He left us."
"As I thought."
"It's beautiful here."
"I will guide you."
"You should think about it."
"Where are you now?"
"I can't come."
"I have proof."
"I'll be at the bar."
"Where is your daughter?"
"I still am."
"Let me do it."
"Nobody says that."
"I will carry you."
"This is my department."
"Where are you going to go?"
"What are you doing now?"
"What are you doing now?"
"What are you doing now?"
"What kind of information?"
"Is it still long?"
"I'm taking a shower."
"Give me a beer."
"I will drive you."
"Where is his room?"
"I've never tried."
"I know people."
"I'm going to class."
"How would you know?"
"I don't drive."
"Like in the movies."
"I have a mandate."
"Someone has to pay."
"What do you want from me?"
"How did he know?"
"I love you more."
"Yes, it's nice."
"You should have called."
"We are adults."
"Do you live around here?"
"It's very small."
"You have guts."
"You have to get up."
"I'm looking for a friend."
"I care about it a lot."
"Put on speakerphone."
"Who needs it?"
"Is this your signature?"
"And you believe it?"
"When is he coming back?"
"I will explain later."
"You have to deal with it."
"Take care of yourself."
"It will soon be dark."
"That's a lot to ask."
"Tell me about it."
"The visit is over."
"Yes, it is."
"Long life and prosperity."
"Do you want to do that?"
"Go first."
"It was very interesting."
"It's just hot air."
"This is his writing."
"She knows too much."
"You are my friends."
"Yes, if you want."
"You called me."
"Keep us posted."
"Sorry, it's closed."
"We already know that."
"It's more prudent."
"Glad to see you."
"Have you read it?"
"No, I have to go home."
"I'll catch it."
"Shall we play a game?"
"I can always try."
"I love this game."
"Are you here already?"
"Worldwide."
"What are you doing?"
"That's good, darling."
"I'm not finished."
"Nobody wants that."
"I did it."
"That's true, sir."
"But you are."
"I'm better now."
"I had to see you."
"That's the secret."
"Will you dance with me?"
"No need to talk."
"Just a moment, just a moment."
"How are you, honey?"
"Do you have a toilet?"
"He will recover."
"Are you thinking about me?"
"If necessary."
"Did you take it?"
"Did you take it?"
"I accept the challenge."
"But she left."
"Maybe for you."
"From now on."
"Do you want to see me?"
"How are the others?"
"He was stabbed."
"His last name?"
"Get her out of here."
"It must be them."
"Where can she be?"
"I'll take over."
"Everything was going well."
"What does it taste like?"
"No, you know what?"
"Is it your birthday?"
"This is the car."
"Is this place taken?"
"Any friends of yours?"
"Any friends of yours?"
"How are you, son?"
"My name is Jarod."
"What are you planning to do?"
"It starts to rain."
"I see it now."
"He was kidnapped."
"Why do you ask that?"
"No need to apologize."
"The call of duty."
"Did you look at yourself?"
"You're a sweetheart."
"I'm talking about myself."
"It's so sudden."
"I kissed him."
"You are hiding something."
"That was my intention."
"How is it done?"
"I read it."
"A hundred years have passed."
"I'll clean this up."
"Didn't have time."
"I owe you everything."
"This is our mission."
"I am your boss."
"Protect me from what?"
"Why do you think that?"
"We have to leave now."
"It could be him."
"The window is open."
"You would have done the same."
"And it happened."
"Pour me a drink."
"I have to leave you."
"Maybe even more."
"You're going to be awesome."
"When will I see you again?"
"Did you find it easily?"
"It will get better."
"I love this car."
"He is on the ground."
"Do you believe me now?"
"Would you like a drink?"
"I live there."
"I found this."
"It's great here."
"What are you working on?"
"Where is the doctor?"
"Hey, where are you going?"
"It's our turn."
"I should talk to him."
"And I know why."
"You have a son."
"What is his story?"
"But I like it."
"But it's great."
"I already love him."
"You helped me."
"Use this."
"You are very brave."
"Do you have the time?"
"I oppose it."
"I'm waiting."
"I'll pass it to you."
"It will be."
"You're changing the subject."
"You're my friend."
"Nobody has any."
"You are a girl."
"It's by birth."
"I'll take the orders."
"I have to think about it."
"Did you understand correctly?"
"It was the truth."
"He surrendered."
"I take command."
"I love this job."
"I will leave."
"Somewhere around there."
"I dreamed of you."
"Yes, she is here."
"When will he come back?"
"No thanks to you."
"Where is your master?"
"Yes, I must."
"Dad, can you hear me?"
"I'll do without it."
"Have you seen yourself?"
"A letter for you."
"Thank you for accepting."
"The matter is settled."
"That's good, keep going."
"Where do I put this?"
"I hear things."
"Let me see her."
"I helped you."
"Where is it at?"
"Yes, she was."
"Is there any coffee left?"
"Yeah, you're right."
"You fainted."
"Where have you been?"
"What happened to them?"
"We have to find them."
"We made it."
"Can I withdraw?"
"Come live with me."
"Everything has an end."
"But I forgive you."
"I have a signal."
"Whose is it?"
"I've been waiting for this moment."
"What is needed."
"I understand, I understand."
"Do you have a wife?"
"Thank you for having me."
"It's up there."
"I did it."
"I made it."
"You are so cute."
"He is so small."
"The count is correct."
"You don't like it?"
"They got me."
"Can I take it?"
"Have you noticed?"
"It's an adventure."
"Not as much as you."
"The front door."
"And I loved him."
"I'm still hungry."
"We have to see each other."
"You promised me."
"That's good."
"And for the rest?"
"What are you going to say?"
"He wants to marry me."
"You are always right."
"It's beautiful here."
"The answer is simple."
"Yes, I like it."
"Yes, I like it."
"He is traveling."
"I'm in good shape."
"It suits him well."
"It's like new."
"It's very curious."
"Is this real?"
"To everyone."
"Hence my presence."
"It's a reflex."
"Not for a while."
"And who am I?"
"He's used to it."
"You have ten minutes."
"What do you work in?"
"The kitchen is closed."
"Do you have a moment?"
"It might be useful."
"Well, you know what?"
"Each of us."
"Can you see it?"
"It's my nature."
"It's an impression."
"I await your reply."
"Wait in the car."
"Is it the money?"
"At sunset."
"I swear to God."
"He saw me."
"This is quite important."
"This is really interesting."
"My turn."
"Hal, do you read me?"
"A message for you."
"No, that's nice."
"Have you spoken to them?"
"Are you almost finished?"
"It's a real one."
"Do you want war?"
"You don't know?"
"Near the window."
"Go ahead, say it."
"I know people."
"Yes, right now."
"This is an advantage."
"Thank you for this evening."
"Is this your mother?"
"It's your idea."
"When did he leave?"
"I am honored."
"What if I win?"
"She is so beautiful."
"It's very heavy."
"I have been watching you."
"I'll show them."
"You are very intelligent."
"You look beautiful."
"She saw it."
"Give us a minute."
"It's a gamble."
"Give me a cigarette."
"Line up."
"He wants to see me."
"No more than you."
"They all do it."
"But yes, but yes."
"I'll bring it to you."
"Where are you calling from?"
"Yes, it's me."
"Tell him the truth."
"Haven't you noticed?"
"Can you stand up?"
"We are a team."
"We do it together."
"It will be without me."
"How does it open?"
"How did they do it?"
"Do you have any plans?"
"I was hot."
"So, do you like it?"
"Something big."
"He must be there."
"Well, maybe."
"Do we have a name?"
"Yes, I know that."
"Not in this case."
"Have you seen him again?"
"I love you so much."
"The game is over."
"No, I know."
"And what are you doing?"
"And what do you do?"
"Are you in charge of it?"
"The police came."
"It's down there."
"Where is the list?"
"What is your situation?"
"It's pretty cool."
"I am with her."
"You are a soldier."
"The police are here."
"Where should I sign?"
"It was his."
"What was he doing there?"
"Yes, I was there."
"How did you get out?"
"How are you, brother?"
"You are so handsome."
"Do you have a child?"
"That means no."
"Do you have a license?"
"See for yourself."
"I have eyes."
"She doesn't speak."
"It's okay, darling."
"Thank you for the support."
"This is the solution."
"Make good use of it."
"I was looking for you everywhere."
"I am the owner."
"And these two?"
"They are monsters."
"We were almost there."
"You are a star."
"You are here now."
"Is this your friend?"
"When did you get back?"
"It was my job."
"You have your orders."
"I listened to him."
"I have some too."
"What kind of business?"
"It's very hot."
"So what do you want?"
"There are two left."
"What were we talking about?"
"I can't."
"We'll be there soon."
"Take care of that."
"That would have surprised me."
"It's our business."
"Thank you for staying."
"What is your address?"
"Have you watched it?"
"I knew."
"Where is the tape?"
"I'll warm you up."
"Do you want some too?"
"Do you play sports?"
"That's a good idea."
"It will be an honor."
"I am the captain."
"What is the code?"
"It goes without saying."
"Give me your coat."
"Oh, I'm fine."
"I will pray for you."
"Where are you taking him?"
"A little faster."
"How long has this been going on?"
"You are his father."
"Where is our son?"
"He wanted to talk to you."
"Let me talk to them."
"When do we see each other?"
"People are looking at us."
"You are my sister."
"You should be."
"No, it's normal."
"There, that's me."
"What was it then?"
"It was really nice."
"Back to normal."
"How could I know?"
"These are the facts."
"I understood that."
"Stick around."
"I think it's cool."
"He has his reasons."
"Thank you and goodbye."
"I'm fine, Dad."
"You are still young."
"I waited for you."
"You are capable of it."
"You are very strong."
"I know a guy."
"Am I clear?"
"I kept my word."
"You found me."
"Do you remember?"
"We have a plan."
"Come on, see you later."
"Let me tell you."
"Let me tell you."
"I found her."
"I get up early."
"How is your hand?"
"It's really cool."
"He was so kind."
"Spread the word."
"Give me your phone."
"He betrayed us."
"He was like that."
"Nice to meet you."
"We had fun."
"We want to talk to you."
"So what are you doing?"
"What does she look like?"
"What does she look like?"
"I know this girl."
"I'm almost ready."
"I was assaulted."
"We're going to be rich."
"What do you want to hear?"
"I want to thank you."
"How many are left?"
"Ah, that's good."
"You have to go back."
"You can keep it."
"Let there be light."
"It was a secret."
"I have a key."
"You have to believe it."
"Go inside."
"I know you."
"What did you say?"
"Where is the drug?"
"What day is it?"
"Are you having a drink?"
"Let me fix this."
"What are you doing here?"
"Take off his handcuffs."
"How did it work?"
"Mom wants to talk to you."
"This is so cool."
"How's work going?"
"It's chocolate."
"What do you mean?"
"It was one."
"I wanted to call you."
"Are you watching TV?"
"He's a fighter."
"Did you call them?"
"For you, maybe."
"I am one of you."
"They are people."
"End of conversation."
"I believe so, yes."
"It comes from me."
"It's summer."
"I thought we were friends."
"I am in mourning."
"Do you know the way?"
"Did you do it?"
"Did you do it?"
"Can we keep it?"
"You say that now."
"I'll take him."
"Do you like it here?"
"Where is your friend?"
"Really, I'm fine."
"It's my party."
"Sorry, everyone."
"I have my orders."
"But he's fine."
"He is a witness."
"The situation is delicate."
"I have an address."
"Of course, with pleasure."
"Are you letting him go?"
"Thank you for the call."
"He's up to something."
"Thank you for accompanying me."
"Do you have the address?"
"Hold on to me."
"No need to talk about it."
"It is your duty."
"That's interesting."
"Have you seen everything?"
"What does your father do?"
"You're doing it right."
"Nobody comes here."
"Have you thought about it?"
"Will you remember it?"
"I was going to bed."
"Excuse me, who are you?"
"Here is the proof."
"He just called."
"Give me a moment."
"I can feel them."
"It's been an hour."
"I loved you."
"Is this your plan?"
"I'll walk you home."
"This is very cool."
"I can teach you."
"No, far from it."
"What are our options?"
"It must be buried."
"Can I go?"
"It's a loan."
"We have one."
"I'm waiting for a response."
"No, don't move."
"You are absolutely right."
"I didn't look."
"Let's get going."
"You're probably right."
"We have a contract."
"I am in place."
"Well, thank you very much."
"I have to see them."
"You have to say it."
"I believed you."
"Do you have his number?"
"Where is the old man?"
"First door on the left."
"I'm going back to the office."
"See you next time."
"It's me."
"Can I keep them?"
"Can he do that?"
"We must warn them."
"Have you identified it?"
"And he disappeared."
"Yes, it shows."
"Attention, everyone."
"What is your opinion?"
"Where are you taking me?"
"I can do it again."
"This is the father."
"Do you have a brother?"
"That says it all."
"First come, first served."
"Are you a friend?"
"Your identity card."
"He's a good-looking guy."
"This is the place."
"You know the music."
"What do you want to eat?"
"You can't read?"
"And you were right."
"Come have a drink."
"It's a treat."
"Sorry about all this."
"Time for what?"
"Thank you for your support."
"We are friends."
"He is very attractive."
"What do we do?"
"You didn't have to."
"But it's me."
"Welcome to the party."
"Tony, it's me."
"It's okay, baby."
"Who wants coffee?"
"What is your offer?"
"I'll let you do it."
"If you wish."
"Who did you see?"
"He is very sensitive."
"You can take it."
"Want to try it?"
"She has talent."
"Do you really want it?"
"You're forgetting something."
"He is a doctor."
"She saw me."
"See you outside."
"It's brand new."
"That's the deal."
"I'll be there soon."
"Where are your shoes?"
"I'm at the office."
"Give me your opinion."
"I love this stuff."
"This is that girl."
"They are the same."
"You're going to be fine."
"Someone came in."
"Back off, everyone."
"How did you know?"
"You will know soon."
"Don't call him."
"Let's go home."
"Do you want some milk?"
"Did you buy it?"
"You surprised me."
"The session is over."
"Thank you for your visit."
"They are going to get married."
"Yes, it's him."
"I like that."
"It's your wedding."
"Come dance with me."
"They are so cute."
"Can you talk to him?"
"We have a call."
"I am now."
"Nobody does that."
"You need to rest."
"I will do what is necessary."
"Serves him right."
"He had planned everything."
"When is the wedding?"
"Where are you taking him?"
"This is progress."
"I want children."
"Now what do we do?"
"I will find the way out."
"Are you sleeping with her?"
"That's it."
"That's done."
"Can I tell him?"
"Do you have any leads?"
"Please exit the vehicle."
"The tea is ready."
"Did you feel it?"
"You will find something."
"I don't accept."
"We'll take care of it."
"Merry Christmas everyone."
"Twice a week."
"I open the door."
"Do you want to take it?"
"Who is this gentleman?"
"Keep that to yourself."
"I will watch over him."
"Let's lay our cards on the table."
"Yes, I will tell him."
"Where are my pants?"
"Do you have a dog?"
"It's very personal."
"There are three left."
"And you guys?"
"You have to decide."
"Do not judge me."
"I have a patient."
"She had to leave."
"Who is your source?"
"I'm really fine."
"I'll show you around."
"You're almost there."
"We do our job."
"What more can be done?"
"I really like you."
"Give me time."
"Give me time."
"Stay inside."
"Yes, maybe so."
"Where did it come from?"
"That's the whole story."
"Yes, it's beautiful."
"You'll pay for it."
"Let me introduce myself."
"Where are you going?"
"Potatoes."
"That's perfect, thank you."
"Like what, for example?"
"Are you seeing someone?"
"Yes, it was."
"What remains?"
"As soon as I can."
"I worked late."
"I came to see you."
"I really have to go."
"Let's take a look."
"Do you have coffee?"
"Do you think this is normal?"
"This is my wedding."
"I have the answer."
"We're among ourselves."
"I'm coming to see you."
"Did I have a choice?"
"Sorry for my delay."
"Was it really necessary?"
"He kept his word."
"I know the type."
"I love my life."
"Did you touch it?"
"My father is here."
"Let's go eat something."
"You must be strong."
"I did it."
"Just a moment."
"It will be a pleasure."
"What do I know?"
"How can this be?"
"Up the stairs."
"She got me."
"These are my parents."
"This could be fun."
"Why are you here?"
"Where are my men?"
"Yes, that makes sense."
"Let me accompany you."
"You owe me this."
"Let me take this."
"It was a coincidence."
"Have you been good?"
"It's a success."
"A little to the left."
"Yes, we are."
"She was his wife."
"She was like that."
"I'll tell you everything."
"Are we going to your place?"
"What exactly do you do?"
"A lot of things."
"Let me see that."
"I accept your offer."
"I don't know."
"Sir, can you hear me?"
"Do you want to marry him?"
"Be nice to her."
"Is this your family?"
"Where is the boss?"
"Is this really true?"
"You should relax."
"He was poisoned."
"Thanks, anyway."
"No, you stay here."
"Who else knows?"
"It's emotion."
"How was your trip?"
"I'm trying to think."
"I didn't want to."
"I had to do."
"You two stay here."
"I'll go first."
"My name is Ben."
"You are really beautiful."
"You are truly beautiful."
"So that's it?"
"I'll send it to you."
"I should do it."
"Can't you guess?"
"He makes me laugh."
"That's enough, guys."
"I had fun."
"We need more."
"It's a mess."
"I am his uncle."
"I can defend myself."
"I knew it well."
"I'm here, Mom."
"Not in this way."
"Go back to your room."
"That would be very kind."
"Can you feel it?"
"We are men."
"Have you been here before?"
"I would like to see them."
"I would be honored."
"Do you have someone?"
"Can anyone confirm?"
"She is so young."
"This is my offer."
"He confessed everything."
"How is my son?"
"This is a solution."
"Do you believe in destiny?"
"This is my client."
"Good night, my love."
"I'll tell you again."
"I have my pride."
"You're hiding something."
"It will take a minute."
"No, it's serious."
"You are an adult."
"I would have known."
"It must be."
"And where are you going?"
"How are the girls?"
"Do you already know each other?"
"You can count on it."
"My wife is waiting for me."
"I loved him so much."
"Did you go there?"
"Do you realize?"
"Yeah, it is."
"Footsteps."
"It was an honor."
"It will go faster."
"I'll check that out."
"You did the right thing."
"That's really nice."
"Someone will come."
"It's the cops."
"Hey, you know what?"
"Lean forward."
"Unless what?"
"Great work, guys."
"My God, are you okay?"
"Are you from here?"
"No one will see it."
"You all know that."
"Yes, I see her."
"Have you read this?"
"It's our money."
"Where is his body?"
"Everything was going so well."
"Yes, it's you."
"Yes, I'm done."
"I prefer not to."
"Do you think it's good?"
"No, I don't agree."
"Give me something."
"But it's cool."
"I must have been dreaming."
"Is this normal?"
"I am his sister."
"So where are we going?"
"Come back in an hour."
"This is justice."
"He will hear you."
"Sorry to wake you up."
"Guys, guys."
"I want to see him again."
"Where did she come from?"
"There is one left."
"You know that perfectly well."
"She will know what to do."
"She's a pro."
"I know the law."
"Where are your friends?"
"Do you have any idea?"
"That must be nice."
"Yes, everything is ready."
"What are you doing, man?"
"Thank you for your kindness."
"If you insist."
"She is too good."
"What are we playing?"
"Why are you asking that?"
"Get her out of there."
"But he was there."
"What are our chances?"
"But I have changed."
"You don't work?"
"You don't work?"
"Come, I beg you."
"Will you give me some?"
"Do you want chicken?"
"Return to your post."
"They called me."
"I like girls."
"I was talking about you."
"You need to calm down."
"Go to your room."
"Are you planning to stay for a long time?"
"Do you have a boyfriend?"
"We'll get them."
"What are you doing outside?"
"Are these your children?"
"What do you call him?"
"I'll eat later."
"She likes you."
"What should we do?"
"Let's hope it works."
"Where is the bag?"
"I've been better."
"I liked you."
"Give him the money."
"Where is he now?"
"Be honest with me."
"She has guts."
"I love this moment."
"Where is your room?"
"I want to meet her."
"Who's up there?"
"When I'm done."
"I want details."
"I am a thief."
"We've had enough."
"I'm on edge."
"Well, go ahead."
"It's a contract."
"Do me this favor."
"Let me accompany you."
"Don't tell me that."
"I think so, yes."
"This is my taxi."
"Glad to be here."
"You agreed."
"It's the phone."
"Everything has a price."
"I met her."
"Where is the rock?"
"Now it's done."
"What did he look like?"
"It's quiet here."
"Nowhere in particular."
"Good luck, buddy."
"Of course, my dear."
"Another time, then."
"Do you have your passport?"
"I will go on foot."
"I'm all in."
"And tell him what?"
"Oh, he's here."
"This is your room."
"You can always dream."
"May God protect us."
"I know how to do it."
"It was very brave."
"Ask yourself the question."
"Where are you going?"
"I sincerely hope so."
"See you soon, I hope."
"We'll find them."
"I was in the bathroom."
"I bought them."
"Who are you?"
"Is everything okay, madam?"
"She has something."
"You can have it."
"No, I think so."
"But it worked."
"I'll come back for you."
"Something to eat?"
"See for yourself."
"That's a paycheck."
"I brought it back."
"Where is the letter?"
"Can you replace me?"
"Dad is back."
"Give me an example."
"That is the question."
"We meet here."
"What did you mean?"
"You're going to be great."
"Yeah, sort of."
"It's a race."
"I live across the street."
"Everything's fine then."
"Do you see this girl?"
"I have to answer."
"What were you doing there?"
"Don't you have anything better?"
"Who invited him?"
"Are you going on a trip?"
"Don't be late."
"We're going to question him."
"They will arrive soon."
"Until further notice."
"Can I have it?"
"Get in the truck."
"No, let me do it."
"Do you have the time?"
"It was a game."
"Where is his office?"
"Do you want the money?"
"But time is running out."
"I wanted to surprise you."
"Return to base."
"And what does it do?"
"It's time."
"I am a person."
"I was just wondering."
"I'll make a note of it."
"I am an actress."
"She's coming this way."
"What's the weather like?"
"He has an alibi."
"I should thank you."
"He's right here."
"Get to work."
"Cover your ears."
"We'll do without it."
"I must warn you."
"It can't be."
"I am his fiancée."
"What is your verdict?"
"It was a miracle."
"No, let's go."
"He loves you very much."
"We have to tell him."
"My name is Hank."
"You're an angel."
"I had one."
"I know them all."
"Do you have proof?"
"It's an event."
"Who took it?"
"Can you take me?"
"Can you take me?"
"How are things here?"
"Do you smell that?"
"He saw it."
"Because I don't."
"She woke up."
"It's a poem."
"I want to accompany you."
"It's an airplane."
"Don't you believe?"
"Don't tell them anything."
"Welcome to Los Angeles."
"How do you find me?"
"Oh, not at all."
"Would you have a cigarette?"
"It's adrenaline."
"We'll have to wait."
"She was my friend."
"Did you feel that?"
"I'll try it."
"You are part of it."
"I know a guy."
"It's his business."
"They are very kind."
"They stopped."
"Where are you planning to go?"
"So, see you later."
"He's your cousin."
"You would have done the same."
"How do you find me?"
"Can you call me back?"
"He's holding up."
"You are my hero."
"I'm waiting for that."
"You said no."
"So, is it yes?"
"What are your plans?"
"How are you, boy?"
"But you know that."
"What is your profession?"
"It's pretty."
"It was a metaphor."
"He's a friend."
"I am resting."
"It's going to be cool."
"I will come back for you."
"I can hear you breathing."
"Go ahead, open it."
"Are you a parent?"
"Oh, that's wonderful."
"It's totally different."
"You can do anything."
"Where is the food?"
"Do you want to hold it?"
"I was surprised."
"I'm doing research."
"History repeats itself."
"He is a god."
"I have two daughters."
"Do you have the address?"
"It's been three days."
"They all look the same."
"It looks like this."
"He trapped us."
"I got them."
"Do you have luggage?"
"And on your side?"
"No, it was good."
"Did you call him?"
"What is your goal?"
"She came here."
"I love my job."
"Ah, here we are."
"You are in good shape."
"I love this passage."
"He goes home."
"I'm going up there."
"I accepted it."
"Give me your arm."
"His days are numbered."
"And for what purpose?"
"Who are these guys?"
"Let's go have a coffee."
"Like every night, Minus."
"We'll have to."
"I know that perfectly well."
"Ready to go?"
"We must work together."
"And who is it?"
"I have to see you."
"He will be here tomorrow."
"I'm trying."
"Just like home."
"You were able to come."
"I love weddings."
"Where is my lawyer?"
"We are making progress."
"I like you very much."
"I'm talking about us."
"Sue me."
"As you feel."
"Maybe you should."
"We are on our way."
"We love you too."
"I told him."
"Hey, wait a minute."
"Where are your things?"
"Give me your opinion."
"Don't call me."
"Is it really him?"
"It was the police."
"You can relax."
"But that's normal."
"No, that's correct."
"I have to join him."
"It was one less."
"Do you have his number?"
"What do they want from me?"
"I'm staying online."
"Where is the briefcase?"
"I'll call you back soon."
"I have your money."
"You heard them."
"I fixed it."
"Do you need it?"
"Speaking of which."
"This is our life."
"She likes him."
"Where is your home?"
"We'll see him."
"Do you want to do it?"
"You have your answer."
"A little dignity."
"How did you know?"
"It's on the left."
"Who is behind this?"
"You are the boss."
"You're leaving tonight."
"I woke up."
"What are the rules?"
"Who is the best?"
"Who are we talking about?"
"Yes, they are there."
"Where are you going now?"
"Thank you for the gift."
"Completely normal."
"Come on, let's do it."
"He did well."
"Where is the cat?"
"He's your boss."
"The door is blocked."
"How can I know?"
"I'm so excited."
"How's your head?"
"It's hiding something."
"You're a man."
"I will set you free."
"Where is the newspaper?"
"So, what does it give?"
"This is the one."
"Thanks for the trip."
"It's been months."
"Have you ever tried it?"
"Yeah, it'll be fine."
"No one deserves this."
"Where is the proof?"
"You said it."
"You are a thief."
"She didn't know."
"Where is your family?"
"I'm at work."
"No one will."
"I'll take one."
"No, that's correct."
"She must be here."
"Do you want children?"
"It will never happen."
"I don't have anything better."
"Where is your girlfriend?"
"They are up there."
"How is your daughter?"
"How is your daughter?"
"I'll take that one."
"Who wants some tea?"
"Have you seen her again?"
"Ask me a question."
"Did you tell them?"
"Do we have an address?"
"Shall we change the subject?"
"We are on a mission."
"This is ideal."
"How does he know?"
"Did you want to see us?"
"We can fix this."
"What are we doing here?"
"Is he still there?"
"You've grown so much."
"Have you seen it?"
"This is my arm."
"It's like me."
"Didn't you see?"
"The time has come."
"Who are you then?"
"How dare you?"
"And where are they?"
"I helped her."
"You can do better."
"She's a client."
"She is really pretty."
"Where are we going?"
"I have to see this."
"Yes, it's amazing."
"Once a week."
"It was good, huh?"
"Take another one."
"I didn't know."
"What is his number?"
"Who is it from?"
"OK, that's good."
"Thanks for the ride."
"He was telling the truth."
"Are you happy now?"
"You have five minutes."
"I propose a toast."
"I want the money."
"Yes, I love it."
"Yes, it was great."
"I can pay you."
"I spotted it."
"How do you explain this?"
"I finished it."
"I'm all excited."
"I am very excited."
"Then he left."
"Did someone come?"
"Is my wife here?"
"Thank you for your hospitality."
"It worked well."
"Goodbye, my dear."
"Not a good idea."
"That's it, man."
"That's true, what."
"She loves you very much."
"Try to remember."
"Try to remember."
"Almost everyone."
"I am so proud."
"Where are you calling from?"
"That's cool."
"He has a daughter."
"Fingers crossed."
"You've really changed."
"I will watch over her."
"They are on board."
"It was a question."
"Put it in a safe place."
"It's a church."
"I have to thank you."
"Each of you."
"She is so cute."
"He has your eyes."
"You know the type."
"Who is with her?"
"Are these yours?"
"She betrayed us."
"Oh, I forgot."
"I was thinking of you."
"No need to apologize."
"Yeah, I know that."
"Thank you for your trust."
"No sign of them."
"I have money."
"No, I like it."
"Not to our knowledge."
"Let's get this over with."
"I am very well."
"Give us a minute."
"They took her."
"You asked for it."
"Should I calm down?"
"How is your arm?"
"Do you think you know me?"
"Good for us."
"I'll tell you everything."
"Where is the shooter?"
"Dad, what are you doing?"
"Can you believe that?"
"Guess who's here."
"Good night, girls."
"I want that one."
"You are like me."
"It's my stomach."
"With or without you."
"Something is happening."
"We're going to have a good laugh."
"Will you let me in?"
"Yes, I swear."
"I created it."
"Do you have a date?"
"I'll send it to you."
"I want to thank you."
"If you allow it."
"I'll stop you."
"Go to the back."
"It's a fortress."
"What are my options?"
"Have you had enough?"
"You don't see anything?"
"You don't know?"
"I was watching TV."
"Do you care?"
"I like your style."
"She's for you."
"Las Vegas Police."
"Do you want to go eat?"
"I was wondering."
"Come to my room."
"Like you and me."
"You don't speak?"
"Give me the map."
"This is extremely important."
"You're next."
"I have an interview."
"You have one week."
"Stay a little longer."
"It must be said."
"I will come back tonight."
"You owe me."
"It seems so."
"It seems so."
"They are really good."
"I commit to it."
"It looks like it."
"I'll walk you back."
"How is my father?"
"So what was it?"
"Are you looking for work?"
"Yes, I want it."
"Where is the truck?"
"How are you, little one?"
"Just a little bit more."
"It's a facade."
"Just the three of us."
"Give me that thing."
"And I understood."
"Can you open it?"
"Join me."
"Join me."
"I'll take them all."
"Safety first."
"What is the truth?"
"He's a policeman."
"When can you start?"
"And I would do it again."
"I'm in town."
"They are so beautiful."
"It's the jungle."
"It's French."
"Try to relax."
"He will change his mind."
"Yes, that would be great."
"It's all over now."
"What were you thinking?"
"What do you call that?"
"Who are you thinking of?"
"It's going to be easy."
"How does he do that?"
"I have to take him."
"We have a visual."
"Glad to hear it."
"You two, follow me."
"And he loves me."
"I just wanted to know."
"She spoke to me."
"What did he take?"
"We are friends."
"It's pretty quiet."
"I've been through this."
"It's kind of cute."
"What is your theory?"
"He fought."
"I really believe it."
"No sudden movements."
"How is your leg?"
"I'm going on a trip."
"People need to know."
"Good night, my angel."
"How are the boys?"
"I have ideas."
"What was he talking about?"
"Just water."
"You're forgetting one thing."
"He's doing well."
"It's very recent."
"Who are you again?"
"Yes, I can."
"Yes, that's normal."
"Serves you right."
"I was married."
"I love your dress."
"You had to do it."
"My car is outside."
"It's a tumor."
"Give me a minute."
"Where did you study?"
"Well, that's good."
"But I will try."
"No, you don't understand."
"It's very reassuring."
"Where is your cell phone?"
"Yes, he is right."
"You should ask him."
"Access is prohibited."
"How do you feel?"
"We take my car."
"You have to let it go."
"I find it fascinating."
"Nobody cares."
"She doesn't sleep."
"It's absolutely perfect."
"Tell him to wait."
"Tell him to wait."
"That's all I do."
"It's a house."
"We'll go see."
"She is with him."
"I'll give it back to you."
"What else do you want?"
"Can I kiss him?"
"I came here."
"It could be good."
"I'll come by later."
"It's a mobile."
"Quick and easy."
"Don't you notice anything?"
"What did I say?"
"Pull the trigger."
"There's something new."
"Did you want something?"
"Can you leave us?"
"I'm going to work."
"My father is sick."
"Are you the doctor?"
"But I like it."
"The store is closed."
"He was a cop."
"She is very close."
"You can be proud."
"It's a kidnapping."
"I will go with you."
"Let's take action."
"Where have you been?"
"I am very calm."
"How do you explain that?"
"None of them."
"How much do you need?"
"I touch wood."
"Let me talk to you."
"You're going to be a dad."
"Thanks for listening."
"But yes, but yes."
"They are the best."
"Did she leave you?"
"Sorry to hear that."
"We are pros."
"Who decided that?"
"Yes, she's right."
"You are a machine."
"I'll call you soon."
"I believe it."
"I was on the phone."
"Nobody likes him."
"Yes, absolutely."
"This would be a first."
"Do you want a tissue?"
"Are you going to bed?"
"It was my birthday."
"How do you know each other?"
"Did you wait long?"
"You've grown up a lot."
"Where are the men?"
"It had to be done."
"I wrote everything down."
"I thought about it."
"Are you coming to my house?"
"I am still young."
"This is the guy."
"I want results."
"He is a lawyer."
"You have three minutes."
"How was your evening?"
"What's happening to you?"
"Have a good trip."
"He's like you."
"Well, I do."
"Give me your number."
"They got us."
"What does all this mean?"
"Let me do this."
"How many do you have?"
"Who is his father?"
"You should have come."
"How was the party?"
"How are you up there?"
"That will be all, gentlemen."
"Good luck, my friend."
"I dreamed about it."
"I have needs."
"Where is my glass?"
"Yes, you know it."
"How would he know?"
"Where do they come from?"
"Where do they come from?"
"No one is following us."
"More than usual."
"How did they do it?"
"Did you have fun?"
"This must be it."
"You know how to do it."
"She'll get there."
"I think so."
"She's hemorrhaging."
"I hope so."
"How do you plan to do this?"
"He has something."
"Did you write it?"
"He's your uncle."
"Thank you for your support."
"Who authorized this?"
"This is an example."
"Give me a drink."
"I always knew."
"This is my style."
"It's very deep."
"Does this happen to you often?"
"Call me back later."
"Do you remember?"
"He wants to meet you."
"I'm still working on it."
"Who were these people?"
"I want it now."
"Two and a half years."
"Why do you have this?"
"It's a formality."
"You will change your mind."
"From A to Z."
"She's holding up."
"It's been three years."
"No one will see us."
"Where is the kid?"
"A little bit, yes."
"Are you the manager?"
"I entrust it to you."
"I entrust it to you."
"I entrust it to you."
"This is our motto."
"What is your answer?"
"How did they get in?"
"It's a victory."
"I helped him."
"What would be the point?"
"It's his home."
"It's a hotel."
"Have a good time."
"Yes, I assure you."
"That's quite enough."
"I don't know exactly."
"I have to admit it."
"What were you going to say?"
"I was counting on it."
"Does it really matter?"
"No one can enter."
"I was clear."
"What are you talking about?"
"We are family."
"The honor is yours."
"She left."
"It's a diversion."
"He is capable of it."
"She is so small."
"I have to get up."
"You're safe."
"I followed you."
"I followed you."
"How did they know?"
"Who is it, darling?"
"That's right, Dad."
"Yes, it's beautiful."
"Where is the video?"
"Go back to the car."
"You won't leave."
"This is really lovely."
"Oh, here we are."
"I'm talking about you."
"I want to kiss you."
"They are preparing something."
"Oh, it's me."
"Why are you talking to him?"
"I was just thinking about that."
"I loved it."
"What is he doing here?"
"That's it, yes."
"Do you have any friends?"
"You were my friend."
"How could I know?"
"It really is."
"She is so kind."
"I like the idea."
"And who are they?"
"I will write it."
"Yes, I see them."
"I'm getting married tomorrow."
"How do you find it?"
"I am short."
"We have plenty of them."
"I love your daughter."
"Should we go there?"
"And I will be there."
"Take a look."
"What am I thinking?"
"What do I think?"
"That's right, sorry."
"My name is Bond."
"I will do my best."
"You have the right."
"It's still warm."
"How much did it cost?"
"It's a door."
"Give me a chance."
"I can drop you off."
"Are you leaving us already?"
"We searched everywhere."
"Do you find anything?"
"And what does he do?"
"There's something."
"Thank you for your honesty."
"Have I been clear?"
"It will happen."
"You asked for it."
"Someone is here."
"He's my lawyer."
"I'll hold on."
"She is carrying my child."
"There is a crowd."
"You don't know them."
"I'm fine, Mom."
"You can keep them."
"Your fly is open."
"We are very close."
"We're going to stay here."
"Come play with me."
"No, I tell you."
"Congratulations on your promotion."
"You made it."
"What is the topic?"
"It's a market."
"He was executed."
"Come on, spill the beans."
"There's no one here."
"Yeah, that's great."
"What I am."
"He's a pirate."
"Yes, you know that."
"So what's the point?"
"How old was she?"
"I am in heaven."
"How did it happen?"
"Nothing is certain."
"Can we go home now?"
"Not a single word."
"Do you want something?"
"Do you want something?"
"A package for you."
"Are you going to stay there?"
"It's a ritual."
"Who has the keys?"
"Give me an hour."
"I have five."
"He knows his stuff."
"It's ours."
"You are the first."
"This is the exit."
"Are we waiting for someone?"
"Let me explain."
"To change our future."
"He's my hero."
"It makes us happy."
"This is your place."
"They retreat."
"I wasn't looking."
"Thank you for your kindness."
"Where are you now?"
"I have even better."
"It's really exciting."
"Where can we find it?"
"Where can they be?"
"Do you have an address?"
"When will I see you again?"
"That could be it."
"How would you know?"
"Nothing works."
"You're the boss."
"Time is precious."
"I love my son."
"Not just any one."
"A storm is brewing."
"Who told him?"
"No, not that one."
"Have some fun."
"He is our father."
"She's for me."
"You are absolutely right."
"You know the answer."
"Sounds good to me."
"I know that face."
"But that's how it is."
"It's the other one."
"I'll keep in touch."
"I would say no."
"When you are ready."
"Have you met her?"
"Do you want some?"
"She deserved it."
"It's dark in here."
"He assaulted me."
"Yes, you can."
"Four, three, two, one."
"Where were you hiding?"
"I don't want it anymore."
"What time is it?"
"I would have liked to."
"There is still time."
"For many reasons."
"I was looking for something."
"Oh, you know what?"
"We're coming with you."
"Do you work for him?"
"Do you work for him?"
"Sorry, I have to answer."
"I like your hair."
"I love your hair."
"You don't feel it?"
"He collapsed."
"Go ahead, big guy."
"Have you seen them?"
"That's good, there."
"I looked for you."
"I'll do it tomorrow."
"Why do you think that?"
"It's okay, come on."
"I have control."
"What are you working on?"
"I paid attention."
"Do we have a choice?"
"That's the job."
"You've got balls."
"All sorts of things."
"So who was it?"
"I have a card."
"It's winter."
"Where is the king?"
"It's a coincidence."
"Who were you with?"
"Two or three days."
"Who talks like that?"
"You were fantastic."
"It's your party."
"It's the same everywhere."
"I will look into it."
"I never drink."
"Go ahead, my dear."
"She is very strong."
"You are a vampire."
"Keep your cool."
"Get them out of here."
"What does it depend on?"
"Thank you for hosting me."
"This area is prohibited."
"People like that."
"She is a lady."
"Do you have a wife?"
"She got it."
"Didn't you hear anything?"
"I'll wait for you."
"Are we doing this here?"
"They are for you."
"He is very pretty."
"I will call you tomorrow."
"Where is the judge?"
"You know that, don't you?"
"No, it's us."
"Do you have a pencil?"
"No, it's her."
"I apologize, sir."
"Moving forward."
"Go ahead."
"I looked at him."
"What is the mission?"
"I make coffee."
"Yes, it is important."
"How is my boy?"
"I demand an explanation."
"Do you have his address?"
"I want to protect you."
"Your time is up."
"What do you want from him?"
"You are an adult."
"And what is it?"
"You will understand later."
"Do you want eggs?"
"Let me make it up to you."
"A billion dollars."
"He is in surgery."
"It's their right."
"What are you doing to me?"
"What have you become?"
"Where did you learn?"
"That's probably true."
"I'll be brief."
"It's a mutiny."
"They fought."
"Are you on your period?"
"I have a pen."
"Why do you think that?"
"Do you know this guy?"
"I take a picture."
"The dining room."
"Did you find it?"
"It could be better."
"Here he comes."
"Do you know my name?"
"So who are you?"
"You forgot that."
"What's the point of arguing?"
"Will you give it to me?"
"Get in the back."
"What have you decided?"
"A glass of milk."
"Get out of here."
"Oh, that's cool."
"I'm on parole."
"You're welcome."
"Do you have anything to eat?"
"I'll handle this."
"He betrayed me."
"You always do."
"You can always try."
"Go ahead, take it."
"Hope keeps us alive."
"I believe you."
"Very good, and you?"
"Where are you taking him?"
"We have a guest."
"No, that's fine with me."
"God bless him."
"Don't you want to?"
"Now you know."
"He's a beast."
"Have you been married?"
"Give me that phone."
"It can be long."
"Are you being smart?"
"You are a god."
"Where did he go?"
"You got this for me?"
"It's quite impressive."
"She is very cute."
"And I like it."
"No, I don't know."
"I love my children."
"Are you going out with her?"
"I'll get used to it."
"I feel his presence."
"I'm working on it."
"I already have some."
"Why are you interested?"
"Where is the ring?"
"Don't rush."
"This is advice."
"I am a police officer."
"That's very thoughtful."
"How are your parents?"
"What does he want from me?"
"You were talking about me?"
"I like it."
"You have to believe us."
"That's pretty."
"Come in with the milk."
"That's right, Mom."
"Tell me his name."
"Anything new?"
"Not a pretty sight."
"How can I trust you?"
"Do you play golf?"
"I already do it."
"Do you find anything?"
"I have some information."
"We'll talk about it again tomorrow."
"I'll take some."
"It's my passion."
"Nice to be here."
"Give me the tape."
"Give me the money."
"I am so happy."
"In New Jersey."
"We will keep you informed."
"I ate it."
"And I mean it."
"Here's another one."
"I am a robot."
"Give me something to eat."
"It's been so long."
"God is with us."
"Hot water."
"Do you remember that?"
"Hey, you know what?"
"How does he know?"
"We are scientists."
"I got pregnant."
"But no, it's fine."
"I'm always hungry."
"You have to come."
"Still no news?"
"It was a pleasure."
"It's a school."
"I have savings."
"Like all of us, right?"
"I must warn you."
"We are aware."
"I work for you."
"Which is true."
"This is my investigation."
"And I succeeded."
"Do you have permission?"
"I can protect you."
"I like it very much."
"She looks like an angel."
"I was six years old."
"Who am I talking to?"
"What are his chances?"
"I've seen some."
"I'll open the door for you."
"Are you feeling well?"
"Take care of yourself."
"Thanks for the wine."
"I could talk to him."
"Yes, who are you?"
"This meeting is over."
"What is his position?"
"Did you catch it?"
"We'll get to that."
"You stay there."
"That's definitely it."
"If needed."
"What kind of dream?"
"Dad, are you there?"
"Will that be all, sir?"
"I love you very much."
"How did you come?"
"They're coming for you."
"Are you still standing?"
"We'll talk about it later."
"It's very real."
"But you are."
"It can do it."
"You tricked me."
"It doesn't work anymore."
"He is very powerful."
"Did he speak?"
"I love this idea."
"Who invited you?"
"You are very elegant."
"You are very elegant."
"What were you going to do?"
"How did you get in?"
"How did you get in?"
"This is my boat."
"I don't eat."
"I got you."
"And when will that be?"
"You have work to do."
"He has a girlfriend."
"Where do they come from?"
"Nobody knows why."
"This is the proof."
"Did you have an appointment?"
"I can hear you."
"Where are you?"
"Have you met?"
"Because I do."
"It's really wonderful."
"And I'm fine."
"You will never understand."
"I'm looking for work."
"I feel it too."
"My mother is gone."
"Are you sure?"
"I pushed him."
"Do you want an autograph?"
"Let's say that."
"They are after me."
"Yes, I will be there."
"What do you need?"
"High-end."
"But it is."
"I felt good."
"What is your first name?"
"It's all fresh."
"It's still true."
"We'll do it together."
"Nothing stops him."
"Go wherever you want."
"Give me the address."
"I'll take you there."
"What do you think you're going to do?"
"What do you think you're doing?"
"How do you find me?"
"I left her."
"We have witnesses."
"I had a plan."
"Where is the switch?"
"How original."
"I know this story."
"I will go myself."
"Where is the camera?"
"I want a cigarette."
"Did you question him?"
"Absolutely safe."
"These are mine."
"You are welcome."
"He needed it."
"That was my plan."
"What are you here to do?"
"Who are these women?"
"He stayed there."
"She's used to it."
"Smoker or non-smoker?"
"Talk to him about what?"
"I want to find her again."
"Only a few minutes left."
"He is too powerful."
"Now I know why."
"Do you have an appointment?"
"They are killers."
"Where is your phone?"
"We want to talk to you."
"I know it."
"How do you plan to do it?"
"The choice is yours."
"I don't know."
"I want two."
"How is your mom?"
"I'm looking for a girl."
"Where have you been?"
"Where have you been?"
"This is our room."
"Don't you notice anything?"
"I love parties."
"What are you saying?"
"Dad, where are you?"
"There is everything."
"I know his name."
"Come on, I'll walk you home."
"I'll cover you."
"You're a champion."
"Thank you for the evening."
"I will protect you."
"Honey, I love you."
"I had had enough."
"Do you play sports?"
"Are we going for a walk?"
"Whose is it?"
"He was there."
"It's wiser."
"Would you come with me?"
"Put it on the back burner."
"I have a house."
"This is the code."
"I'll shut up."
"We will work together."
"And where is he?"
"I got it back."
"Go for it."
"He has one."
"You can't even imagine."
"I believed you."
"It must be him."
"I am at peace."
"People like you."
"You were almost there."
"I heard you."
"Did you touch her?"
"It's a doll."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"I'm really hungry."
"No, it was you."
"You asked me?"
"He is in good shape."
"If we want, yes."
"I have the number."
"Don't show yourself."
"Stay around."
"You don't want anything?"
"Does this happen to you often?"
"No, that will be all."
"I have news."
"OK, here we are."
"You are so kind."
"I abandoned him."
"Where are the keys?"
"Take me with you."
"You've changed a lot."
"We should talk to him."
"Just a little."
"It suits me fine."
"Do you want my jacket?"
"All at once."
"But where were you?"
"I didn't know him."
"Something is eluding us."
"And you believe her?"
"This could be interesting."
"The room is full."
"It would take a miracle."
"It's been six months."
"A little company?"
"How are you, darling?"
"Who says otherwise?"
"My work is done."
"Not yet, but soon."
"What do you think?"
"Do you want to buy it?"
"Go ahead, show me."
"Keep your head in line."
"We did well."
"We thought about it."
"It's a drug."
"We will treat you."
"More than a year."
"Did she call you?"
"You should go see."
"It didn't work."
"But I want it."
"What is your goal?"
"They look like real ones."
"It's cheaper."
"Can I take them?"
"Back to base."
"Free as a bird."
"Have you ever tried it?"
"I'm going back there."
"Don't you want to come?"
"I have a contract."
"I think I know."
"Do you see the difference?"
"And it was true."
"This is my mom."
"Who is my father?"
"A sign of what?"
"Come on, I'll take you back."
"It's non-negotiable."
"Only one minute left."
"Where did you go?"
"I work for them."
"Who is this from?"
"We all know that."
"How do we get there?"
"What did you take?"
"What did you take?"
"What did you take?"
"I was invited."
"Are you going on vacation?"
"I am an artist."
"Who has time?"
"I don't know how to dance."
"I will think of you."
"That's my line."
"Where is my cell phone?"
"Did you talk to me?"
"Are you really here?"
"Do you know the news?"
"Look on the bright side."
"He is indeed there."
"Absolutely sure."
"Not a soul alive."
"You matter to me."
"Glad to hear it."
"Did you find her?"
"Well done."
"Will you come see me?"
"She doesn't react."
"I'll drive you."
"It might be useful."
"I want to see you again."
"She is a teenager."
"It's a boat."
"What can I add?"
"It will come back to me."
"I will read it."
"I admire your work."
"Where are you hiding?"
"You look better."
"You were quick."
"I love this smell."
"It's been a month."
"I'm so excited."
"He got you."
"Are you new here?"
"Return to your desk."
"Not at all, no."
"I was eight years old."
"What do you really want?"
"We were called."
"Get online."
"You should listen to him."
"You should listen to him."
"That's a good one."
"I have to ask you."
"I have to ask you."
"I'll join you there."
"I counted them."
"Yes, it's you."
"These are my men."
"It was very informative."
"She is much better."
"These are my daughters."
"You can count on it."
"What is he doing now?"
"May God keep you."
"He's still here."
"How do you talk to me?"
"It's their nature."
"A pack of cigarettes."
"Do you have a lawyer?"
"So come with me."
"His place is here."
"Wait until you see this."
"We're fine here."
"Whose is it?"
"Make me an offer."
"I'll be there tomorrow."
"Where does this leave us?"
"They are my friends."
"Go ahead, buddy."
"No, I don't like it."
"The customer is king."
"And I know it."
"You won't kiss me?"
"Don't let anyone in."
"It's the hormones."
"It's funnier."
"It was my home."
"You know the drill."
"I have a list."
"I recommend it to you."
"He is mine."
"I'm all ears."
"You played well."
"Anything in particular?"
"There, it's good."
"What are your intentions?"
"It will all be over soon."
"What do we drink to?"
"Yes, he was there."
"The hospital called."
"Did you follow me?"
"Please let me know."
"It could be."
"What do you want from us?"
"Did you cut yourself?"
"I hear footsteps."
"The police are looking for you."
"Do you like it?"
"I find him cute."
"I should call him."
"What do you want to prove?"
"You have no idea."
"No questions asked."
"Who is in charge?"
"Show me your hand."
"He is very nice."
"What can you do?"
"You're like me."
"Do you have any photos?"
"It's like new."
"Yes, I can."
"She was my sister."
"Is that you?"
"What are they playing at?"
"Would that make you happy?"
"You are my friend."
"He's really cute."
"I guess so."
"Goodbye, Grandma."
"How can you know?"
"Until today."
"It should have worked."
"You can keep them."
"I am a victim."
"You're going to enjoy yourself."
"I know my job."
"Hundreds of times."
"What did they take?"
"What kind of stuff?"
"Well, that's it."
"Nobody is there."
"I owe him."
"How is your shoulder?"
"It's a plus."
"That's new."
"I'm going to the cinema."
"He's not far away."
"Not that much."
"I chose it."
"You have to talk to him."
"We had a deal."
"They agree."
"He's awesome, right?"
"That's all, gentlemen."
"Can we finish this?"
"Yes, I feel it."
"What is your question?"
"We have two."
"I know them well."
"He was so handsome."
"Especially right now."
"I was with her."
"It's a closet."
"I took everything."
"It's very precise."
"Isn't she cute?"
"You woke me up."
"She's cute, isn't she?"
"Do you have a lead?"
"Your time has come."
"And I respect that."
"I am very happy."
"This is our guy."
"Are you with me?"
"There is me."
"What is your opinion?"
"But for what reason?"
"But I will have it."
"They are ahead."
"How can I trust you?"
"I received this."
"It will calm down."
"It's a pigsty."
"That's twice."
"I don't like anyone."
"Did you recognize him?"
"I am grateful to you."
"Kiss her for me."
"And I believe it."
"I just wanted to check."
"I want proof."
"It's a fantasy."
"Have a nice trip."
"But she's fine."
"Who will do it?"
"But who is it?"
"Do you want a cigarette?"
"I like this name."
"How do you like it?"
"Whatever it is."
"Whatever it is."
"Can I ask why?"
"Finally some good news."
"I like her very much."
"In the good old days."
"It's the fashion."
"He took everything."
"It's a mission."
"What is this word?"
"Where is the detonator?"
"What is the result?"
"This is the first one."
"Where is the merchandise?"
"I know, I understand."
"I'll call him."
"May God keep us."
"I'll join you there."
"Come see something."
"They don't listen."
"Where are his parents?"
"Shall we call the cops?"
"Did you report it?"
"That's the deal."
"How do you explain that?"
"Maybe for you."
"Who is he talking to?"
"I have already paid."
"Come and see."
"Did you write that?"
"It's a big one."
"I will join you there."
"Far from it."
"So how are you?"
"We worked together."
"Hello, how are you?"
"The press is here."
"This is the custom."
"But who are you?"
"It's raining."
"It is very effective."
"I like dogs."
"Circumstances have changed."
"They are all there."
"Go to school."
"Welcome to my life."
"He can do anything."
"Yes, it's us."
"Do you want to see it?"
"You're a hero."
"I'm coming for you."
"Do you have a name?"
"Did you listen to me?"
"I will do better."
"I'm trying to work."
"Come whenever you want."
"Is that your opinion?"
"Do you want to come with me?"
"Can you believe it?"
"You must follow me."
"Return to your seats."
"This is my cat."
"It's more convenient."
"What exactly do you want?"
"This is the original."
"You will have your share."
"What did I forget?"
"It's a vegetable."
"It's shorter."
"And that was it."
"Good job, guys."
"The water is hot."
"You must hurry."
"I am very touched."
"She is an actress."
"And the others too."
"I'm going to hide."
"You'll never guess."
"You have good taste."
"I like you too."
"It's very comfortable."
"Yes, it's wonderful."
"How is my daughter?"
"I appreciate your frankness."
"As far as possible."
"It must remain secret."
"That's his style."
"Do you have the number?"
"This is my body."
"Are you having anything?"
"Does it make a difference?"
"She was my daughter."
"It's a word."
"This is the one."
"How is my hair?"
"I'm so happy."
"Didn't you say anything?"
"This guy is amazing."
"I'll come and get you."
"Give me a moment."
"Do you want some wine?"
"How are you here?"
"A real one."
"That's a no."
"Did you get married?"
"I have the same one."
"The film is over."
"I have to end this."
"Are these your children?"
"It's high time."
"We are on duty."
"You don't feel anything?"
"I have mine."
"I have to thank you."
"I'll explain everything to you."
"You don't exist."
"It might do."
"We must be strong."
"Have you thought about it?"
"Oh, you're here."
"Oh, you're here."
"Very good, and you?"
"What are you doing to him?"
"It's a family."
"I'm going upstairs."
"I know the way out."
"Oh, he's fine."
"We can be friends."
"I just want to understand."
"Sorry for the wait."
"I was a child."
"Can you fix this?"
"Can you fix this?"
"That's enough, you two."
"What is the alternative?"
"Oh, that's pretty."
"You can do it yourself."
"Where's the point?"
"I'll fix it."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"Now listen to me carefully."
"Try to stay calm."
"It's really great."
"We should do that."
"I was very young."
"Who remembers?"
"It's nice here."
"You have been chosen."
"You have been chosen."
"You don't feel anything?"
"Oh, I love you."
"Don't hide."
"Go home."
"They were all there."
"I was adopted."
"Not yet, at least."
"I can't wait."
"Where are your clothes?"
"I have forgiven you."
"I'll return it to you."
"I'll give it back to you."
"Tell us about yourself."
"Get out of here."
"Can we concentrate?"
"Don't talk to him."
"Where are you from?"
"Someone like you."
"What you are."
"I could feel it."
"It was the hospital."
"Better to be careful."
"Can you fix it?"
"She's on the phone."
"Thank you for asking."
"Now more than ever."
"I won't pay."
"I prefer to keep quiet."
"You always say that."
"How do we feel?"
"What do you know about it?"
"How much are we talking about?"
"It makes more sense."
"Forward, a third."
"Unlike others."
"And you believe it?"
"I had a blast."
"That's my first name."
"What does all this mean?"
"Can we meet again?"
"And rightly so."
"Everything has been said."
"Are you almost finished?"
"I read them."
"What's your number?"
"It's the season."
"The decision is yours."
"I volunteer."
"These are proofs."
"Do you want some bread?"
"When is it coming?"
"I have that too."
"Is he your friend?"
"No, she went out."
"What did I win?"
"It must be you."
"Where is the radio?"
"You will find a way."
"You will find a way."
"You will do nothing."
"I know your secret."
"This is the dream."
"You were perfect."
"I admire you very much."
"And where to go?"
"His car is there."
"A quarter of an hour."
"With luck."
"Here we go."
"Oh, I know."
"It's your nature."
"Did you bring it?"
"Who wants a beer?"
"I must not."
"I'm doing something."
"I came to get the news."
"He is in front of you."
"It's very nice."
"How is your son?"
"I'll let you discuss."
"You can stay here."
"I don't sell."
"I command you."
"This makes perfect sense."
"Sorry, I have to go."
"Sorry, I forgot."
"Do you know my father?"
"Can you hold this?"
"He will calm down."
"I was born here."
"What were you thinking?"
"This is my girl."
"Sounds pretty good."
"I know, darling."
"It's the postman."
"What did I miss?"
"To some extent."
"It's quite rare."
"Do you want some cake?"
"Do you want some cake?"
"You helped me."
"The door was closed."
"The taxi is here."
"I slept well."
"I'm going with her."
"It's a snake."
"Go inside the house."
"You can't do anything."
"Do you have kids?"
"The weather is so beautiful."
"And we will."
"Give me your wallet."
"Are you capable of it?"
"He's someone."
"How curious."
"Are you going to rat me out?"
"I'll let you know."
"I married her."
"Not for years."
"I like it here."
"This is your man."
"Hey, wait a minute."
"Accidents happen."
"I will guide you."
"They are criminals."
"Let's go to my room."
"Look at me, look at me."
"One at a time."
"A bit like you."
"A bit like you."
"Is this your brother?"
"Hello, how are you?"
"How much do you need?"
"After all this time."
"Let's start again at the beginning."
"I like this girl."
"I want something else."
"I'll take you."
"We need to talk to you."
"We need to talk to you."
"Don't ask me anything."
"I take the bus."
"This is how it is."
"Can you lend it to me?"
"What exactly are you looking for?"
"I'm going to the lab."
"Where do we start?"
"He's my agent."
"Why are you going there?"
"Yes, they are."
"Are you talking about that?"
"I love women."
"Give me the keys."
"Do you know this girl?"
"It's still possible."
"I'm doing my homework."
"It must be perfect."
"Watch your feet."
"He was."
"You are the first."
"You took an oath."
"What do you want from him?"
"Me, anyway."
"He already knows it."
"It's just me."
"It's just me."
"I deleted it."
"It's quite common."
"Stay near the phone."
"It's better now."
"I made arrangements."
"You are very sexy."
"Do you want to sit down?"
"You're going to have a blast."
"It's a camera."
"You are next."
"And one last thing."
"So listen to me carefully."
"I made it."
"God be with you."
"I am finally free."
"Who was that?"
"It is a symbol."
"Where is she now?"
"It could be long."
"Are you coming tonight?"
"It seems logical to me."
"Where is the treasure?"
"It's pretty simple."
"You should be proud."
"Be nice to him."
"Do you want a soda?"
"Take me home."
"We have time."
"Are you the manager?"
"End of the meeting."
"Have you spoken to him?"
"I'm still thinking about it."
"Are you with him?"
"Move on."
"I'm going to marry you."
"How do you know her?"
"How do you know her?"
"I promise you."
"Nobody does."
"I miss him already."
"She is at my house."
"I want to look at you."
"It's very old."
"Enjoy your stay."
"She's a teenager."
"Go get the others."
"Come play with us."
"Go back to your work."
"I'm looking for a man."
"Not as much as me."
"You're going to stay here."
"Let's go back inside."
"I make conversation."
"This is my bag."
"It's been a while."
"It depends on him."
"This is a signal."
"We are professionals."
"We are professionals."
"Yeah, I see it."
"Where is the target?"
"Do you like children?"
"She will never come back."
"You get up early."
"Where is yours?"
"Thank you for calling."
"This is this house."
"That reminds me."
"It's a room."
"I'll tell you everything."
"I thought you were different."
"It will be war."
"I follow orders."
"It was mine."
"Do you want to know everything?"
"Yeah, I remember."
"Why do you believe that?"
"How are you, honey?"
"You will find a solution."
"I'll get it back."
"I love doing this."
"You can do better."
"She has a boyfriend."
"You understand that, right?"
"We already knew that."
"If all goes well."
"And that surprises you?"
"I have both."
"It's very big."
"But he is there."
"Thank you for the invitation."
"Have you been married?"
"It's been two hours."
"Come here for a second."
"I had thought about it."
"Stay in your place."
"You don't know what?"
"You were wonderful."
"Hey, are you listening to me?"
"It's quite rare."
"We agreed."
"But I survived."
"Where is the father?"
"Hold it like this."
"You have to tell them."
"Are you coming or what?"
"He was looking for something."
"That's talking."
"The bathroom."
"This is my leg."
"Let's get her out of here."
"I saw them."
"It was so beautiful."
"And what is it?"
"He loves you very much."
"This is perfectly normal."
"All you had to do was ask."
"An ID?"
"Let me examine you."
"Is that your answer?"
"Did you take everything?"
"Did you take everything?"
"We are at home."
"But it's getting better."
"You are the boss."
"I'll look behind."
"He found me."
"We got it."
"So, is this you?"
"I'll get her back."
"I went everywhere."
"What kind of plan?"
"Are you wearing a microphone?"
"I am a teacher."
"It's chance."
"She was kidnapped."
"You are a man."
"What are you hiding from me?"
"I was at the cinema."
"What were we talking about?"
"What does it consist of?"
"Something strong."
"Who is the buyer?"
"He was kidnapped."
"It's his baby."
"You must not."
"And here we go."
"The cleaning lady."
"I love this piece."
"Don't rush me."
"That's you."
"Almost every day."
"Goodbye everyone."
"They trust me."
"The bullet went through."
"I love this music."
"Oh, I forgot."
"You always will be."
"It's a phone."
"Come on, that's it."
"Are you happy now?"
"Are you happy now?"
"And she knows it."
"Your driver's license."
"This way out."
"Where is your helmet?"
"You are absolutely right."
"Are you waiting for someone?"
"Yes, it's different."
"I was early."
"Did you kiss?"
"No need to walk me home."
"This is really serious."
"With everyone."
"Sit with us."
"I'm doing well."
"Who is your master?"
"No, I am."
"I assure you."
"Let's take a look."
"Are you expecting a call?"
"I still don't understand."
"Where is the evidence?"
"Who is this lady?"
"He is still unconscious."
"You are very kind."
"I'm preparing dinner."
"It's a job."
"It's a name."
"I planned everything."
"They want war?"
"Just a little while."
"She's good, isn't she?"
"She's good, isn't she?"
"I am his doctor."
"They grow up so fast."
"She will recover."
"I was like you."
"He was my boss."
"Oh my God, yes."
"I sincerely think so."
"No, I remember."
"I always will be."
"You can be proud."
"I wanted to see him."
"What is she playing at?"
"You are a soldier."
"I'll take this one."
"The sun is up."
"It's your role."
"It was definitely him."
"I will keep my promise."
"It's nobody."
"That's true too."
"No one will hear you."
"She wants to see me."
"I was waiting for that."
"Do you want to be part of it?"
"The answer is there."
"I am the queen."
"Just to be sure."
"They are very pretty."
"The lines are cut."
"We are very happy."
"Return to your seat."
"She works for me."
"We'll talk tomorrow."
"I'll manage on my own."
"And do you know why?"
"She looks like your mother."
"The good of all."
"How much does it cost?"
"No, that's it."
"Where is the mother?"
"Not during service."
"I'm going to wear it."
"Do you have a radio?"
"Just the two of us."
"Let's stay a little longer."
"It's not them."
"You'll do."
"Did he call you?"
"You understand me."
"When did they leave?"
"Are you sure?"
"Anything useful?"
"But I should have."
"Here, here and here."
"Let me take this."
"It's been three months."
"I know how to do everything."
"Do you think that's fair?"
"I was five years old."
"This is racketeering."
"Take my word for it."
"Lipstick."
"Give me a drink."
"Give me a glass."
"We all do it."
"They are in there."
"I guessed it."
"He just came back."
"No, it's personal."
"What are the options?"
"Since you say so."
"You could have called."
"It was last night."
"This is that place."
"This is his place."
"He is so handsome."
"How are you, Mom?"
"I know the place."
"Get in the car."
"Do you have a key?"
"About that."
"Yeah, yeah, I know."
"How are you, friend?"
"Good night, my son."
"I'm better off here."
"I take pictures."
"She's going to wake up."
"But things are changing."
"This is the first."
"This one is good."
"Do you want to go to lunch?"
"Did you page me?"
"Can we talk about it again?"
"She's your friend."
"And she loves me."
"I understood correctly."
"The time has passed."
"And I love you."
"You don't want anything?"
"I'll go then."
"You were brave."
"There were some."
"I'll take you there."
"It is very noble."
"I'm not waiting."
"But he changed."
"Can you explain to me?"
"Stay home."
"We are a family."
"Let's keep this to ourselves."
"I have to talk to them."
"Thank you for the book."
"Yes, we know that."
"Keep that in mind."
"What is your price?"
"What is this place?"
"How could you?"
"Me too, by the way."
"Do you have an explanation?"
"The end of what?"
"Is this your place?"
"I'm going to leave now."
"Are you in there?"
"You will know soon."
"Did you feel that?"
"Don't listen to me."
"He's a tough guy."
"What time is it?"
"How is the leg?"
"What is it?"
"Get rid of it."
"Are we still friends?"
"What could I say?"
"You have two days."
"Can I hold it?"
"Can you believe it?"
"Do you hear anything?"
"What do you think you will do?"
"He plays with us."
"I love you."
"Let him call me."
"That's right, yes."
"I have a date."
"It's almost the same."
"Let's move on."
"I'm going to make it up to you."
"Between the two eyes."
"Everything is working as expected."
"I have patients."
"Not since this morning."
"The power is out."
"Can I touch her?"
"I was held back."
"How do we proceed?"
"How could I have?"
"It's okay, come on."
"Count to ten."
"You fucked me."
"Where is the woman?"
"Who's next?"
"Did you open it?"
"See you next year."
"It's pretty incredible."
"I am a lady."
"Go get the car."
"I'll be there soon."
"But I know it."
"What should I say?"
"I'll warn them."
"I have time."
"It's freedom."
"It must be."
"Let's go to the hotel."
"Good job, guys."
"Yes, it's cool."
"You love him, right?"
"Thank you for this meal."
"A masterpiece."
"I am a writer."
"It's still dark."
"Like all men."
"Go all the way."
"Do you want an autograph?"
"You knew that, right?"
"The connection is ready."
"It's a song."
"You know the rule."
"I have a friend."
"Take me there."
"You can talk to him."
"I can hear it."
"I love this series."
"There are a lot of them."
"What are we playing?"
"We must stay together."
"I want explanations."
"The wind has turned."
"What did you buy?"
"What were you doing here?"
"How did he get in?"
"How will I know?"
"This cannot be."
"I've been busy."
"I'm having a lot of fun."
"It can wait until tomorrow."
"I love this story."
"They are ours."
"She's great, isn't she?"
"You have to accept it."
"Take this with you."
"You are very insightful."
"That seems correct to me."
"But it's interesting."
"They are our friends."
"I'm not thirsty."
"Where is your friend?"
"Can I open them?"
"What is your job?"
"They've already left."
"Do you play soccer?"
"I understood you."
"The question is simple."
"It will be simpler."
"I loved it."
"You want an apology?"
"Roughly, yes."
"Wait for me a moment."
"I will prove it."
"Yes, I admit it."
"What are these things?"
"This is our signal."
"Sounds familiar."
"I want to know you."
"My life depends on it."
"Give me details."
"I was at work."
"I like both."
"Ask him the question."
"I loved him too."
"I should be there."
"Give me your address."
"What are you doing here?"
"I will see to it personally."
"We have the results."
"Do you see all this?"
"You are very brave."
"Maybe a week."
"A car is waiting for us."
"Don't you like her?"
"He will tell you."
"It can be fun."
"I prefer it this way."
"You ask me?"
"Did you follow me?"
"That I love you."
"Sorry to wake you up."
"It's himself."
"Where is the ball?"
"You are right, sir."
"Your attention to all."
"She stays with me."
"They will do it."
"And what is it like?"
"Where are the diamonds?"
"Glad to see you."
"I'm going out for a while."
"I'm past that."
"Yes, I follow you."
"Don't wake them up."
"How many are there?"
"Come sit here."
"We'll look into that."
"This is my country."
"It was hard."
"Do you have coffee?"
"Don't be embarrassed."
"Don't be embarrassed."
"Yeah, if you want."
"My wife is sick."
"He touched me."
"Good night, sweetie."
"You should have called."
"I am your family."
"I will introduce him to you."
"That's your opinion."
"Nice to meet you."
"I'll make the introductions."
"Very far from here."
"You know what, Dad?"
"We'll check that out."
"It's your responsibility."
"I'm online."
"Something good."
"I am your son."
"You should see it."
"What do you say, again?"
"I felt it."
"The mission is complete."
"I was so young."
"You kissed me."
"What did you write?"
"I had fun."
"Thank you for your visit."
"Are you doing your homework?"
"Sorry about last night."
"He was someone."
"If I say no?"
"And where are you going?"
"The cavalry has arrived."
"Where are your shoes?"
"Oh, thank you."
"I caught it."
"What time?"
"Who wants dessert?"
"Are you still together?"
"It will be over soon."
"They are men."
"Say hello to him."
"Do you want answers?"
"It costs nothing."
"It should be."
"He is too smart."
"It's a male."
"I spent it."
"Did I wake you up?"
"Can I speak frankly?"
"He's from the FBI."
"What does the doctor say?"
"These are the last ones."
"Do you hear that noise?"
"I worked there."
"We are very close."
"I have to say it."
"Did you go out together?"
"It was this morning."
"It's a monkey."
"Who hired you?"
"Don't come home late."
"But it's done."
"Sorry, I forgot."
"That should be me."
"Who do you work for?"
"What is your answer?"
"No matter the reason."
"Madam, are you well?"
"Wait until you see this."
"I opened it."
"I want to be here."
"I will remember it."
"No, I prefer not to."
"Yeah, it's possible."
"We are all the same."
"I love this scene."
"How do you plan to do it?"
"I have a revolver."
"Where is his family?"
"It was on the news."
"That's just it."
"Do you have anything else?"
"It's just that.."
"Yes, it's pretty."
"What do you want to drink?"
"Easy money."
"Take care."
"Sounds perfect to me."
"And you, how was your day?"
"When did you get back?"
"Yeah, I noticed."
"How does he do that?"
"And what does he do?"
"When do we start?"
"One of a kind."
"Was that your father?"
"I care about her."
"Where is the general?"
"This is the door."
"I see the picture."
"Can you identify it?"
"It must be him."
"Did I have a choice?"
"Have you talked about it?"
"He is on a mission."
"I know this guy."
"Let me introduce you."
"Who started this?"
"You have my card."
"Where is your partner?"
"Let me talk to them."
"I'm next."
"Where are the cameras?"
"I brought this."
"See you later, Dad."
"Go to the hospital."
"It's a car."
"The papers are ready."
"They are my family."
"We have to hide."
"Will you listen to me?"
"I am the last."
"Do you play golf?"
"I'll tell them."
"The bar is open."
"I care about you."
"How is the little one?"
"I will stop you."
"What do you suggest?"
"And I do."
"Not at the time."
"Did you hear that?"
"Yes, that's nice."
"So don't say anything."
"She doesn't say anything."
"I will receive it."
"Jesus is our lighthouse."
"I am grateful for that."
"It wasn't her."
"Watch where you walk."
"I have the power."
"He helped me."
"Do you want to go somewhere else?"
"She's on her way."
"Two or three times."
"How do you find that?"
"Where is this guy?"
"Where is the money?"
"And where were you?"
"We will see each other again soon."
"They want to talk to you."
"You heard wrong."
"Did you invent it?"
"He's doing much better."
"Who put this?"
"Give me two."
"What did I miss?"
"Nice to see you again."
"This has gone on long enough."
"And she was right."
"Then he disappeared."
"He has the flu."
"One of your friends?"
"It's cinema."
"You are so smart."
"I wanted to see you again."
"I'll find them."
"Do you recognize anyone?"
"You have a visitor."
"My head is spinning."
"We are far from that."
"He is a patient."
"The class is over."
"How was the flight?"
"How are you doing, man?"
"She's his sister."
"How do they do that?"
"Where did she come from?"
"Are you a cop?"
"Do you have any matches?"
"I'll take him down."
"Is he a relative?"
"You were supposed to call me."
"I'm going to wake him up."
"Nothing of the sort."
"We'll think about it."
"It's all up to you."
"I will be delighted."
"Who is she?"
"Am I forgetting something?"
"We begin the massage."
"How do you find it?"
"I am one."
"You must be thirsty."
"I await your orders."
"He has the girl."
"Thank you for coming back."
"How did you get home?"
"Who did you call?"
"He wants to talk to us."
"Where is this place?"
"Like many people."
"It's politics."
"Look, he's here."
"Give me time."
"How are you, madam?"
"It's almost ready."
"I always keep my word."
"Do you really want it?"
"She took it."
"They are very good."
"We had a deal."
"As you see."
"Where do they come from?"
"Things to sort out."
"We're going to the movies."
"Is she with you?"
"Stay in your seats."
"Where are they taking us?"
"It's a cemetery."
"You are at my house."
"It's your day."
"Don't look at it."
"We're talking about you."
"Thank you for taking me."
"What's up, Doc?"
"This is very clever."
"You should calm down."
"Who are you talking to?"
"It's very sexy."
"You do your job."
"She's doing well."
"Give him time."
"Give it time."
"Never heard that name."
"But I'm working on it."
"Ready to go?"
"This is that man."
"You had a choice."
"Who paid you?"
"We go around."
"I cleaned everything."
"No, I have nothing."
"Shall we eat?"
"This is the basis."
"We're going on a trip."
"What is your status?"
"You have to leave."
"You proved it."
"We have a witness."
"You have a job."
"It was an experience."
"He's the mayor."
"It's probably better."
"I turn the page."
"She won't leave."
"And tell them what?"
"Nice to see you again."
"We're finally here."
"A fun part."
"I wanted to congratulate you."
"You know the drill."
"Do you want to call him?"
"I am the victim."
"Is my baby okay?"
"If you're interested."
"Where were you born?"
"Nobody really knows."
"Less and less."
"Do you believe in ghosts?"
"He was murdered."
"It could be nice."
"You were perfect."
"Yes, you will."
"Do you see the picture?"
"I noticed it."
"Send me the invoice."
"Good night, my friend."
"Come have a drink."
"Shall I take your coat?"
"Who is the owner?"
"I want a drink."
"It's so pretty."
"I am a thief."
"Now get out of here."
"But you knew that."
"I think it's great."
"I'll call him tomorrow."
"Why ask me this?"
"You can't enter."
"I don't steal."
"It can always be useful."
"It's a key."
"I take the lead."
"The best of the best."
"Same for me."
"This is the director."
"I answered you."
"My son is sick."
"I like sex."
"How do they know?"
"Visits are prohibited."
"What can you do?"
"It's fine for me."
"I'll pick it up."
"I have a husband."
"But I came back."
"Where is the TV?"
"When will he come back?"
"I have plans."
"But he disappeared."
"What is the title?"
"That's my type."
"It changed everything."
"She has a gift."
"She's not ready."
"Come on, everything's fine."
"Whoever you are."
"Where is your brother?"
"Everything worked out."
"Where is the kitchen?"
"I have a reputation."
"Did you keep it?"
"What is the name?"
"You needed it."
"Thanks for the champagne."
"I am an imposter."
"What do you do next?"
"To change his destiny."
"This is my back."
"I have to tell you."
"In every way."
"I have to have it."
"Nobody home."
"It's the sun."
"Do you want cereal?"
"I'm so excited."
"So where is he?"
"Nothing will happen to you."
"It's good, really."
"Since day one."
"This is our child."
"I mean now."
"He wants to talk to me."
"We'll bring her back."
"Do you think you can do it?"
"This is good news."
"I like this one."
"Don't say no."
"He is a writer."
"We should discuss this."
"We will find a way."
"A love story."
"You're missing out."
"I give them to you."
"I was there too."
"It takes time."
"Can you see me?"
"Things like that."
"Good night, my love."
"Your date of birth?"
"Haven't you heard?"
"Tell us the truth."
"What are you doing tomorrow?"
"What are you doing tomorrow?"
"They did it quickly."
"They came here."
"How is the arm?"
"We all love you."
"Who would have done this?"
"You are the boss."
"Did you find her?"
"Come here for a minute."
"It's dawn."
"This is my aunt."
"Your room is ready."
"Take my word for it."
"She got pregnant."
"Do you want to buy it?"
"You must be happy."
"You have the floor."
"I'll keep it."
"I have a job."
"I already called."
"Try to remember."
"This is my wife."
"As long as possible."
"You are really pretty."
"It's Friday night."
"Don't ask me why."
"You are like that."
"It's so easy."
"That's good."
"Do you want to do it again?"
"How old are you?"
"I agreed."
"Yes, everyone."
"This is the driver."
"Go back home."
"Go home."
"We have a lead."
"Excuse me, do we know each other?"
"Where do we put it?"
"She is no more."
"It's nerves."
"We are complete."
"That's my advice."
"Who do you work for?"
"Do you want some milk?"
"Put the handcuffs on him."
"This is my writing."
"So what are you doing?"
"I love dogs."
"You are very talented."
"You could talk to him."
"I have principles."
"I have a dog."
"Well, let's see."
"Tens of thousands."
"He was right here."
"Oh, it'll be fine."
"Plans have changed."
"That's their job."
"No, I don't understand."
"Not just anyone."
"Where can I find it?"
"Return to base."
"It suits you well."
"Are you going to let me go?"
"That's it, sir."
"You should read it."
"Can't you hear me?"
"Can I come too?"
"This is our destiny."
"Where did you go?"
"Yes, everything will be fine."
"I want to hear that."
"I take the stairs."
"He found her."
"And it will be over."
"Who sent you?"
"It's with pleasure."
"People like me?"
"At the action stations."
"He is so young."
"Do I make myself understood?"
"Ah, I get it."
"Have you heard everything?"
"You weren't sleeping?"
"No, we stay together."
"What was that noise?"
"Do you have any names?"
"I have to warn you."
"One of my friends."
"I admire your courage."
"I have a lawyer."
"I'm almost there."
"I take a taxi."
"Who was with you?"
"Would you like to come with me?"
"I called everywhere."
"I like the idea."
"Wait for me there."
"I know your father."
"Is that you, Dad?"
"Solid as a rock."
"I'm still shaking."
"All systems go."
"He's a player."
"Hello, Officer."
"I am the sheriff."
"But who is he?"
"I'm going to buy some."
"That's part of it."
"How did you survive?"
"Where are my daughters?"
"Welcome to the future."
"You are really cute."
"I was told."
"Why not this one?"
"Great job, guys."
"Let him stay there."
"That was a good call."
"I will serve you."
"He's a model."
"I went back there."
"Here we go, man."
"How many do you have?"
"You're right, darling."
"Please."
"You're welcome."
"I need to know why."
"I'll come with you."
"Let him go a little."
"Give me one."
"We'll take you back."
"It's been three weeks."
"I wanted to tell you."
"Hold on to me."
"Nothing, I'm fine."
"Where is your son?"
"What is your question?"
"I came to see you."
"I'm having hallucinations."
"Do you know this place?"
"Where are they all going?"
"But you think so."
"I will never give up."
"How does it look?"
"You never listen."
"No, not for that."
"Only one week left."
"How cute."
"What is your idea?"
"Do you have any news?"
"I'll let you work."
"OK, here we go."
"I would be honored."
"You like me."
"It's the sheriff."
"And much more."
"Like all women."
"Tell them to leave."
"This day has arrived."
"We will get through this."
"This is the priority."
"It is a transmitter."
"And water."
"Go up to your room."
"Call whenever you want."
"So what do we do?"
"He is still here."
"This is your domain."
"I'll tell you."
"Let's go inside."
"We can stay here."
"What does it say?"
"It's more comfortable."
"She did well."
"Did he call you?"
"I made them."
"Your house is beautiful."
"I should have understood."
"I'm fine too."
"Hence my question."
"I have to hurry."
"I hid."
"There, I have it."
"I recognized you."
"And there was light."
"I knew it."
"This is absolutely true."
"Where is the suitcase?"
"Let's get to work, guys."
"Do you want details?"
"How are you?"
"Do you have a question?"
"And I knew it."
"Give us a moment."
"Do you like this girl?"
"It's only natural."
"I had work."
"I'll take this one."
"He is a priest."
"Tell him to come."
"It's instinct."
"I know I do."
"He was strangled."
"Do you understand your rights?"
"I was nine years old."
"It was my duty."
"In that genre."
"Are you with me?"
"It looks like a real one."
"I will stay in touch."
"Who sent this?"
"To please me."
"You're mine."
"I can hear you."
"He is at work."
"No, go ahead, you."
"May God be with you."
"We can fix this."
"You can keep it."
"Yeah, he's here."
"It's the army."
"How is it again?"
"I don't negotiate."
"Was that your plan?"
"Do you agree?"
"They followed us."
"This is very promising."
"Safety first."
"You should have said it before."
"I don't think anything."
"I'm going back to work."
"I have them everywhere."
"He is an agent."
"We have injuries."
"How does she know?"
"I have the means."
"Yes, I know that."
"It's going to be okay, ma'am."
"He has a family."
"Where are you from?"
"This is progress."
"Get her out of there."
"I take a pen."
"The field is clear."
"No need for you."
"I'm writing a book."
"I like looking at you."
"I love your show."
"I'll call you back tomorrow."
"It's a privilege."
"Are you capable of it?"
"Can I be of help?"
"It's in you."
"You must be proud."
"Want more?"
"Was that why?"
"I'm going back to work."
"They are very strong."
"You must stay here."
"Go to the window."
"Where do I start?"
"A little milk?"
"Sorry for my delay."
"How do you spell it?"
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"Are you sure?"
"She's cute, isn't she?"
"It was on the ground."
"I catch my breath."
"With money."
"Do you want war?"
"I am a survivor."
"How did you come?"
"Received five out of five."
"I love my father."
"When I was little."
"It's for you."
"So, what are you?"
"They are safe."
"Yes, Your Honor."
"It was a lot of fun."
"Why did he come?"
"I want to buy it."
"That was my mission."
"Come whenever you want."
"Very good, thank you very much."
"It's so unfair."
"Where do I put this?"
"Something simple."
"The phone rang."
"This is your story."
"Wherever he is."
"How nice."
"May I introduce myself?"
"Go to the infirmary."
"You are part of it."
"I'll explain to you later."
"I'm doing it now."
"Do you know how to play it?"
"How did you get out?"
"I watch the news."
"You can stay here."
"That's very clever."
"It's a hologram."
"They are my brothers."
"Let's go to your room."
"It's so cute."
"You are so kind."
"You have carte blanche."
"You have two minutes."
"What are they for?"
"It was his birthday."
"It's a precaution."
"That's it, darling."
"You are a sweetheart."
"Tell him to leave."
"Here are some more."
"People can change."
"I can't read."
"We have to leave."
"This is my head."
"Her name is Buffy."
"I won't do it again."
"Come back right away."
"We must act now."
"You were good."
"Yes, that would be great."
"This is my book."
"It's an eternity."
"We can protect you."
"Who is it then?"
"But I thought about it."
"I let it happen."
"Get in the truck."
"He has guts."
"I'll take you back."
"It's been ten years."
"I go through the back."
"You should take it."
"It's a city."
"They already know that."
"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
"This is our role."
"You have a gift."
"We'll do that tomorrow."
"So you know what?"
"Yes, I do."
"Is this wise?"
"I am delighted."
"In my whole life."
"She was so young."
"You should be proud."
"No other solution."
"Let's go then."
"And thank you for everything."
"Where did she go?"
"Where are you taking them?"
"He was behind me."
"Thanks for the explanation."
"Where is the director?"
"When did you come out?"
"Can you teach me?"
"Not like this one."
"Let's keep it simple."
"You should have come."
"What are the charges?"
"I hope for you."
"That's how things go."
"I like surprises."
"Go to the car."
"We are in Paris."
"Don't tell them."
"This is really me."
"So it's settled."
"She's a thief."
"It will be fine for me."
"It's been five years."
"I cut myself."
"It was necessary."
"You smell so good."
"Did I see right?"
"It's a process."
"I'll take that off."
"For what else?"
"Do I have mail?"
"I sold everything."
"How do you do that?"
"Nobody has it."
"You're completely sick."
"I understand everything now."
"Well, do it."
"Come here for a bit."
"You are making progress."
"I have four."
"You should leave now."
"We know that."
"Did you call them?"
"In those waters."
"That's very brave."
"What is written?"
"It's a legacy."
"Take a look."
"I can live with it."
"It's all hot."
"You are very good."
"I'll be back."
"I am the Slayer."
"He is the best."
"Let's talk about it later."
"What kind of noise?"
"I'll keep an eye on him."
"No one answered."
"It just came out."
"Not cool at all."
"It was his."
"Do you know this woman?"
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"It's perfect here."
"I am a tomb."
"Brothers and sisters?"
"It's his nature."
"Where is the beer?"
"Welcome, everyone."
"How can I be forgiven?"
"I still have it."
"It's a chopper."
"God is my witness."
"What are you doing outside?"
"Come here, my boy."
"You are very cute."
"Thank you for your work."
"My name is Ray."
"He is a colleague."
"This is my dress."
"She's a queen."
"I came home late."
"Yes, I would love to."
"That's already a lot."
"Sorry for asking."
"Do you let him do it?"
"They don't say anything."
"Face it."
"Are you coming to pick me up?"
"What kind is it?"
"He's fine, thank you."
"Do I have any messages?"
"This is the mother."
"My name is Bob."
"It's an exchange."
"Where are your glasses?"
"I withdraw my question."
"Are you serious?"
"It's just temporary."
"Ask her out."
"Who is your father?"
"Keep it to yourself."
"Oh, that's lovely."
"I will stop him."
"Don't go anywhere."
"Yeah, I think so."
"It's a recording."
"That would be really nice."
"A family story."
"So what do we do?"
"I'm going with them."
"Do you recognize this woman?"
"Not in this life."
"You'll love them."
"Are you letting me go?"
"Do you want to meet her?"
"Do you believe it?"
"I'm waiting for a call."
"Don't do it."
"Do you know this guy?"
"Yes, Mr. President."
"Who agrees?"
"Goodbye, my love."
"Goodbye, my love."
"I would like to see you."
"I know my job."
"It's going to be hot."
"Thank you for all this."
"Do you like children?"
"You'll love this."
"How did it come out?"
"A stroke of luck."
"Not at home."
"It seems to me, yes."
"Did he tell you?"
"Come on, let's dance."
"I would be delighted."
"You didn't ask."
"It's better here."
"I watch my weight."
"Can you take me back?"
"He left that."
"No one will believe it."
"I'll question him."
"Give me his name."
"Did you touch it?"
"What are you planning?"
"Who did you see?"
"Call whoever you want."
"That says a lot."
"I owe you a lot."
"You can't leave."
"It's going to be fair."
"I am so relieved."
"I am filing for divorce."
"I will accompany him."
"Do you like cats?"
"He will receive you."
"I take a look."
"How's business?"
"I am your friend."
"This is the uniform."
"And how was it?"
"The power is back on."
"Do your best."
"Until what time?"
"What is your mission?"
"No, thank you."
"You're a friend."
"Would you mind going out?"
"Wasn't I right?"
"Let's go, children."
"You have to see it."
"Can you give me some?"
"I saw it well."
"They are coming."
"You are a child."
"Show me your face."
"Do you still have any?"
"What are you doing standing up?"
"Does that make you happy?"
"You are my friend."
"This will interest you."
"This is my signature."
"She's a professional."
"You have five seconds."
"Nothing is perfect."
"I want an ice cream."
"I want names."
"Nobody talks to me."
"You mean that?"
"Yes, that's understood."
"Who is responsible here?"
"I understand you perfectly."
"Wait, that's it?"
"There's work to be done."
"We have proof."
"What are their names?"
"Don't even try."
"Don't even try."
"Why did she come?"
"You have to tell him."
"What did you eat?"
"It's an exercise."
"How is your friend?"
"Who is he with?"
"Is this understood?"
"We need to question him."
"It wasn't intentional."
"Do you think you can do it?"
"Tell me no."
"Tell them to wait."
"I'll do the rest."
"Oh, that's easy."
"It was."
"We finally meet."
"I'll warn her."
"Come to my office."
"Come into my office."
"What if they come back?"
"The introductions are made."
"This is my face."
"We make a deal."
"When I'm ready."
"You are absolutely right."
"The others, with me."
"I loved my father."
"We are soldiers."
"My name is Earl."
"Okay, that's it."
"He must be stopped."
"You are very attractive."
"Do you have a date?"
"It's so much better."
"What are you doing to me?"
"It was my turn."
"Can I see them?"
"I'll explain it to him."
"Have you thought about it?"
"Have you thought about it?"
"I'm just passing through."
"Ah yes, I see."
"Do you want some too?"
"Okay, I got it."
"The day is over."
"He knows things."
"This is a scoop."
"He likes her."
"They attacked us."
"She was my sister."
"What were the chances?"
"We suspected it."
"I'm going to be a father."
"What kind of service?"
"What is your specialty?"
"You two, go ahead."
"They're going to get us."
"I still have some."
"Like father, like daughter."
"I'll call the police."
"I'm going to untie you."
"Nothing will change."
"You have to understand this."
"Wait, you'll see."
"It was right there."
"For your own good."
"Come over here, you."
"Are you taking his side?"
"Come on, say something."
"What is he talking about?"
"Stay in your place."
"You are very beautiful."
"It makes me happy."
"You are my hero."
"I'll keep it short."
"You are a gentleman."
"Can I read it?"
"How much do you need?"
"Who decided it?"
"I'll take care of it."
"Let's go see over there."
"You are very talented."
"Nor anyone else."
"Give me an example."
"And close the door."
"She helped me."
"Give me a second."
"I really enjoyed it."
"I have a system."
"Business first."
"What did that mean?"
"I have his picture."
"Do you have any left?"
"Have you ever tried it?"
"It's exactly the same."
"It will get better."
"I can bring it back."
"I'm going to the theater."
"This is my part."
"They always say that."
"I'll see him tomorrow."
"Do you have a tissue?"
"Do you have a tissue?"
"Give me a break."
"How is your foot?"
"I use it."
"You should be happy."
"I need some."
"Get out of the car."
"I'm waiting for a friend."
"I am a star."
"Who made it?"
"Can you find it?"
"He's a winner."
"Who is the judge?"
"Who wants it?"
"It makes things easier."
"What was the plan?"
"You have two hours."
"Shall we have a toast?"
"I know, sweetie."
"I created it."
"Have you just moved in?"
"It was very impressive."
"We're all fine."
"Not these days."
"I'm fine."
"I'm going to leave soon."
"We have faith."
"Not every day."
"Not in this city."
"I'm missing it."
"I've had my fill."
"Surprised to see me?"
"Where are the files?"
"The best in the world."
"One more day."
"Would that change anything?"
"Who is your boss?"
"Did they catch him?"
"It was his life."
"Thank you for your interest."
"Let me walk you home."
"My time is precious."
"And to do what?"
"It's really excellent."
"It's a promotion."
"Here and there."
"But we are here."
"I'm looking for this girl."
"Who told you?"
"That's right, darling."
"I was born ready."
"Should I take a message?"
"And for dinner?"
"Yeah, I like that."
"You must forgive me."
"What did you get?"
"Who are you exactly?"
"Anyone."
"She looked at me."
"I have to shower."
"I'll tell you when."
"It will be so."
"No, it's nice."
"You look good."
"What are your plans?"
"You are an imposter."
"That's very kind."
"I didn't take anything."
"They are cops."
"It's karma."
"I'm feeling good."
"I'm fine, thank you."
"She's a colleague."
"Don't come here."
"He's gone again."
"Nice to meet you."
"I am the mayor."
"Is there anything?"
"Where have you been?"
"Where have you been?"
"Where have you been?"
"I was traveling."
"They all disappeared."
"So how does it work?"
"Can we see it?"
"How can I make myself understood?"
"I'll manage on my own."
"He followed us."
"How did you survive?"
"This is my neighborhood."
"What are your names?"
"He takes care of it."
"I'll bring it to you."
"Who are your friends?"
"It was my life."
"Go see a doctor."
"I felt it coming."
"Nobody knows her."
"I'm calling the doctor."
"I am your mom."
"Where are we going now?"
"That would be very good."
"You too, by the way."
"Yes, I got it."
"Do you have a phone?"
"Where is the princess?"
"She attacked me."
"Yes, that would be good."
"It's coming, it's coming."
"I would like to see her."
"Let me see it."
"Let me see it."
"Do you want to join him?"
"Yes, that's correct."
"But what do you want?"
"Is this your child?"
"This is the heart."
"Come on, it'll be fine."
"Are we celebrating something?"
"Just you and me."
"Are you going too?"
"As he said."
"What is your position?"
"I should get there."
"Did you say yes?"
"This is my world."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Do you want to get up?"
"I'm going to finish this."
"Hand in hand."
"Why do you come here?"
"I start the massage."
"No, you don't know."
"It holds up."
"So, what do we do?"
"Give me his number."
"We continue to search."
"We continue to search."
"Where can we go?"
"It's sugar."
"Don't be mean."
"Do you want a cookie?"
"Do you want eggs?"
"This was the case."
"Do you have a pencil?"
"Where is the room?"
"How is the patient doing?"
"Where are we going?"
"It's homemade."
"We saw you."
"Are you here already?"
"You helped us."
"And how are you?"
"And you believe her?"
"Can I borrow this?"
"It's brand new."
"It tastes good."
"They were very close."
"Are you talking to yourself?"
"I wish you that."
"A car is waiting for you."
"She is very sensitive."
"It's TV."
"Are you capable of it?"
"It's really over."
"Absolutely, yes."
"I don't understand this."
"Do you want to rest?"
"I wanted to ask you."
"Does anyone speak English?"
"He's at the bar."
"You were great."
"You were wonderful."
"Can you come here?"
"Have you seen her?"
"Do you really want to do this?"
"He has a son."
"I would like to see that."
"I will carry you."
"Think about your mother."
"Like in the old days."
"Well, if you want."
"Are you finished yet?"
"How much do you have left?"
"It is a sanctuary."
"I wanted to see her."
"I work with him."
"Give me the number."
"I just called."
"She is always hungry."
"Just for a few days."
"Where is the antidote?"
"Have you met her?"
"How many do you have?"
"Do you have any cigarettes?"
"Do you have any cigarettes?"
"She's gorgeous, isn't she?"
"Ask him yourself."
"I can feel you."
"Lunch is served."
"You're exaggerating a little."
"Where did you grow up?"
"Are you going out with him?"
"It was a sign."
"This is my philosophy."
"We'll fix everything."
"Like every time."
"Are you driving?"
"I know, sweetie."
"Are you going to keep it?"
"This is a photo."
"I have coffee."
"Does Mom know?"
"Where is the coffee?"
"Where is the food?"
"He was a soldier."
"How is my mother?"
"Do you want a massage?"
"Hundreds of thousands."
"I don't speak Spanish."
"Can you move over?"
"This is Earth."
"From top to bottom."
"No need to shout."
"Are you telling the truth?"
"I am looking for a job."
"It's power."
"Game, set and match."
"Check this out."
"We have to turn around."
"You see it well."
"It will be a surprise."
"She is in mourning."
"He's so cool."
"Who bought it?"
"Come by whenever you want."
"I would love to see that."
"You have to eat well."
"I know a guy."
"It won't happen again."
"He works for us."
"We'll find her."
"I have a tip."
"My name is Betty."
"Yes, she is good."
"I know that too."
"I say so."
"You are really talented."
"It was a ruse."
"What would I do with it?"
"I can fix it."
"It's really perfect."
"It's a success."
"I'm so happy."
"Hey, are you okay?"
"It's over then."
"The wind is rising."
"What is your quest?"
"Thank you, Mr. President."
"Thank you, Mr. President."
"It's a funeral."
"Do you really have to go?"
"It's your share."
"That's nice."
"You fainted."
"And the other guy?"
"We have a body."
"That's fine."
"What does this have to do with you?"
"He is a teenager."
"Thanks for the money."
"I will be careful."
"Yes, I will try."
"Lean back."
"He's a teenager."
"Do you have a theory?"
"It's your responsibility."
"Wait, I'll come with you."
"Can I have this?"
"I am his boss."
"We deserved it."
"Excuse us for a second."
"Do you want a cigar?"
"Yes, she is great."
"Is this your boat?"
"What evidence do you have?"
"It's settled then."
"I love animals."
"I like men."
"I'm leaving."
"Oh, I like that."
"You know me well."
"Do you find him cute?"
"I had an appointment."
"He liked it."
"She just came out."
"These are my people."
"What did the stars say?"
"You are very sick."
"So, did it work?"
"Where is my child?"
"Give me a minute."
"Yes, we are fine."
"You're a kid."
"He fucked us."
"I will improve."
"He threatened me."
"You need to apologize."
"Yes, we are here."
"I am very proud."
"You are one of us."
"No, it's fine."
"Thanks for the lesson."
"What is your excuse?"
"Is that you, Mom?"
"You should have called me."
"You should come too."
"Your father called."
"I wanted to be there."
"Can you confirm this?"
"This can't work."
"Things to do."
"And where are you going?"
"And where are you going?"
"A businessman."
"Where do I put this?"
"Brothers and sisters?"
"He's coming here."
"Where is Grandma?"
"I love this city."
"Let's go have a beer."
"It's a sedative."
"We're guys."
"God forbid."
"Your sister is here."
"I'm there."
"She defended herself."
"Where are you taking him?"
"Can I speak freely?"
"You've been gone for a long time."
"Where is the hospital?"
"You are the first."
"Where is the package?"
"Here is some water."
"They have the right?"
"He is a journalist."
"Hey, wait a minute."
"She's next door."
"Did you see us?"
"He must be hungry."
"Will you hold out?"
"Come by whenever you want."
"Who were you with?"
"She was so kind."
"A bit like me."
"Can we go?"
"I am happy here."
"It's still possible."
"You are my guest."
"You should take advantage of it."
"Some things are."
"You are my baby."
"You inspired me."
"This place is great."
"Which is good."
"And it's done."
"Come in, it's open."
"Is this really you?"
"Give me your keys."
"It's your handwriting."
"Yeah, looks like it."
"Can you open it?"
"Captain's Log, Appendix."
"I know this expression."
"I'm going to park."
"I love this name."
"Who took them?"
"No one will believe it."
"What does it taste like?"
"Are we there yet?"
"They wore masks."
"I'm staying here."
"You are very brave."
"He knows how to do it."
"I can't see anymore."
"A storm is brewing."
"I brought it."
"Who is your dad?"
"The lesson is over."
"Not the first time."
"What is this?"
"What is this?"
"He is very rich."
"They were just there."
"We saw them."
"And what would that be?"
"It's him again."
"But you've changed."
"How do you find me?"
"Thank you and good night."
"Is it really useful?"
"I discovered it."
"Come on, give it to me."
"Don't you think so?"
"You will not leave."
"It was a fake."
"I was hoping to see you."
"I don't have it anymore."
"Where is the bottle?"
"Come on, I'll take you back."
"But you're right."
"It's in English."
"It is a duty."
"Take a deep breath."
"The conversation is over."
"Do you want something to drink?"
"You have my permission."
"You're going to love it."
"Give me your phone."
"How old were you?"
"You are so young."
"I love this show."
"I will never be able to."
"I ate everything."
"People like me."
"You dance very well."
"I have my license."
"She has no one."
"Do you love me anymore?"
"I betrayed him."
"Come out, both of you."
"We sowed it."
"I have traveled a lot."
"Look in the mirror."
"Look in the mirror."
"I love him so much."
"I have powers."
"I'll wait and see."
"You have mail."
"Do you trust them?"
"It's very quiet."
"Are you sure?"
"I am an admirer."
"Will he wake up?"
"Can I quote you?"
"Don't act like a child."
"I have the girl."
"You already knew that."
"What do I look like?"
"Keep practicing."
"Yes, thanks to you."
"What are you going to say?"
"Do you want a whiskey?"
"We'll take it."
"I have a vision."
"I knew your father."
"I can find her."
"Are you looking for work?"
"I will do the same."
"Do you know someone?"
"You can't guess?"
"Where did you go?"
"Where did you go?"
"Where are you going now?"
"Would you like a drink?"
"We will be seen."
"I want peace."
"Do you have any witnesses?"
"What else do you want?"
"Like all the others."
"A gunshot."
"Where is the file?"
"I was just curious."
"It's a bear."
"This is my last one."
"Someone you can trust."
"Are they talking about me?"
"Where is your costume?"
"That reassures me."
"Where is the water?"
"I love my brother."
"You should stay here."
"Do you want proof?"
"They are angels."
"You're tough."
"I will know soon."
"All right, buddy."
"No trace of her."
"Oh, one more thing."
"He will need it."
"No, it's wonderful."
"War is declared."
"I recognized you."
"I have a baby."
"It's a homicide."
"It's very elegant."
"I was stopping by to say hello."
"You won't say anything?"
"It's going to be tight."
"About that."
"This is my diary."
"I took it down."
"For good reasons."
"Let me talk to you."
"I stopped everything."
"What is the water like?"
"It's going to be okay, right?"
"Bring me your torch."
"It's very old."
"I see the resemblance."
"Have you had enough?"
"I love them all."
"They will come for me."
"What is your job?"
"How many do you want?"
"I'll go later."
"A little courage."
"I will keep your secret."
"You are very quiet."
"Will you let me finish?"
"I feel something."
"I wanted to do well."
"He is very small."
"It's probably her."
"Who is the woman?"
"We do it."
"Good luck with everything."
"Where did they go?"
"Where did they go?"
"I don't sing."
"Take him downstairs."
"You'll have to wait."
"Have you seen them?"
"You are free now."
"So it's you."
"You are an artist."
"I will come back to see you."
"I will come back to see you."
"I have the same one."
"Where is the button?"
"I repeat my question."
"The door closes."
"I think it's cool."
"Do you want the ball?"
"Who is your friend?"
"He is very old."
"And they are right."
"Don't catch a cold."
"Can I touch them?"
"How wonderful."
"He has a wife."
"All right, calm down."
"I heard shooting."
"I really meant it."
"Do you want to go dancing?"
"Let's go party."
"Sorry, I have to go."
"Where is it written?"
"We are good together."
"I'll give it to you."
"You should see it."
"I want to believe it."
"I have to find them."
"Yes, it could be."
"I have a dream."
"That's my signal."
"To pass the time."
"Enjoy life."
"Where are my boots?"
"I can drop you off."
"Yes, it's settled."
"Yes, I know you."
"Are you warm enough?"
"I can imagine it."
"What did you take?"
"Don't you want to go home?"
"Let's go to the bedroom."
"No, I believe you."
"I am the police."
"I took them."
"Yes, in a minute."
"I take my time."
"They grew up together."
"Have you seen him again?"
"Come home."
"I am her friend."
"Okay, you're right."
"No, who is it?"
"We are men."
"I have the card."
"I was acting."
"You must have been dreaming."
"Years of practice."
"You are very good."
"I'll try later."
"They did that?"
"Thank you very much."
"He still has it."
"I was undercover."
"He's a friend."
"That's well thought out."
"This is our territory."
"Is this really you?"
"You love him, huh?"
"Give me an hour."
"Are these real?"
"So, see you tonight."
"No one will believe you."
"That remains to be seen."
"Am I doing it right?"
"She is a princess."
"No, don't move."
"Who is it?"
"I've been there."
"We worked well."
"I just finished."
"What did we do?"
"Who are these girls?"
"I swear I don't."
"A wedding gift."
"It's very sweet."
"She has two children."
"Stay tuned."
"You deceived me."
"We got it."
"Honey, everything is fine."
"Do you know this woman?"
"It's a flower."
"You're forgetting something."
"OK, I'll do it."
"I waited a long time."
"It was a bluff."
"I'm making progress."
"Without leaving any traces."
"May God be with you."
"Where are the glasses?"
"You have to believe it."
"Yeah, that's perfect."
"Are you looking for a job?"
"I want to hear from you."
"It's forever."
"I appreciate your honesty."
"Orange juice."
"Where is your commander?"
"Can I have them?"
"We got to know each other."
"Do you know her well?"
"You can't read?"
"I'm ready now."
"Do you have the keys?"
"You were right."
"Breathe through your nose."
"Hurry up and get home."
"I am visiting."
"Take some."
"Where are my bitches?"
"Who is this child?"
"They are twins."
"Ask him the question."
"It was night."
"And there you have it."
"Do you accept checks?"
"It's pretty close."
"Yes, I recognize it."
"He had to go out."
"It's very moving."
"I'm flattered."
"It's pretty deep."
"You are his friend."
"When did you go out?"
"Good episode everyone."
"You will be very well."
"They are very close."
"Dinner is ready."
"Have a nice day."
"He begged me."
"I am really happy."
"I am a patriot."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"I followed you."
"Oh, that's lovely."
"No, you can't."
"Something special?"
"Have you decided?"
"And he knew it."
"I will withdraw."
"God bless you all."
"Do you know his name?"
"There you have it, guys."
"Do you have anything to drink?"
"I'm going to change that."
"It's a ring."
"She's going to love it."
"Where did she go?"
"It was yours."
"What is your interest?"
"Throughout the country."
"I want a girl."
"You are worthy of it."
"I am the guardian."
"Ah, that's better."
"Do you want to keep it?"
"Do you find me beautiful?"
"Do you have an alibi?"
"Thanks for the dance."
"A tough guy."
"They are professionals."
"They found me."
"The message is clear."
"Did he see you?"
"That's great, Dad."
"It was heaven."
"I wish I had it."
"Of course, sweetie."
"I want to question him."
"There's a bone."
"I have an offer."
"The time has come."
"You are safe."
"What else?"
"Where is his daughter?"
"They are coming for me."
"One of my favorites."
"I'm going to apologize."
"That's good, darling."
"I am both."
"He is with her."
"Nice to see you again."
"It's worth it."
"How did she react?"
"He was wearing a mask."
"It's on the move."
"Where is your uniform?"
"Go up to the roof."
"Do you play the piano?"
"What was going on?"
"I looked at her."
"Not for a single second."
"I have to confess."
"What time is it?"
"Don't think too much."
"It's nice weather, huh?"
"Where is your luggage?"
"How was he dressed?"
"Take it with you."
"How do you want to proceed?"
"I feel sorry for him."
"You are well informed."
"You see that one?"
"I have the flu."
"You have work to do."
"We are at his house."
"That's the reason."
"Life is precious."
"You should be careful."
"You should be careful."
"The dinner was delicious."
"Where do I stand?"
"It's a hobby."
"Don't wake him up."
"I want to know how."
"Where were you before?"
"I forgot them."
"Yes, pass it to me."
"What is it for?"
"What is it for?"
"I'll see you soon."
"Oh, look at that."
"Holy water."
"Look who's here."
"At least once."
"I like him a lot."
"They want your skin."
"And do you like it?"
"They will find us."
"We will follow them."
"What are you shooting at?"
"This is our plan."
"We will do our best."
"You are so smart."
"That's great."
"Will you forgive me?"
"Tell him to come in."
"I don't touch it."
"But that's it."
"I admire your courage."
"Do you have his name?"
"Try to remember."
"Sorry, I forgot."
"A game of cards?"
"Yes, every day."
"It's a robbery."
"I am their father."
"Everything is clear now."
"I had to go."
"What does she mean?"
"Yes, last week."
"What does the people ask for?"
"Put the handcuffs on him."
"Do you see this woman?"
"You all look alike."
"We called him."
"I love it."
"Let's move on."
"I know your name."
"You can ask him."
"Your time is up."
"Where is the plane?"
"We make love."
"Where would you like to go?"
"Do you have a job?"
"Fresh air."
"Do you have any plans?"
"It's a test."
"So what does it do?"
"He's from here."
"They will hear you."
"No, I like it."
"How was school?"
"What is the reason?"
"He was my partner."
"Can anyone hear us?"
"The police are everywhere."
"You can relax."
"My father is a lawyer."
"He organized everything."
"You should think about it."
"How did you get in?"
"What do we know about it?"
"You are all invited."
"It's always you."
"It's pretty serious."
"Do you still love him?"
"It's been weeks."
"Something is different."
"I grew up with it."
"Yes, here we go."
"You should have told me."
"Is that right?"
"What am I?"
"It's not brilliant."
"I don't have."
"Do you find me pretty?"
"How is your back?"
"Does this sound familiar?"
"Is this place free?"
"Where are you?"
"I have my account."
"I'm used to it."
"And what does he say?"
"I am the law."
"I'm going, Mom."
"I have a fiancé."
"One of us?"
"I was looking for someone."
"I was the first."
"Come near me."
"Is this your boyfriend?"
"You know the situation."
"That will have to wait."
"We all do it."
"What do you work in?"
"Did you get them?"
"She will calm down."
"Yes, it's lovely."
"Excuse us for a minute."
"Calm down, girls."
"Not for a single moment."
"It was his son."
"Who is your commander?"
"It was easier."
"I had to say it."
"I have to search you."
"I have to accept it."
"I can protect you."
"The session is over."
"I have ears."
"I call my mother."
"I am a boy."
"Should I dance with him?"
"Maybe I should."
"And the other three?"
"Do you have homework?"
"I will stay standing."
"Settle this between yourselves."
"I have the advantage."
"I still feel it."
"I won't be far away."
"You make me blush."
"Are you going to tell them?"
"Yes, Officer."
"Thanks for the info."
"Don't kiss me."
"He is my lover."
"Good luck, old man."
"It's great here."
"Watch out for the door."
"Don't you understand?"
"What if we left?"
"Yes, it is."
"I wanted to meet you."
"I swallowed it."
"We all have them."
"Make the right choice."
"I like you very much."
"Let me walk you home."
"You have ten minutes."
"I'm taking the day off."
"I can be."
"Have a nice holiday."
"A man, a woman."
"I understand now."
"Have a good evening."
"We're onto something."
"And you are here."
"What would you have done?"
"Welcome to the United States."
"Is this your dog?"
"The session is suspended."
"I think I know why."
"Do this for me."
"Thanks for the ride."
"This is his room."
"I am very talented."
"I keep looking."
"We want to talk to you."
"The phone is there."
"What were their names?"
"I was born there."
"She's in the operating room."
"I see it too."
"Pay attention to him."
"It's both."
"We can handle this."
"Open your eyes wide."
"Or I will."
"The car is outside."
"Do you want to listen to it?"
"Do you believe in miracles?"
"Wait a little longer."
"I like horses."
"What was he talking about?"
"Family first."
"Do you really think that?"
"Do you have the money?"
"Good day to all."
"Now listen to me carefully."
"I pushed her."
"I'll let you guess."
"That's my question."
"My lucky day."
"I'm next."
"Take a deep breath."
"Do you speak our language?"
"I stabbed him."
"It's in me."
"I have to prevent this."
"You have to talk to him."
"Nothing ever changes."
"I buried him."
"And breakfast?"
"I think so, yes."
"I love you for a long time."
"We did everything together."
"That would be great, wouldn't it?"
"You tricked me."
"I am a machine."
"What are you doing here?"
"Where is your ring?"
"She has her period."
"I'll go get it."
"What am I saying?"
"He's sitting there."
"It's New Year's Eve."
"What do you call that?"
"It's your destiny."
"He is still young."
"Absolutely fine."
"We will treat you."
"Go to the hotel."
"Do you have a reservation?"
"You work for me."
"I will find you."
"You surprised me."
"What did you say?"
"What did you answer?"
"Can I call you?"
"We have a mission."
"You are very calm."
"This is my bar."
"You will be well paid."
"This is his child."
"I promised."
"Who will tell him?"
"Dad, I love you."
"Where is he then?"
"Give me your jacket."
"Don't come back here again."
"I will attract them."
"We can always dream."
"No need for you."
"Playtime is over."
"I have a few minutes."
"Who can do that?"
"Is this your card?"
"I felt it."
"Look straight ahead."
"That's the story."
"I know him."
"Who are you with?"
"What can we do?"
"Yeah, that's nice."
"They want to talk to you."
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"Who are you?"
"Where is my ring?"
"He's going to stay there."
"That's it, baby."
"Where is your friend?"
"Quite a few things."
"Do you understand something?"
"I know men."
"Let's move on to plan B."
"I am a customer."
"And it's awesome."
"You can take it."
"What is it about?"
"It must be eliminated."
"I'm leaving again this evening."
"It's the music."
"Not in this state."
"You need to relax."
"Six feet under."
"Get to the point."
"Well, that's perfect."
"From the bottom of my heart."
"Where should I go?"
"I'm going up to change."
"Where is Grandpa?"
"But she's right."
"I love this photo."
"There, it's settled."
"He has a gift."
"They will see you."
"Good night, my baby."
"You know the orders."
"I will behave myself."
"Who are you talking about?"
"Who are you talking about?"
"I almost had it."
"Why does he say that?"
"Three or four hours."
"Wait for me downstairs."
"Do you still see her?"
"How do you find it?"
"What kind of incident?"
"I haven't decided."
"Yeah, that's fine with me."
"We need to talk."
"Who were you with?"
"Why do you have this?"
"Do you have a condom?"
"You are a spy."
"I am the only one."
"Oh, but of course."
"Just the facts."
"It was pretty cool."
"Who wouldn't love it?"
"Nobody understands me."
"I have to find them."
"How old are you?"
"A bounty hunter."
"Less than an hour."
"It was my home."
"It will take time."
"She is too strong."
"What brand is it?"
"Twice in a row."
"The road will be long."
"I can testify to that."
"I think like you."
"What had you done?"
"Top right."
"It's a helicopter."
"Remember what?"
"Take me with you."
"I have to know everything."
"Do you know these people?"
"Do you know this name?"
"Take care of them."
"Give me your sword."
"I wrote to you."
"It's been a long time."
"They are very beautiful."
"It must be exciting."
"Do you have an invitation?"
"Who paid you?"
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"I need more."
"Drink water."
"Do you have any milk?"
"What do I owe you?"
"We've waited long enough."
"I trained."
"Who were you talking to?"
"I want your opinion."
"Where is the stone?"
"Just for a moment."
"What's yours?"
"What's yours?"
"It's a principle."
"The view is magnificent."
"They are like that."
"I love this plan."
"One point for you."
"Your mother is outside."
"I heard."
"Both, I think."
"It would suit you well."
"Happy wedding anniversary."
"She is like me."
"Someone good."
"Where are we here?"
"Do you have a coin?"
"And you love me."
"Do you have a cell phone?"
"Yes, we succeeded."
"Once, maybe."
"I'll take you there."
"Just wait."
"It's a group."
"Go see a shrink."
"Is this your baby?"
"It was very moving."
"I have to protect her."
"It's pretty awesome."
"Leave me alone."
"Hi, how are you doing?"
"Where is my seat?"
"And with your mind."
"I know your reputation."
"Did you believe it?"
"It's your turn to speak."
"Take it easy."
"As far as possible."
"You used me."
"What will I see there?"
"I don't think about it."
"The choice is yours."
"This might be interesting."
"She's pretty, isn't she?"
"We will accompany you."
"It's a ball."
"Go first."
"The man of the moment."
"You know the rules."
"I live my life."
"And for the baby?"
"She is sedated."
"Maybe not enough."
"About what?"
"That's it, thank you."
"Me too, mate."
"This is our wedding."
"Lots of stuff."
"It's already paid."
"Give him something to drink."
"Thanks for the discussion."
"The road is closed."
"You're going to be a father."
"Why did you come?"
"I can arrange it."
"I found you."
"You're going to wake them up."
"You have to hurry."
"Did you rat me out?"
"This is my last one."
"Just like your father."
"Thank you for being here."
"We'll talk again soon."
"I'll ask them."
"You know what, Mom?"
"I found you."
"Not lately."
"What do you gain from it?"
"Let's spend the night here."
"For a good cause."
"Someone is watching us."
"I want a family."
"I'm so hungry."
"At the police station."
"What does the police say?"
"It's a female."
"Be nice to him."
"Who will believe you?"
"How are we going to get home?"
"I was following orders."
"I really appreciate it."
"Who is 'we'?"
"A little to the right."
"We have children."
"How was your flight?"
"I want to rest."
"Can we do this again?"
"Do you have your cell phone?"
"How did you find it?"
"This is my career."
"Luck is smiling on us."
"I like him."
"I believe in God."
"Would you excuse us?"
"Listen to me for a second."
"The people have spoken."
"She invited me."
"How do we do that?"
"What did she look like?"
"Can I have some?"
"I will prove it to you."
"I have everything."
"You were late."
"What were you doing there?"
"Where is the sheriff?"
"I worked well."
"Thank you for noticing this."
"They go well together."
"That's great, man."
"It's almost dark."
"Please."
"It's finally over."
"No, it's fine."
"What was the message?"
"It's a talisman."
"I want a beer."
"Where do you plan to go?"
"Hello, my old friend."
"They are all there."
"Is this the new one?"
"She is very attractive."
"How could it go?"
"Can I wait here?"
"Did you say that?"
"It's very poetic."
"Don't show yourself."
"I had planned it."
"What's up, Dad?"
"No need to come with me."
"Can we talk to you?"
"The block is ready."
"And that's enough for me."
"Did you buy it?"
"I wanted to be sure."
"Can she do that?"
"I work nights."
"Oh, here we go."
"No one will see you."
"So there are two of us."
"That's his plan."
"It's pretty good."
"No, it was great."
"Where is your coat?"
"With all due respect."
"What's he doing there?"
"We have a visitor."
"Not that we know of."
"They are doing very well."
"I'll call you."
"There you go, buddy."
"Thanks, it'll be fine."
"What is it?"
"I can deal with it."
"It was his room."
"And it is."
"He's the owner."
"Go watch TV."
"I want to see everything."
"You are the key."
"I don't know where."
"Do you have a number?"
"That's very reasonable."
"One hundred percent."
"Give us a few minutes."
"His eyes are open."
"And me, in there?"
"We have to move."
"Do you still have it?"
"I'll pick you up."
"She's an adult."
"I won it."
"Mom, I'm fine."
"I was rather busy."
"Put me down."
"Do you want a drawing?"
"I have permission."
"Whose is it?"
"It's been three hours."
"Go to the car."
"That's what's been said."
"Do you have someone?"
"Who do you think you are?"
"He promised it."
"Thank you for your presence."
"Whatever it takes."
"How was the movie?"
"Are you from the village?"
"Sir, is everything okay?"
"That's my goal."
"I just tried."
"But not to me."
"Where did you learn?"
"Is this your car?"
"He told me."
"It's going to be great."
"Thank you for your loyalty."
"Do you have cash?"
"It's the beard."
"It was the best."
"How old were you?"
"Oh, that's amazing."
"What kind of game?"
"No, I forgot."
"How did I do it?"
"I know one."
"Then she left."
"You wanted it."
"No pun intended."
"Stay here with me."
"Can I walk you home?"
"Where are you going?"
"His condition is worsening."
"You are truly amazing."
"It needs to be changed."
"Why are you arguing?"
"Happy birthday, my dear."
"We're going to train."
"Obey your mother."
"Business is going well?"
"But it will come."
"I am Spider-Man."
"What are you?"
"But where is she going?"
"Are you going to see him?"
"You are the eldest."
"Where do you want to go?"
"I love this part."
"It's still daylight."
"I have to be."
"What we want."
"You played well."
"With water."
"Have you eaten yet?"
"But it's you."
"Was I good?"
"We have plans."
"Nobody wants it."
"I begged him."
"She's so cool."
"What do you call it?"
"No, don't come."
"Tell me something."
"I'm looking for you everywhere."
"It's goodbye."
"She got you."
"You do your job."
"But I want to know."
"Do you want to see her?"
"She's really good."
"We are among friends."
"I will find out."
"I'll find out."
"Do you hear the music?"
"Did you invite her?"
"First door on the right."
"Did they see you?"
"Give me that bottle."
"I am a civilian."
"Next to you."
"What you do."
"We all were."
"Did you know the victim?"
"She agreed."
"Do you have a suggestion?"
"Times were hard."
"She hanged herself."
"You woke me up."
"This is my doctor."
"This is the Doctor."
"She is in town."
"Don't be a baby."
"And what do you want?"
"Please leave."
"Are you kidding me."
"What kind of proof?"
"You didn't see anything."
"Something to sort out."
"You are the first."
"When will we see each other again?"
"Show me your hand."
"As you wish."
"He is our leader."
"We have something."
"We have something."
"And money."
"Have you been there?"
"Have you been there?"
"I want to explain myself."
"Do you have the number?"
"You are an artist."
"A fireworks display."
"Who are you, sir?"
"See you on Saturday."
"Where are the toilets?"
"Anything to report?"
"We are scientists."
"He was my hero."
"I know how to do that."
"Are they with you?"
"I had a feeling."
"They said it."
"We'll see you there."
"And for the girl?"
"Like in a dream."
"You did the right thing."
"Proof of what?"
"What was she doing here?"
"Yeah, that's her."
"The divorce papers."
"You are my angel."
"Would you like some tea?"
"You are mine."
"I recorded everything."
"He was a child."
"You have to stay calm."
"It happened yesterday."
"You have to get used to it."
"I have cramps."
"I love animals."
"He is in Chicago."
"All right, kids."
"I'm going to say hello."
"Do you know the time?"
"Is that you, darling?"
"In a way, yes."
"This is my chair."
"But I think about it."
"And I love it."
"While we're at it."
"I'll give them to you."
"I have to fix this."
"He is their leader."
"They still are."
"I have to tell them."
"I'll do it again."
"Where are your friends?"
"You are very handsome."
"Your bodyguard?"
"Would you mind signing?"
"Hey, not so fast."
"Yes, you know what?"
"You know why."
"See you in court."
"Don't give up."
"Long live the new flesh."
"He's probably right."
"The meeting is over."
"It's pouring with rain."
"I wasn't finished."
"Give him a minute."
"I owe it to you."
"You didn't answer."
"I have a boat."
"Go get the ball."
"Call me if you need anything."
"Where are you taking us?"
"It's your idea."
"That was the deal."
"I love your work."
"You're not finished?"
"It could be done."
"I followed them."
"Is this your office?"
"Where is my wallet?"
"Remember this."
"That's your opinion."
"It's really impressive."
"Let's keep a cool head."
"I'll give it to him."
"Shall we have a drink?"
"She's going to love you."
"Does that make sense?"
"You know the story."
"He is a hunter."
"This is my operation."
"We're almost there."
"I would like to believe you."
"She called me."
"I've had enough to drink."
"He is a warrior."
"Where is the boss?"
"Don't you think so?"
"You know the way out."
"That's great, honey."
"I recorded it."
"How many are there?"
"He is a prince."
"They are vampires."
"Were you able to sleep?"
"Are these your friends?"
"Who wants to go?"
"It will be a lot of fun."
"Welcome to reality."
"I'm going out with him."
"Do you want a story?"
"I'm leaving here."
"Do you have a moment?"
"You have a choice."
"I will send it to you."
"My eyes are open."
"When are we going?"
"It's a mirror."
"I'm within range."
"Get ready to jump."
"I'll drink to that."
"Do you know more?"
"He's an alien."
"Do you want to talk about it?"
"Where is this boy?"
"I am very optimistic."
"It's a restaurant."
"That's all her."
"The deal is done."
"I cornered him."
"How old was he?"
"Everything's fine, Dad."
"It's on its way."
"Let's go, girls."
"Do you have any suggestions?"
"You can quote me."
"It will be our secret."
"We'll talk about it tomorrow."
"We'll talk about it tomorrow."
"He will be here soon."
"How could I?"
"Am I the first?"
"That makes two."
"It's the jackpot."
"These are facts."
"A word of advice from a friend."
"He wants to see us."
"I was betrayed."
"Is your wife here?"
"I'm having a coffee."
"How is your girlfriend?"
"Do you see this man?"
"You should be proud."
"You have the right."
"Give me my bag."
"We found her."
"We are with you."
"How is our patient doing?"
"Merry Christmas to you."
"She says no."
"Yes, I know that."
"Do you have a preference?"
"You know that, right?"
"I thought so."
"What's up, baby?"
"Can I see you?"
"I have your number."
"I took advantage of it."
"Let's go to the kitchen."
"I love you, man."
"I will pay you back."
"What was she doing there?"
"Should I go?"
"Who is it for?"
"Goodbye, my darling."
"I cut it."
"What do you work in?"
"He will be home soon."
"But he was right."
"For you and me."
"I'll borrow it from you."
"I want to do this."
"A promise made is a promise kept."
"We were talking about you."
"A phone number."
"Always in the same place."
"He is really sick."
"I have a migraine."
"Everything will be fine now."
"He's almost there."
"But he is."
"His time had come."
"How do you find it?"
"Who sent them?"
"It's a descent."
"I have the file."
"First thing in the morning."
"Make it work."
"He will take care of it."
"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
"And where were you?"
"Let's start from the beginning."
"And where are we?"
"I love this house."
"He is a poet."
"Where is the device?"
"He attacked me."
"Who did you see?"
"She won't speak."
"Who's asking you?"
"That's good then."
"I was right."
"A year later."
"Where is his car?"
"What is the cause?"
"I'm going to buy it."
"Do you speak our language?"
"Just a quick tour."
"That's enough, that's enough."
"You're listening to me, right?"
"What do you know about it?"
"Should I be?"
"Where are your men?"
"I returned it."
"May he be spared."
"I wouldn't do it."
"I would be very surprised."
"We saw her."
"It's really fantastic."
"They are after us."
"I know that face."
"The doors are closed."
"The area is secure."
"He can hear you."
"These are coordinates."
"It's not obligatory."
"In the vault."
"Can I walk you home?"
"It's really good."
"I have to get it back."
"Of course, I know."
"Things are different."
"It must be good."
"We know that well."
"We're talking about you."
"It's a pigeon."
"Do you see this mannequin?"
"Do you want to join us?"
"Don't take him."
"It's a computer."
"I'm done here."
"Everything is mine."
"A love letter?"
"You have a good memory."
"Just wait a second."
"The debate is closed."
"I'm starting from scratch."
"That's an idea."
"I have a gun."
"I would love to meet him."
"How do you know?"
"The survival instinct."
"I have diarrhea."
"Do you care?"
"Where are you going to go?"
"Hurry up a little."
"I am someone."
"She's right here."
"I came here."
"You see, it works."
"It's brand new."
"She will be here tomorrow."
"Do you speak English?"
"You said so."
"Just at the right time."
"I could never."
"This should be fun."
"At the back on the right."
"What is your destination?"
"That's good, son."
"I found some."
"Yes, she is beautiful."
"Do you want to read it?"
"Do you want to read it?"
"We have to do."
"This is my guy."
"Calm down, guys."
"I don't speak."
"You make me puke."
"He lives next door."
"Let's take another one."
"Thank you for the party."
"You're telling me."
"I'm all wet."
"Are they for me?"
"What kind of operation?"
"I'm working on it."
"We tell each other everything."
"What do I believe?"
"Give me a number."
"Is this your phone?"
"You are a child."
"I had orders."
"They are very good."
"Where are you taking him?"
"Say hello to them."
"She is really cute."
"My mother is here."
"What is the police doing?"
"The decision is yours."
"I was called."
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"Does Dad know?"
"Go open the door."
"With or without you."
"We'll see about that later."
"That's it."
"It is very informative."
"Do you take checks?"
"Where did you grow up?"
"Take our picture."
"Was he convicted?"
"Your mother was right."
"You should be happy."
"And next time?"
"Ask yourself the question."
"I have my answer."
"I want some too."
"Are you going to see each other again?"
"I'm asking for that."
"I would like to see you."
"You did a good job."
"I'm going to train."
"I'm on a diet."
"You're welcome, my dear."
"I want this car."
"You are a saint."
"Yeah, pretty much."
"It's an accessory."
"How much do you owe him?"
"It's quite interesting."
"It works wonderfully."
"Did you feel it?"
"You make me blush."
"I'll sort everything out."
"What is your decision?"
"This is my reward."
"This is the minimum."
"Ten million dollars."
"These are memories."
"Where is my kiss?"
"God bless them."
"She is very happy."
"Thank you very much everyone."
"We must take him."
"Are you letting me go?"
"I've got you covered."
"I appreciate your gesture."
"You have to hide."
"I'll cover you."
"I was kidnapped."
"I won't do anything to you."
"We'll fix this."
"You should be grateful."
"She doesn't have any."
"It didn't happen."
"Let him do it."
"Thanks for playing."
"Do you see these birds?"
"He's gone now."
"No, I love you."
"I'll try that."
"Do you know how to fly this?"
"Do you have a cat?"
"Now I'm here."
"I am perfectly calm."
"I have dinner."
"I will stay with you."
"I entrust it to you."
"Yes, it was nice."
"We have a guest."
"We have a guest."
"We were kids."
"You will follow me."
"I will Always Love You."
"I feel different."
"What kind of doctor?"
"Where is our friend?"
"Is the boss here?"
"Come here, big guy."
"It's quite personal."
"They will find him."
"Try to understand me."
"Try to understand me."
"What can they do?"
"I'll finish this."
"Oh, she's here."
"Just a second."
"He is an expert."
"I miss her already."
"Where is the Governor?"
"Except for one thing."
"Yes, I loved him."
"Do you still have it?"
"I have chills."
"Tell him something."
"Do we let him go?"
"This is extremely rare."
"These are my favorites."
"We are still together."
"Stay here, I'll be back."
"There, it's perfect."
"As a friend."
"As a friend."
"They are over there."
"It's your job."
"I fixed it."
"When did he arrive?"
"Ask me questions."
"The house is big."
"Just an idea."
"I had a son."
"I'll prove it to you."
"Who do you want to see?"
"And what is your name?"
"Give me the baby."
"Let's go to the beach."
"It's makeup."
"Thank you, to you too."
"Go to the door."
"Don't be embarrassed."
"For the weekend."
"I'm new here."
"What are you working on?"
"No more questions."
"How many is that?"
"So what are you waiting for?"
"So what are you waiting for?"
"You used me."
"I'm watching the game."
"He has a crisis."
"Are you the director?"
"Do you have a sister?"
"Did they wake you up?"
"Did you receive it?"
"I tried everywhere."
"I want to see mom."
"I would like to thank you."
"He is the owner."
"Did you pay for it?"
"How was dinner?"
"Come, come with me."
"Do you see a difference?"
"I hope to see you again."
"I gave it my all."
"We did everything."
"She was murdered."
"It's a tattoo."
"I'm calling the doctor."
"And your date?"
"We'll come back later."
"He cares about you."
"Where does this leave us?"
"Get in the trunk."
"It's the sea."
"You love me, right?"
"I obeyed you."
"Where are my clothes?"
"Don't you want to play?"
"The test is positive."
"The Sword of the Morning."
"Where are you now?"
"I'm going to take you down."
"We all win."
"I am very excited."
"He's a loser."
"Are you cops?"
"Of course, this way."
"Right now, yes."
"Who is on duty?"
"Where is it?"
"Where is it?"
"I don't read."
"You were late."
"This is really serious."
"I take a look."
"I love you, son."
"And that's it."
"And it will be over."
"It would be a pleasure."
"You have potential."
"We must act now."
"This is his family."
"You can take it."
"They are your people."
"And even so?"
"Yeah, I will."
"Can we leave now?"
"This is who you are."
"You can always try."
"Time travel."
"It won't start."
"I'm looking for answers."
"So what do we have?"
"I like that too."
"I was mean."
"And one for me."
"It's one thing."
"Where is my friend?"
"But I'm right."
"Like many others."
"Do you want bacon?"
"You weren't there."
"Business is going well."
"There is still a chance."
"Can I touch you?"
"Didn't you listen?"
"Do it for us."
"Can you talk to him?"
"She's in the garage."
"This is the kitchen."
"We crossed paths."
"Where is your jacket?"
"Is she talking about me?"
"It's from him."
"Come on, I tell you."
"Once, twice."
"She was so pretty."
"I was in town."
"What could happen?"
"It's glass."
"You have to practice."
"Now it's good."
"You came home early."
"Is my brother here?"
"So how do we do it?"
"We are still here."
"Six months later."
"Go to the car."
"No, it was great."
"Do you understand your rights?"
"Don't be so angry."
"Not that kind."
"Power to the people."
"She's really good."
"You should take this."
"Let's go get some food."
"Yes, he is great."
"Not in the house."
"Who are you thinking about?"
"She was very pretty."
"It's a wolf."
"I haven't started."
"We have them all."
"It was one."
"Now we're even."
"Do you have the results?"
"Can I take it back?"
"Come on, give it to me."
"I love him very much."
"How do you play it?"
"Are you the boss?"
"I'm going to eat you."
"Buy me a drink."
"Did you find it?"
"These are your words."
"Get rid of them."
"You could do it."
"Where do you think you are?"
"I'm calling the police."
"You are online."
"I like the rain."
"What is our position?"
"If you wish."
"I should have called."
"Are you leaving like that?"
"It would be simpler."
"I'm in high school."
"Like on TV."
"Give me a cigarette."
"Give me a cigarette."
"No need for him."
"Shall I let him in?"
"She was a child."
"I defended you."
"Do you know my father?"
"Where is my jacket?"
"He is always right."
"I'll call you back, okay?"
"My father is a cop."
"You are nobody."
"He's the boss."
"You're never here."
"I still do it."
"That's easy."
"I had some."
"Because I can."
"She got married."
"Do you know this boy?"
"Now it's your turn."
"This is my file."
"Very well, my friend."
"It's an island."
"No, I'm fine."
"They are demons."
"It's an intuition."
"Let's see if it works."
"Where is the disc?"
"This is the target."
"And I accepted."
"I appreciate it very much."
"What do you gain from it?"
"I was adopted."
"You think of everything."
"Wait, what are you doing?"
"At your command, chief."
"It's Morse code."
"Of course, Your Majesty."
"Where is my face?"
"I'm getting used to it."
"That's his nickname."
"I was promoted."
"Who is your superior?"
"He'll like it."
"Is it serious, doctor?"
"Let me take you back."
"Ah, that's good."
"Where is the truth?"
"Give me time."
"It won't work."
"I'm leaving with him."
"This is our agreement."
"I know a lot."
"I'm going to like it."
"Who is this friend?"
"Send a medical team."
"Not really, actually."
"One second, one second."
"I am the man."
"Don't do that anymore."
"She is a goddess."
"Would you like a cigarette?"
"Where are the stones?"
"You were."
"Sorry for my delay."
"It was so cute."
"The road is blocked."
"I call my father."
"He's your nephew."
"You have his eyes."
"What to talk to you about?"
"I was just about to leave."
"But where is he?"
"We have to tell him."
"I filmed everything."
"Think about the future."
"A dead end."
"You are the last."
"You have some nerve."
"You have some nerve."
"The park is closed."
"Yes, it's better."
"Do you have my money?"
"This is an exception."
"We receive a call."
"I'm going to the market."
"You are very brave."
"Are you comfortable?"
"He's a star."
"The night is beautiful."
"Glad to be home."
"It's her home."
"But what are you saying?"
"Yes, I love you."
"Who taught you?"
"He was a thief."
"Your birthday present."
"The door closes."
"It was easy."
"Give me the box."
"You look better."
"I sowed it."
"Why are you touching me?"
"Did you feel that?"
"It must be late."
"Who were you talking to?"
"There are still some left."
"Why are you asking that?"
"No, you were right."
"He got us."
"And it's you."
"I'm tough."
"Is this live?"
"What kind of mission?"
"But trust me."
"Give him something to drink."
"And inside?"
"It's plastic."
"It's the same here."
"Do you have a part?"
"I am your boss."
"The truth about what?"
"I have balls."
"Yes, it worked."
"Don't ask me anything."
"They are kids."
"Did you find them?"
"For your own safety."
"I will find my way."
"I haven't changed."
"Isn't he great?"
"Yes, that will be all."
"This is my area."
"I'll talk to him tomorrow."
"They want to see you."
"You have your money."
"It brings back memories."
"I made them."
"I'll fix it."
"I am like him."
"Christmas Eve."
"I can find it."
"Where is the driver?"
"Who's on board?"
"I'm talking to myself."
"Where is my gift?"
"This is the treatment."
"The window was open."
"It's a fish."
"Girls love it."
"If you are interested."
"Do you like your job?"
"Bring water."
"You should do it."
"She is my friend."
"I will follow them."
"We have one hour."
"Why are you fighting?"
"Forgive me, my love."
"They have already started."
"It's good here."
"It was very pretty."
"This is our policy."
"How do you know him?"
"In memory of the past."
"Do you have anything to do?"
"What should I look for?"
"Do you have any photos?"
"She isn't."
"I'm the new one."
"You have to prepare yourself."
"This needs to be fixed."
"We were so close."
"We need to create a diversion."
"They will wait for us."
"Where have you been?"
"I know this book."
"I'll bring this to you."
"Go to the hairdresser."
"This is our specialty."
"She is with them."
"He will come for me."
"Someone special?"
"It's a delight."
"No, I insist."
"He left yesterday."
"You're a good one."
"What if we went back?"
"Give me one."
"Do you want to see this?"
"Who called you?"
"Do you have any suggestions?"
"Not in my lifetime."
"As I was saying."
"I'm faster."
"Your son is fine."
"It's all of us."
"Yet it is true."
"Think about your family."
"Let's agree."
"I want to get up."
"And you will."
"It was really impressive."
"What do you want?"
"I had a daughter."
"We are well placed."
"He chickened out."
"I can talk to them."
"I have talent."
"It's a garage."
"About everything."
"We are doing very well."
"I should get back to work."
"He was going home."
"I can see everything."
"Oh, what is it?"
"You must excuse me."
"Focus on me."
"Do you know how to do it?"
"But what is he doing?"
"He's going to get you."
"Have a good end of the day."
"She will be here soon."
"Yes, we won."
"Fireworks."
"You know very well."
"I don't decide."
"This is my position."
"I have my methods."
"Don't be."
"I have the list."
"Do you want something to eat?"
"Let's go to the police."
"How much are you asking for?"
"That was before."
"And I understand that."
"Yes, I think so."
"See you in an hour."
"And where is it?"
"We have a winner."
"Where is the beacon?"
"I'm here now."
"It must be nice."
"Something has to change."
"Please."
"Yes, he will."
"But I do."
"She's barely breathing."
"The meal is served."
"Where are the women?"
"You're always hungry."
"You made it all up."
"It's healthier."
"What were we talking about?"
"He's an old man."
"Do you still love him?"
"I'm trying to read."
"This will be the end."
"It's Shakespeare."
"It's his phone."
"We think so."
"He is behind us."
"Glad to hear it."
"He's getting out of it."
"I think of you."
"You know the way out."
"Now I remember."
"Not in front of the children."
"Your father is gone."
"What did I miss?"
"Thanks for the ride."
"Here, have a drink."
"No, as usual."
"Maybe he'll come back."
"What did they find?"
"Are you up there?"
"I'm still here."
"In an hour."
"Where is the cure?"
"She must be there."
"Did I talk to you?"
"You're on time."
"Are you home yet?"
"Thank you, that's perfect."
"You are doing very well."
"Everyone knew."
"It was a reflex."
"He's fed up."
"Praise be to God."
"One, two and three."
"I calculated everything."
"And now look at yourself."
"Do you have kids?"
"This is our moment."
"I'll meet you in front."
"Do you have the equipment?"
"We have to go."
"Do you think you're strong?"
"Can you reach it?"
"I was planning to do it."
"You, who are you?"
"It came back to me."
"The message got through."
"Do you like jazz?"
"My name is Leo."
"I remember everything."
"The timing is perfect."
"Come here, sweetie."
"You should know that."
"Do you find me sexy?"
"Give me the keys."
"Do you want to take it?"
"Is this your first?"
"I am Iron Man."
"After that, it's over."
"Until dawn."
"We have the address."
"Did I wake you up?"
"Something for you."
"Where are your children?"
"I'm so excited."
"Can I go home now?"
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
"Where are you all?"
"So it was true."
"Do you want a donut?"
"Evidence of what?"
"What's in it for us?"
"This is his version."
"You should come and see."
"But it's him."
"You're getting old."
"You know women."
"No need to explain."
"It makes me laugh."
"I'll get through this."
"We were talking about you."
"Are you his lawyer?"
"We found it."
"But I know you."
"I'm going to court."
"Have you heard everything?"
"I ask the question again."
"I fixed that."
"Good night, boys."
"I appreciate your gesture."
"Yes, where is he?"
"Nowhere to go."
"He smiled at me."
"Go take your shower."
"Who is the man?"
"You know it now."
"I was starving."
"I'm right behind."
"Isn't she beautiful?"
"No, she's here."
"Try to have fun."
"Do you have a match?"
"Have you seen me?"
"Very well, I understand."
"Where is the Ring?"
"Give me your cap."
"It's a meeting."
"I will heal you."
"You should see her."
"Nothing at all."
"But who are they?"
"I kept it."
"I kept it."
"I wanted to take a shower."
"It's at the bottom."
"But I have to."
"He has to do it."
"Do you like horses?"
"Is that really her?"
"What did she look like?"
"Someone was there."
"Sorry, we're closed."
"Have you noticed?"
"A brain tumor."
"Rise to the occasion."
"Yes, I assure you."
"Don't be mean."
"Do you want to see him again?"
"Can you fix it?"
"But I knew it."
"I thought I knew."
"So, are we having fun?"
"What are you doing?"
"Where is my dress?"
"I find it sexy."
"Not immediately."
"I really loved you."
"Do you have your license?"
"Try talking to him."
"A family affair."
"Are you with him?"
"What is your story?"
"What is your story?"
"Find all the humans."
"My father was a cop."
"Where is my tea?"
"My name is Nick."
"Yes, it's cute."
"He is truly magnificent."
"There are more of us."
"The investigation is closed."
"It needs to be treated."
"I hear someone."
"Otherwise, what's the point?"
"I have the coordinates."
"You were so beautiful."
"This is my heart."
"I have this."
"Who came here?"
"She wants to meet you."
"What do we do next?"
"We'll get along."
"You, you and you."
"He will not survive."
"I was right, wasn't I?"
"You know the law."
"He was my brother."
"It's going to be perfect."
"I called you."
"She won't answer."
"And do you know why?"
"Two of them."
"What did you bring?"
"They released me."
"Where did she go?"
"It's tea."
"I know these guys."
"Where is your partner?"
"What kind of party?"
"It will be for tomorrow."
"So, how are you?"
"I would love that."
"I am your wife."
"The plan is simple."
"What can you do?"
"She's my partner."
"Give me the bag."
"I finish my coffee."
"It was high time."
"A plane is waiting for us."
"They said why?"
"Do I make you laugh?"
"I can find out."
"Do you have a lover?"
"He kissed me."
"This is my store."
"His mother is sick."
"It should be."
"See you tomorrow."
"The question is, why?"
"It's lovely here."
"We have a few minutes."
"Nothing was true."
"You must protect me."
"Return to your rooms."
"I play the piano."
"But I love it."
"Who allowed you?"
"Who was this guy?"
"You ask me why?"
"How do you stand this?"
"They do nothing."
"Maybe even too much."
"Where is the nurse?"
"Time has passed."
"It's our decision."
"Did you receive it?"
"Pay attention to him."
"No, I'm busy."
"Hey, how are you?"
"I can hear them."
"Whoever you are."
"Is that your question?"
"I'm going."
"Go see your mother."
"You'll never believe me."
"She wrote it."
"Try to stay calm."
"I have an explanation."
"Yes, you can."
"Yes, you can."
"I made up my mind."
"You see this guy?"
"Ah, that's it."
"Ah, there he is."
"How am I doing?"
"That's a lot, isn't it?"
"Is this your bag?"
"She was stabbed."
"Maybe a year."
"The interview is over."
"You should ask him."
"I did the same."
"He is five years old."
"I love my life."
"Five horses, five men."
"Are you going to kiss me?"
"Are you going with him?"
"I don't listen anymore."
"What are you here for?"
"No, it's real."
"He was so young."
"Yeah, let's go."
"Do you have a cat?"
"It's back to school."
"I serve my country."
"I explained to you."
"I am his manager."
"What were you doing there?"
"Is it absolutely necessary?"
"I'm going back to work."
"It was your choice."
"Are you home?"
"He understood everything."
"It's a novel."
"I want to be happy."
"What was it called?"
"Enjoy your meal everyone."
"An orange juice?"
"He was your father."
"It will calm you down."
"What are you laughing at?"
"It's perfectly legal."
"That would be nice, wouldn't it?"
"Yes, it does."
"We trust you."
"I was one of them."
"Noted."
"Did you get it?"
"That's it, come on."
"Just like his father."
"We are just friends."
"Have you read them?"
"Do you want pancakes?"
"Talk to your father."
"We liked him."
"Who is your contact?"
"He is really nice."
"It's pretty sexy."
"We all love you."
"Give me a moment."
"Well, not anymore."
"It's my time."
"What is it, Dad?"
"He plays football."
"I want to go with him."
"It will be safer."
"Where is his head?"
"Did she kiss you?"
"You know the situation."
"Without telling me?"
"Do you know how to do it?"
"It's better to leave."
"She needed it."
"I'm still working on it."
"Now get the hell out of here."
"What time is it?"
"Where is my office?"
"She is at home."
"I'll meet you there."
"It's my business."
"And you, can you?"
"Let me ask you."
"Well done, my boy."
"Did you get along well?"
"Come on, come with us."
"You know that yes."
"They must be there."
"I was on vacation."
"I chose you."
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"Where is his wife?"
"Can't you talk?"
"I demand an answer."
"No, I won't go."
"Come into the kitchen."
"Can you call him?"
"Fine, as you wish."
"It looks like a plan."
"This is my card."
"Did you just move in?"
"Let time do its work."
"Do you want to think about it?"
"I come as a friend."
"Road accident."
"But it will pass."
"Yeah, that's right."
"What's the catch?"
"This is the doctor."
"He's having a stroke."
"Just for me."
"I want to talk about it."
"She wouldn't understand."
"I want to find him again."
"I'm going to wash it."
"Previously on Stargate Atlantis."
"I've got your back."
"He is very young."
"All right, old man."
"He is too handsome."
"We make a pair."
"You look great."
"And that was it."
"Are they still together?"
"I was at the bar."
"Maybe an hour."
"Do you have my money?"
"It's concrete."
"Oh yeah, I forgot."
"Next weekend."
"Come on, it's easy."
"I care about it a lot."
"I suffered."
"Test, one, two, three."
"Give me a dollar."
"This is my cover."
"Yes, it's her."
"Where could I go?"
"Don't you feel it?"
"Not inside."
"The question remains why."
"And there she was."
"I changed it."
"Yes, I am fine."
"Spare me the details."
"What do the doctors say?"
"What is its purpose?"
"Stay safe."
"What could I do?"
"Calm down, friend."
"Come see something."
"It's your favorite."
"From the bottom of my heart."
"Where is the sugar?"
"What did you answer?"
"He liked her."
"She has a child."
"This is serious."
"The police are looking for him."
"I will do the cooking."
"I've got everything sorted."
"They don't exist."
"It's so nice."
"That's me, right there."
"The cops are everywhere."
"So, is this you?"
"When necessary."
"See you later, darling."
"I am a child."
"Where is your boss?"
"Do you have any suspects?"
"I was attacked."
"It takes two."
"A bodyguard."
"It was a memory."
"I'll pay for it."
"This is the delivery man."
"Did you like her?"
"I'm up there."
"I really like it."
"I'll leave them to you."
"It's so rare."
"It will soon be daylight."
"Don't tell them anything."
"It surprised me."
"It was worth it."
"I've done better."
"You saw correctly."
"So that's good."
"Do you believe that?"
"I know the code."
"What are you doing here?"
"Who invented this?"
"There is progress."
"We draw lots."
"The best there is."
"Take my picture."
"It's super beautiful."
"And I forgive you."
"Where is it written?"
"She loves you very much."
"When did he leave?"
"That would be ideal."
"It depends on you."
"Everything is fine, really."
"Are you with them?"
"It's tough."
"I warn the others."
"He's a nutcase."
"How does he feel?"
"I have the money."
"I don't see her anymore."
"We all were."
"I am an agent."
"When did you come back?"
"I love babies."
"Are you a robot?"
"That's beautiful."
"Where are they located?"
"Where is the light?"
"How can this happen?"
"I'll take the next one."
"This is the heart."
"Do you have a lawyer?"
"Do you know this song?"
"They are yours."
"Do you find her pretty?"
"Everything will be fine."
"What should I understand?"
"I was seven years old."
"Tell us a story."
"You can let go of me."
"How cute you are."
"I was talking about him."
"And everything is fine."
"We'll find something."
"And how do I do it?"
"You want proof?"
"How are you, buddy?"
"I just landed."
"You have to stay there."
"He is my master."
"That's his first name."
"I have to join them."
"A stone-cutting hammer."
"I seek the truth."
"Yes, I'm working on it."
"Please answer."
"What do you want to know?"
"We will always be together."
"We will always be together."
"I'm so excited."
"My wife and I."
"It's almost over."
"This is my heritage."
"He did everything."
"So what else?"
"Don't let anyone in."
"There you go, I found it."
"Who do you think you are?"
"Where is my beer?"
"But now it's okay."
"I'm going to enjoy myself."
"She collapsed."
"You have to find it."
"It's pretty exciting."
"Where is your home?"
"She has the flu."
"Take it with you."
"We do everything together."
"Like every day."
"Stay if you want."
"Leave if you want."
"I would be too."
"Give me time."
"They want to see you."
"OK, I'll try."
"Do you have the papers?"
"And close the door."
"You see over there?"
"Is it full?"
"A credit card?"
"What do you know about it?"
"Gather everyone together."
"And you believe it?"
"Go to the bedroom."
"Be on your guard."
"You asked me."
"I have to examine it."
"What do you want to prove?"
"Give us a moment."
"I loved my wife."
"Not in my eyes."
"We're splitting up here."
"You are very quiet."
"And I apologize."
"I'll come later."
"I will be."
"We open the door."
"She was great."
"When did you arrive?"
"Tomorrow it will be better."
"No, it's the same."
"People love it."
"It's a waltz."
"I am very excited."
"It's always good."
"I'll pay later."
"Or not at all."
"We have customers."
"I have obligations."
"I washed it."
"Honey, are you there?"
"My parents divorced."
"You stay with us."
"Be a good boy."
"Your place is here."
"He touched me."
"Have you read it?"
"Not for a while."
"Where are you from?"
"What was your mission?"
"I was in bed."
"We are together now."
"Do you want to hear it?"
"Don't come back here again."
"I put it there."
"Is this an offer?"
"Can you cover me?"
"Your mother is waiting for you."
"So what do you do?"
"Get in the car."
"Dad, I'm fine."
"I will do my duty."
"I'm going to drink it."
"Professional work."
"Do you have any proof?"
"Where is it?"
"I take the pill."
"He is in Paris."
"Pure gold."
"Can I go play?"
"What will become of you?"
"Do you see anything?"
"Where did you go?"
"Where did you go?"
"They found us."
"It happened."
"Do you have a minute?"
"Where is the original?"
"She has a family."
"What are you then?"
"Holy Mother, forgive me."
"It was very exciting."
"I'm doing a round."
"How is your hand?"
"This is our priority."
"He will come to me."
"The retirement home?"
"What kind of drugs?"
"I switch to manual."
"Tell me about your day."
"The light is red."
"San Francisco Police Department."
"Where is his file?"
"What are your conditions?"
"Go see for yourself."
"Go see for yourself."
"I have one condition."
"He's gorgeous, isn't he?"
"Who do you work with?"
"Stay here, I'll be back."
"I will find someone."
"You are a fighter."
"Where did they come from?"
"Okay, I get it."
"I have a contact."
"The plane is ready."
"I have to hide."
"They are not here."
"He was my cousin."
"I see people."
"It's going to be okay, honey."
"It depends on the people."
"Who is in charge?"
"What did she mean?"
"I'll come see you."
"What do they call you?"
"I'm sticking to it."
"We must protect ourselves."
"Do you want my skin?"
"I'll have a coffee."
"Sorry about your mother."
"We'll clean you up."
"What am I wearing?"
"Are you going to do that?"
"Give me the bottle."
"The opposite would be surprising."
"What do you gain from it?"
"He is in me."
"Shall we take a taxi?"
"Are you staying a while?"
"I'm over there."
"I have to fix this."
"The perimeter is secure."
"Who sent you?"
"I know, my love."
"Who were you talking to?"
"Okay, you're right."
"Good luck, my little one."
"Go take a look."
"Where have you been?"
"Do you have a tissue?"
"Yes, that should be fine."
"Won't you introduce us?"
"I ask questions."
"I have to be careful."
"This is my first."
"Put your finger there."
"I am a warrior."
"Show me your face."
"We have to go."
"Wake up, man."
"I love this woman."
"Yes, it's great."
"And here we are."
"I'm on Mars."
"Do you have a child?"
"I loved it."
"You have to find her."
"You set the whole thing up."
"This is your destiny."
"I was kidnapped."
"Do you want his number?"
"Do you have a brother?"
"It could be you."
"You are too."
"I have a connection."
"It's the concierge."
"You will do nothing."
"It was to be expected."
"Look inside."
"Take her home."
"Just a little blow."
"That's my feeling."
"We'll give it a try."
"National security issue."
"When I was little."
"I'm in the bathroom."
"Are you taking over?"
"I'm older."
"Where are we taking him?"
"Let me see her."
"He's from around here."
"You have your answer."
"It was good, huh?"
"You have to come here."
"I am a pirate."
"Can you take this?"
"She chose me."
"Did you do it?"
"You must miss him."
"We'll tell you."
"Put this on the floor."
"I know the procedure."
"Oh, she's fine."
"Give me the camera."
"I was gentle."
"Thank you for the food."
"You are my guests."
"What is the job?"
"It's over, man."
"What kind of secret?"
"War is imminent."
"When is your birthday?"
"I will introduce myself."
"I'm really happy."
"I almost made it."
"He is a predator."
"Hello, officer."
"No, I like it."
"It happened quickly."
"And I know you."
"She has one."
"We got to know each other."
"Second door on the left."
"She doesn't listen."
"Tell others."
"We will overcome this."
"What color is it?"
"I have to warn him."
"Do me this favor."
"The hand of God."
"She's having contractions."
"I'm going to make some more."
"I am very good."
"Who is he with?"
"Where do I put it?"
"Where do I put it?"
"He is moving."
"What's up, bro?"
"You have to understand it."
"That's great, thank you."
"Did you talk to me?"
"Do you recognize this girl?"
"I found them."
"I'll call her back."
"You're here early."
"It comes from you."
"Do you want some sugar?"
"I'll let you choose."
"Give me back my key."
"Call me if you need anything."
"Do you want to taste it?"
"Who was first?"
"Something is going to happen."
"What kind of friends?"
"The day will be long."
"If it amuses you."
"Are you still here?"
"You're going to enjoy yourself."
"You know that perfectly well."
"Whose orders?"
"Take care of others."
"Oh, that's fantastic."
"You are a foreigner."
"I was like that."
"It's your business."
"One on one."
"Why is he here?"
"I go back to bed."
"I met them."
"How did you get home?"
"I explained to you."
"That's his style."
"I just want to leave."
"Do you like your job?"
"It was pretty good."
"You're already there."
"Who are you thinking of?"
"You did everything."
"The choice is simple."
"I almost waited."
"Did you find it?"
"How did you get in?"
"It will take time."
"My name is Otto."
"My dream is coming true."
"I have a story."
"You will be fine here."
"Are you going to take it?"
"He is an American."
"Maybe forever."
"One thing is certain."
"I appreciate your honesty."
"She is in good shape."
"Pour him a drink."
"Thank you for the welcome."
"Sorry to hear that."
"She is my age."
"It's gonna be okay, man."
"I like that sound."
"They are almost here."
"What are you on?"
"The Trojan sword."
"Is there any coffee?"
"Thank you very much for everything."
"You don't say hello?"
"Do you believe in destiny?"
"I want his head."
"You know the law."
"Everything is going wonderfully."
"Did you hear me?"
"This is important."
"What does all this mean?"
"When you're ready."
"He is a wizard."
"Where do we put this?"
"Can I call you back?"
"Can you get up?"
"Where are the guys?"
"Think about something else."
"Where is yours?"
"We are his family."
"Get on the bus."
"Do we let them go?"
"Are you comfortable?"
"Do you have a car?"
"His condition worsened."
"She went there."
"What is the bet?"
"Thank you all."
"Yes, in a way."
"Mom, what are you doing?"
"Yes, he knows."
"I am his family."
"I've had better."
"He has character."
"I have a minute."
"Have you eaten enough?"
"I will make it up to you."
"Evidence is needed."
"She's tough."
"I care."
"Oh, there it is."
"Yes, he came."
"We will do our best."
"I was married."
"You're sweating."
"Girl stuff."
"Will you come with me?"
"The elevator is here."
"Is your brother here?"
"And we will."
"I found it."
"Everything's fine, man."
"It's better to wait."
"Where is my boy?"
"Someone is following me."
"How did you come?"
"Nothing of great importance."
"It's going to be great."
"It's really huge."
"They are looking for something."
"He is really good."
"Do you know something?"
"Isn't it fixed?"
"Come sit here."
"Can you call him?"
"This will interest you."
"And you accepted?"
"I am the eldest."
"Shall we sit down?"
"Where is the queen?"
"Do you want to call him?"
"What is it for?"
"Come here, big guy."
"You are my guest."
"I'm new here."
"They called me that."
"You never give up."
"Lower, lower."
"You're a smart guy."
"I've been waiting for you."
"I saw her again."
"How is your friend?"
"How are you, my son?"
"All right, girls."
"I'm letting you go."
"My name is Tony."
"Have you seen it?"
"What is he hiding?"
"Hello, can you hear me?"
"How do you see that?"
"This is my hand."
"Let me call you back."
"Let's go back home."
"Houston, in the dark."
"Can I take it?"
"We don't have any more."
"She is capable of it."
"I cured him."
"He can hear you."
"Thanks for the cake."
"I wish I was there."
"My name is Eric."
"Someone is asking for you."
"We will be safe."
"Are you fed up?"
"Can we hurry up?"
"They are kids."
"Do you want to tell him?"
"Your honor is safe."
"I love this house."
"I will tell the truth."
"You are like them."
"They know something."
"Go to the kitchen."
"No, I do."
"I was napping."
"Do you want to know everything?"
"Are you playing with me?"
"We must bring him back."
"Do you have time?"
"Let's go to the police."
"He is very brave."
"He already is."
"She already is."
"We keep in touch."
"I like them very much."
"It's their specialty."
"I love my daughter."
"Will he get better?"
"They are right there."
"As you like it."
"OK, everything is fine."
"But life goes on."
"I was good."
"I invited them."
"It's the drug."
"I'm coming home with you."
"No one will believe me."
"Do me a favor."
"I'll be waiting for you there."
"Why are they fighting?"
"They are very good."
"Yes, yes, very good."
"Are you eating something?"
"Did you really like it?"
"Do you have my money?"
"You must leave immediately."
"Love letters."
"She never sleeps."
"How will it work?"
"She looks a lot like you."
"Show me the way."
"It's a newspaper."
"You're very generous."
"And your real name?"
"You are the father."
"Our days are numbered."
"Well, I was."
"What have I become?"
"I thought I was doing the right thing."
"I thought I was doing the right thing."
"I have to have this."
"You unmasked me."
"Where were you hiding?"
"You can call me."
"It's fish."
"We will continue later."
"Go ahead, tell them."
"See you soon, guys."
"Not in my care."
"She's awesome, right?"
"I want justice."
"Let me look at this."
"You're welcome."
"I emptied it."
"I'm just saying."
"Have you identified him?"
"I would have liked to stay."
"Sorry to hear that."
"But I will find out."
"Yeah, it was cool."
"And I won."
"Arms in the air."
"He's in the operating room."
"It's a phase."
"You are nobody."
"Do you have any money?"
"Can you see her?"
"Did she believe you?"
"He wants to go there."
"You are heroes."
"How do we know?"
"How do you know her?"
"I'm coming to get her."
"And for children?"
"Give me a number."
"Maybe once."
"I will come to see you."
"They were having an affair."
"You know that too."
"I'm going to say no."
"Who is the mother?"
"Are you going back?"
"For personal reasons."
"They are thieves."
"How did you know that?"
"It's been a long time."
"You have to think big."
"Can you come with me?"
"As long as necessary."
"Are you going to open it?"
"I have an erection."
"The studios are yours."
"And where are we going?"
"Watch your feet."
"That's it, keep going."
"This is my bank."
"I'm a pro."
"What you have."
"How's it going, my girl?"
"How time flies."
"I'm already working on it."
"Go back to your business."
"It's the stomach."
"He's hemorrhaging."
"This is my village."
"Have you noted everything down?"
"What did you eat?"
"Sorry about your father."
"Did we do that?"
"Find another way."
"Do you know how to do it?"
"Come on, I'll show you."
"I love chocolate."
"It's his destiny."
"Not in this house."
"He knows it well."
"How could you?"
"Do you have the keys?"
"Good morning, Mr. Mayor."
"It's pretty close."
"Are you still hungry?"
"Who wouldn't want to?"
"It gives food for thought."
"I promise you nothing."
"End of lesson."
"Don't go."
"God willed it."
"We are on a mission."
"It's a star."
"I have lunch."
"Listen to me a little."
"But I love you."
"And once again."
"What's up, honey?"
"And you succeeded."
"He invited me."
"God's will."
"Who is 'us'?"
"I can't hear anything anymore."
"Who is the author?"
"We have a goal."
"It's very similar."
"Do you know this name?"
"You have to listen to me."
"Is that all you have?"
"It was a mission."
"I speak for myself."
"Can you believe it?"
"I'll give it back to you."
"And now we wait."
"Yes, thanks to you."
"I can fix that."
"It's evening."
"Go join the others."
"Thank you for your trust."
"Are you taking the pill?"
"Seeing is believing."
"We are all brothers."
"Yes, I know that."
"How many do you want?"
"They're used to it."
"Yes, he is cute."
"It's really simple."
"Come, if you want."
"I had a reason."
"I'll keep this."
"Whose is it?"
"Who is this little girl?"
"Who will be first?"
"The school called."
"Do you think that's fair?"
"So it's decided."
"I'm from Texas."
"He is six years old."
"You are well informed."
"Can you tell me?"
"It's a disguise."
"I'll call you back soon."
"He takes his time."
"No, wait a second."
"That's their thing."
"I have a lighter."
"We are adults."
"Did he touch you?"
"Have you seen any?"
"Can I use it?"
"Kids love it."
"He is in front of you."
"Now it's over."
"Say hello to mom."
"I appreciate your frankness."
"You have a visitor."
"I think I understand."
"Class, San Diego."
"You should have called."
"Where are the cops?"
"I'll be direct."
"That will be all, Captain."
"Are they real?"
"I want my mother."
"We're going to town."
"How are you going to do it?"
"Can we go there?"
"That was the deal."
"You have to call him."
"Did you recognize him?"
"Give me a coffee."
"My friends are here."
"I was talking about that."
"This is very important."
"That's exactly it."
"Where are yours?"
"Now it's your turn."
"Nothing stops them."
"Absolutely right."
"It's been four years."
"Since when do you know?"
"You created me."
"Don't be mean."
"Do you play football?"
"Am I missing something?"
"What were you dreaming about?"
"And here's to you."
"This one is different."
"I can reason with him."
"Calm down a little."
"Did you tell him?"
"Did you tell him?"
"It's an assassination."
"Do you see the result?"
"Take me to him."
"They deserved it."
"I have to protect myself."
"Who else?"
"I do business."
"You used me."
"You can kiss me."
"I request a suspension."
"Give me your name."
"Are you really serious?"
"In every detail."
"And it was good."
"She is a saint."
"I am the mother."
"But I think so."
"I love this stuff."
"This is the guy."
"Sorry about this morning."
"I'm super hungry."
"Can I sit down?"
"It's a kidnapping."
"I have it too."
"In the next episode."
"He trusts you."
"That was his thing."
"Two or three weeks."
"And your girlfriend?"
"Are you local?"
"It was so romantic."
"Did you catch it?"
"Do you still have it?"
"Where are they hiding?"
"I know your name."
"Because of her?"
"I'm going to see them."
"Go ahead, my dear."
"How do you want to do it?"
"Except for one detail."
"Don't test me."
"He is very generous."
"Watch out for his leg."
"It is our responsibility."
"I'm getting there."
"Can you go see?"
"Are you free tomorrow?"
"The battle is over."
"What are the odds?"
"Did you hear yourself?"
"Tell me now."
"She's a nurse."
"I know you, don't I?"
"Flight attendant."
"I'm a fan."
"You have to get up."
"I give the orders."
"You already have it."
"The FBI is here."
"He was mine."
"It's me, yes."
"It's still dark."
"You look familiar."
"Where is the wine?"
"They were children."
"Let's go back to the car."
"I ask a question."
"My name is Travis."
"You kissed me."
"What happened?"
"Everything is back to normal."
"Where were you born?"
"I'll drop you off."
"I know you."
"No, they left."
"It's our money."
"I'm in the car."
"Did you leave it?"
"The weather is very nice."
"What kind of experience?"
"Give me the money."
"He collapsed."
"A bribe?"
"My job is done."
"It's made for that."
"Promise me something."
"Does it work for you?"
"I have to do this."
"Like you and me."
"Isn't she great?"
"I'm going to the store."
"He was with us."
"You still are."
"They cleaned everything."
"You are really beautiful."
"We stay in touch."
"Go get some fresh air."
"What if we went out?"
"When did you arrive?"
"Are you there?"
"Do you have a boat?"
"Nobody believes it."
"I have wine."
"Someone called."
"You have to pull yourself together."
"I will announce to you."
"Not in this world."
"You're in good shape."
"Anakin, do you read me?"
"This is our war."
"I'm doing you a favor."
"So far, so good."
"The school is closed."
"I'm looking for someone."
"May they be happy."
"Does he have a background?"
"They are soldiers."
"What choice do we have?"
"When did you get back?"
"Are you walking or not?"
"You have a message."
"How are you guys?"
"We could talk about it."
"What are their names?"
"This conversation is over."
"Have you been there?"
"I have to call you back."
"It was his."
"It's the storm."
"I understand your situation."
"Let him rest."
"Where are the kids?"
"Yes, she is cute."
"That's enough, children."
"No, I don't walk."
"She is so sweet."
"Without telling me?"
"I'll be right here."
"Thank you for welcoming us."
"They are our children."
"It's up to you to judge."
"It's a game changer."
"You are so strong."
"You're an artist."
"Let me be the judge."
"What's the story?"
"You are really lovely."
"You should have known that."
"We can do otherwise."
"She's good, huh?"
"If you allow me."
"Your father was right."
"Where is he then?"
"I care about him."
"You should do the same."
"You must know this."
"I am so happy."
"I made that up."
"You look a lot like him."
"Wait and see."
"Can you hear me well?"
"This is the tree."
"He's buying time."
"We wonder."
"It's very classy."
"And what do you think?"
"Like a date?"
"We should let it go."
"Go ahead, my daughter."
"They don't want to."
"I like it here."
"Hey, is everything okay?"
"A rose of twilight."
"I can pay you."
"Come back inside."
"Nobody lives here."
"My name is Trudy."
"I'm really happy."
"No, I love it."
"You have one hour."
"When did you get back?"
"Tell me good luck."
"I listened to you."
"He is regaining his strength."
"How much does it cost?"
"He suffered."
"A chance of what?"
"They want my skin."
"I'll remind you."
"It's too powerful."
"How did she know?"
"There will be."
"My heart is racing."
"It's super sexy."
"You should listen to me."
"Keep a cool head."
"Where is the priest?"
"You don't think so."
"We are aware of this."
"It's very tight."
"What were you going to say?"
"How did you get home?"
"How did you get back?"
"I was going to go there."
"Did you like it?"
"Do you want to see me?"
"You'll never get there."
"He is nine years old."
"I'm going around in circles."
"It's all written there."
"We can talk here."
"Can you take us?"
"Do you want a room?"
"I'm not touching you."
"One of the best."
"You've got it all planned out."
"He will love you."
"Yes, we are ready."
"Where is your boss?"
"Where is your boss?"
"Whose is it?"
"Yes, I see."
"And maybe not."
"Will you call me tomorrow?"
"It was cut."
"How should I do it?"
"I had your word."
"It's your destiny."
"Both, actually."
"It's gonna be okay, baby."
"Where is the party?"
"Turn it on."
"They will hear us."
"What did you hear?"
"Where is the helicopter?"
"Give him time."
"It's a box."
"Do you want to marry me?"
"Everything can be arranged."
"If only I knew."
"What does he know about it?"
"Are you here too?"
"I'll bring the car."
"One and a half million."
"You are very intelligent."
"You are so beautiful."
"He's a leader."
"He's still there."
"I trained him."
"So who am I?"
"And how do I do it?"
"Do you see the picture?"
"What were they talking about?"
"What are you into?"
"My father is waiting for me."
"What is your dream?"
"Very well, my boy."
"Do you feel ready?"
"My name is Jennifer."
"He is in front of me."
"That's very wise."
"She should be here."
"He works miracles."
"My name is Abby."
"It was his decision."
"Give me your word."
"Glad to hear from you."
"You are a witch."
"He was a kid."
"Who will be next?"
"No, no, I understand."
"It must be done."
"Everyone here."
"Do you have a cigarette?"
"Not for real."
"Yes, she is pretty."
"It was so good."
"It was so good."
"Sorry I'm late."
"This is your world."
"The police are looking for you."
"To be with you."
"When it's over."
"It's beautiful outside."
"Not from me."
"How did you say?"
"Are you sleeping with him?"
"Judge for yourself."
"Why are you coming here?"
"You have to be patient."
"Oh, that's great."
"Do you want to touch me?"
"That's enough for me."
"How much do you need?"
"It's all black."
"I have already won."
"Sorry, I forgot."
"Fruit juice?"
"It comes back to me now."
"No, it's clear."
"Give me a few days."
"I will come back tomorrow morning."
"Your friends are here."
"We took it."
"I have a word."
"You sound like him."
"Welcome to the island."
"I'm almost there."
"My parents are here."
"No one can."
"That's a good find."
"Do you have friends?"
"And me too."
"Fix it a little."
"It's hot there."
"One of my favorites."
"Blessed be the fruit."
"You can wait here."
"Go on, have fun."
"You're a kid."
"I can't find them."
"We'll take care of it."
"I'll take the bus."
"You don't think."
"We are at the table."
"I will follow you."
"That was his plan."
"It's noise."
"But is it true?"
"He was so small."
"Who taught you?"
"She lives next door."
"It's really fascinating."
"What do women want?"
"No, on this side."
"Where are the soldiers?"
"Let's go, right?"
"How are you down there?"
"And how are you?"
"You are the last one."
"No, not at first."
"I have a result."
"No, but I do."
"Do you want a blanket?"
"I will come back for you."
"I thought I was."
"Why did you look?"
"I am an American."
"I love this girl."
"Give us a chance."
"Something wonderful."
"Who will you believe?"
"What kind of photos?"
"Who brought him?"
"Would you really do it?"
"So good?"
"Don't ask me that."
"Why do you love me?"
"He is seven years old."
"You have to think about it."
"What were you talking about?"
"I was over the moon."
"A man like me?"
"You must know him."
"He has children."
"Shall we play cards?"
"How are you, my dear?"
"I found better."
"I will explain everything to you."
"I think I know where."
"You have to be there."
"That's easy to say."
"They found her."
"They are people."
"You don't drink anything?"
"This is my method."
"Who saw it?"
"You fainted."
"How could that be?"
"It's never easy."
"This is my garden."
"He's super cool."
"This is my project."
"We'll go home."
"You are like them."
"Show me your shoulder."
"I will never forgive you."
"You need to get treatment."
"I liked it."
"And how much does it cost?"
"It's over now."
"Put it on the ground."
"Who organized this?"
"They always do that."
"And what does it say?"
"We'll talk tomorrow morning."
"Were you looking for something?"
"Can someone explain to me?"
"It's all for you."
"Someone for you."
"Have we seen you?"
"N.J. Turnpike"
"I'm a regular."
"Have confidence in yourself."
"Raise your right hand."
"What are you laughing at?"
"Yes, I succeeded."
"You have balls."
"It depends on who it is."
"It was implied."
"Next left."
"Whatever you do."
"They are for you."
"Have you tried it?"
"We can hide."
"Are you going to answer me?"
"But to go where?"
"You were perfect."
"She's still there."
"Hey, where are you?"
"Life is long."
"Do you want to see this?"
"Missile still approaching."
"Where is the box?"
"You have to get used to it."
"Are you offering it to me?"
"Is everything okay, doctor?"
"Where can we talk?"
"I was with you."
"You are the only one."
"I would have said yes."
"That was my case."
"A fairy tale."
"We offer it to you."
"Sorry, I have to go."
"How would I know?"
"It's my night."
"She left."
"And they know it."
"You must be starving."
"You must be starving."
"I know, my heart."
"It's a journey."
"It goes further."
"He just passed by."
"It's really amazing."
"Give me a reason."
"What am I going to say?"
"See you later, buddy."
"He found us."
"You'll have it tomorrow."
"I already answered."
"Our decision is made."
"It's all yours."
"But I will come back."
"Do you know the news?"
"I can accept it."
"He is a musician."
"I am a specialist."
"I have some savings."
"The news is good."
"I am your queen."
"Just drive."
"You can withdraw."
"He is my brother."
"You must be cold."
"If it helps."
"Tell me a story."
"You are a legend."
"I will repay you."
"I don't do drugs."
"But it was good."
"It's a blue."
"The man of the day."
"It happened again."
"Thank you for listening to me."
"That's my goal."
"I would like to rest."
"You're used to it."
"This is super important."
"Did he talk to you?"
"I will miss them."
"I'll come see you."
"Yes, I would like that."
"Do you have any clients?"
"What is the solution?"
"May God hear you."
"They are beautiful, aren't they?"
"It's a head."
"My father died."
"There you go, you know everything."
"And you, my dear?"
"Did you hear them?"
"Is this your card?"
"Because it works."
"It's your day."
"I will come with you."
"Yes, I swear."
"I am the manager."
"You smell very good."
"Give me a phone."
"How much did you get?"
"I withdrew."
"It's you again."
"You set the whole thing up."
"Do you see the light?"
"He is making an effort."
"Three deposits tonight."
"Bigger than what?"
"We'll bring him back."
"I want this role."
"That's your business."
"Not one more."
"You're not going up?"
"Is it warm enough?"
"What is the rating?"
"Drink plenty of water."
"Well, I'm fine."
"It's Chinese."
"I appreciate the offer."
"Do you live around here?"
"Was he your husband?"
"It was a deal."
"He's our guy."
"They will be here soon."
"I didn't follow."
"What do you suggest?"
"It's been so long."
"Come take a look."
"She couldn't."
"I like her."
"I helped you."
"It's going to be okay, son."
"Nothing very important."
"Will you come with me?"
"Here we are."
"I'm always serious."
"My name is Tim."
"You took an oath."
"Do you know the latest one?"
"Here's how it works."
"You've changed so much."
"I have the papers."
"They are waiting for my order."
"I'll work on it."
"It's a reality."
"I can explain that."
"Where is she then?"
"It's really hot."
"Go ahead, take it."
"Are you coming to pick me up?"
"What were you doing before?"
"A very good friend."
"Wherever it is."
"Victory was near."
"Who else knew?"
"I will convince him."
"How far will you go?"
"Let's go for a walk."
"What was I talking about?"
"How much are we talking about?"
"Then I understood."
"How would that be possible?"
"The evidence is there."
"And other things."
"They are coming for us."
"I know all this."
"This one is pretty."
"I have a doctorate."
"Do you want pancakes?"
"Come here for a moment."
"Do you have a microphone?"
"What should he do?"
"This is perfect timing."
"Would you agree?"
"Madam, can you hear me?"
"Mom, is everything okay?"
"One minute, one minute."
"I understand your reaction."
"My compliments to the chef."
"You are a pearl."
"She'll do."
"What you do."
"Do you have any paper?"
"Stay where you are."
"I want your opinion."
"We should talk."
"This is my invention."
"Where is my truck?"
"My father's."
"You do nothing."
"Did you go back?"
"Show me your eyes."
"He's a regular."
"Have you changed?"
"They are coming towards us."
"I would love to go there."
"And I meant it."
"She's super hot."
"So you know what?"
"I know her."
"Calm down, my dear."
"There, there and there."
"It was the right one."
"I'll drop you off."
"Would you tell me?"
"Do you have a towel?"
"What do you want then?"
"You found me."
"But what are you doing?"
"Welcome to the jungle."
"I am grateful for that."
"This is our road."
"I am human."
"Is she seeing someone?"
"Come and see over there."
"I was there too."
"It was my job."
"Where did it happen?"
"Both are fine with me."
"Where is my card?"
"That was almost it."
"Do you have a match?"
"Come in, it's open."
"We have a market."
"Bring him over here."
"And how do we do it?"
"And how do we do it?"
"But I know him."
"Go there first."
"Give me your address."
"Promise me you'll come back."
"We do this together."
"I was acquitted."
"You get noticed."
"It's more efficient."
"The operation is canceled."
"How are you, Dad?"
"How is your husband?"
"She wrote to me."
"Did you go there?"
"I am the director."
"You are our hero."
"Can you lend it to me?"
"What kind of deal?"
"How are you doing?"
"Well, if you want."
"Thank you and have a nice day."
"My reputation precedes me."
"With all my love."
"This is your domain."
"Yes, I think so."
"From all over the place."
"This is the entrance."
"It happens to me sometimes."
"I can't now."
"I will pay attention to it."
"You did well."
"Yeah, here we go."
"She will tell you."
"Let me drive you home."
"And the other part?"
"I see his face."
"What's happening to him?"
"I expect it."
"Do you have a first name?"
"Hey, where are you going?"
"I really believe it."
"How's work going?"
"I lived here."
"You are absolutely right."
"You are absolutely right."
"Thank you for your understanding."
"Did you look carefully?"
"This is my group."
"She was poisoned."
"I'm going to hang up now."
"Did you see this?"
"Did you have any?"
"The bets are on."
"Who do we start with?"
"I want proof."
"Archer to T'Pol."
"If I have what?"
"Everyone loves it."
"He's a character."
"I loved your father."
"Pour us a drink."
"Don't believe her."
"I will keep your secret."
"I admire your passion."
"Do you mind?"
"What were they doing here?"
"I'll be upstairs."
"You can sleep peacefully."
"I am a Cylon."
"Morning, noon and night."
"I know very well."
"We must stay together."
"Good evening, officer."
"Yeah, all the time."
"One point for me."
"How did you find it?"
"As friends."
"They are ghosts."
"Good luck, my boy."
"He really loves you."
"A little light."
"In a short time."
"What should we do?"
"We'll ask him."
"Who was on the phone?"
"Everything is for sale."
"It's quite surprising."
"Are you on duty?"
"Do you work for them?"
"I love your breasts."
"When I was young."
"You have two days."
"I'll be home soon."
"I can't do it right now."
"Do you have a lighter?"
"That's great, honey."
"It looks like a dog."
"End of scene."
"He'll get used to it."
"What's up, boss?"
"You don't know her."
"It must be awesome."
"Do you want a Coke?"
"She's a kid."
"I was so happy."
"They're good, aren't they?"
"Who wrote it?"
"I'm going right."
"Give me a second."
"Do you take sugar?"
"I'm going to examine you."
"How could he have?"
"Say what to whom?"
"I improved it."
"Are your men ready?"
"Is this from you?"
"What did they take?"
"I introduced myself."
"Your ID?"
"Are you cooking?"
"That's right, yeah."
"Four or five hours."
"Nobody deserves it."
"Where is my book?"
"It's prettier."
"The sons of bitches."
"It's really fun."
"It seems normal to me."
"I have your number."
"Do you have a receipt?"
"You should see her."
"He is a handsome boy."
"Can you pass it to me?"
"It's very ingenious."
"We need to think about it."
"Do you want to go back?"
"Don't be shy."
"Don't be shy."
"Can we see them?"
"You are really beautiful."
"Where do you think you are?"
"She is really talented."
"Who is the boss?"
"You are very intelligent."
"You are very intelligent."
"Do you know this story?"
"No, he's gone."
"Training is over."
"Want details?"
"Do you want fries?"
"She is in surgery."
"I was a kid."
"I have your money."
"Who is it then?"
"Right, girls?"
"Go there yourself."
"I hear noise."
"Hey, calm down."
"I wouldn't know."
"I want my wife."
"It's a laptop."
"A telegram for you."
"A week or two."
"Do you recognize anything?"
"So keep your secrets."
"It's a radio."
"Did they find him?"
"Here are two more."
"I see things."
"What are you?"
"Everything is different now."
"You're all red."
"You were right."
"I want an apology."
"I take the stairs."
"What do you really want?"
"A little late, isn't it?"
"As you wish, sir."
"Can I speak frankly?"
"Yes, they do."
"Yes, we were waiting for you."
"It's very stimulating."
"It still is."
"He agreed."
"He was so cute."
"I was assaulted."
"Is this your handwriting?"
"It looks like a baby."
"He got up."
"No one called."
"Another satisfied customer."
"Do your best."
"He is behind you."
"You sold me out."
"I have to protect you."
"Do as usual."
"This is a quote."
"I'm fine, yes."
"So go home."
"What is the treatment?"
"How do I get out of here?"
"He is at the office."
"I'm selling the house."
"Should I believe you?"
"You helped me."
"I'm going to Paris."
"Is this a sandwich?"
"This interview is over."
"You are in mourning."
"So, that's perfect."
"We broke up."
"It's beyond my skills."
"You are next."
"I betrayed you."
"When will it be ready?"
"That's right, sorry."
"That's right, sorry."
"What kind of boat?"
"You said it all."
"You're right, sorry."
"We're having a good laugh."
"Here's another one."
"I could be."
"It's Grandma."
"As you please."
"I was invited."
"It's his party."
"I have a source."
"We can start now."
"I will be happy."
"I don't recognize you anymore."
"In a word, yes."
"He is quite right."
"It's very comforting."
"How do I find it?"
"Can we do it again?"
"Only two months left."
"I will make an effort."
"Shall we go to dinner?"
"I want some."
"But here's the thing."
"Are you going somewhere?"
"I'm celebrating."
"We just moved in."
"Second door on the right."
"Fresh meat."
"We have to stay here."
"I'm going to kiss you."
"You are the king."
"This is the room."
"Where are your men?"
"So that's it?"
"Out of town."
"You too, I hope."
"What will happen?"
"Stay if you want."
"Thank you for your participation."
"Make me an offer."
"When it's all over."
"So it's true."
"I like this plan."
"Go home, madam."
"And I thought."
"It's appropriate."
"I take the keys."
"I think about it, yes."
"I raised him."
"How is your knee?"
"Hold it like this."
"That was my goal."
"We are all here."
"They will find us."
"I take the money."
"I'll tell you."
"How do I know?"
"Yes, I understand you."
"Everything's fine, huh?"
"I really like her."
"What was I supposed to say?"
"I like it."
"You won't go."
"I didn't understand."
"You do it like this."
"I really love you."
"She's like you."
"Shall I wrap it for you?"
"You have been."
"That's the title."
"Do you care?"
"Finally, we meet."
"My dear, are you okay?"
"It was great, wasn't it?"
"Thank you for your honesty."
"Yes, I hear it."
"What is your mission?"
"It can't."
"You imagine things."
"You can take them."
"I think it's beautiful."
"And I want it."
"Don't get too excited."
"What do we have left?"
"Where is she, Mom?"
"Do you know his name?"
"Next to me."
"In one piece."
"He wrote to me."
"Where is the senator?"
"I know people."
"Let's go upstairs."
"We trust you."
"Yes, I see you."
"I'm going for a walk."
"Take care."
"It's like before."
"It works pretty well."
"We eat well there."
"How to do it?"
"Where is the mayor?"
"I have to bring her back."
"She's somewhere."
"They all came."
"Do you like birds?"
"It must be great."
"It's his heart."
"You're back."
"It was the first."
"It's a whole."
"Okay, calm down."
"Don't answer him."
"Caught in the act."
"It's been six years."
"We're going to clean this up."
"We have a visual."
"Gentlemen, thank you."
"It's a competition."
"It's really easy."
"So we will meet again."
"We need to discuss this."
"My mother's."
"Are you finished yet?"
"Yes, as usual."
"I'm the only one."
"You're a leader."
"It's mom's."
"This is the guy."
"Send me the address."
"Are you on guard duty?"
"It was really cool."
"She worked for me."
"The light is green."
"I can wear it."
"Sword plate activated."
"No, I want it."
"Nobody saw it."
"It would be easier."
"She is very shy."
"Take me to him."
"She is in bed."
"I'm leaving the group."
"Don't come back here."
"Are there any more?"
"No one is perfect."
"It's their business."
"He worked for me."
"Three times a week."
"Thank you for inviting me."
"It's more serious."
"It's metal."
"Nobody is looking at us."
"Are you dreaming or what?"
"Hey, how are you?"
"Hey, how are you?"
"The house is spotless."
"Any luck?"
"I wanted to introduce myself."
"This is the address."
"Just listen."
"Well, I thought so."
"You are very young."
"She saw us."
"Do you want a pen?"
"Welcome to the building."
"That's nice."
"I will stop them."
"I knew him well."
"He's a tough guy."
"I lived there."
"You would have done the same."
"Just one last thing."
"What size are you?"
"Do I make you laugh?"
"I walk with you."
"It will be done, my lord."
"You would like that, wouldn't you?"
"Honey, where are you?"
"I really have to go home."
"That remains to be proven."
"Yes, it's interesting."
"Do you want to go to dinner?"
"Like so many others."
"I no longer exist."
"There you go, that's perfect."
"How do you feel?"
"We can always hope."
"She is our friend."
"She is expecting a child."
"Put on some music."
"You were fantastic."
"I have a rule."
"They are found everywhere."
"Our time has come."
"You're always hungry."
"There are more of them."
"I thought so."
"It's not sexy."
"I like your smell."
"Good luck, my dear."
"This way, I think."
"You are so cute."
"Give me more."
"Yes, in the kitchen."
"And the little girl?"
"Every last penny."
"For helping me."
"You don't love anyone."
"You've got guts."
"One thing escapes me."
"Everyone, listen up."
"I'm going to love this."
"My name is James."
"I'll follow her."
"Thank you for participating."
"My phone number."
"I take classes."
"We are a group."
"I love your mother."
"Good afternoon, ladies."
"Are you serious?"
"Is this a fact?"
"I'm watching over you."
"Excuse me for a moment."
"Think about your son."
"Think about your son."
"To tell me what?"
"Did I do it?"
"As much as you want."
"She's his sister."
"It's the light."
"Yes, they are."
"This is my restaurant."
"Hold his hand."
"Give me your arm."
"What is your opinion?"
"You're not sure?"
"She will change her mind."
"I had to improvise."
"I open my eyes."
"I take the top."
"Let's go to the living room."
"I owe you everything."
"How do you play it?"
"Thanks for the walk."
"This is the real one."
"Do you have a joint?"
"But what are they doing?"
"That's his role."
"I can still hear it."
"I never know."
"Just a second, guys."
"Wait, don't go."
"What will become of you?"
"What did he see?"
"An engagement ring?"
"I find it romantic."
"Can you come with me?"
"I have to be there."
"I will be at home."
"You don't have anyone?"
"When I was a kid."
"I'll pay you tomorrow."
"Where is your friend?"
"He stays with me."
"Are you from the neighborhood?"
"We saw each other."
"I'll meet you outside."
"The signal is good."
"I forgave him."
"I turn off the light."
"More beautiful than ever."
"Everyone will understand."
"That's an argument."
"She can do anything."
"Yes, we have some."
"Everything is OK."
"Where are you, darling?"
"What are you asking me?"
"What are you going to say?"
"She's still there."
"It happens to the best of us."
"Why this sudden interest?"
"Where is the head?"
"Have you made your decision?"
"Very well, I accept."
"But I succeeded."
"Who did you call?"
"He was with her."
"How's your nose?"
"Where is he?"
"Do you love your father?"
"Where is the driver?"
"Someone is waiting for me."
"Don't write that."
"You impressed me."
"Go get your father."
"She takes care of it."
"It has just begun."
"You liked him."
"We must be patient."
"Do you have a beer?"
"This is my condition."
"Leave him alone."
"Yeah, it's going well."
"I am the best."
"You have to see this."
"I'll have it tomorrow."
"You must be happy."
"You must be happy."
"I only have you."
"I married you."
"The world is vast."
"Where are we going to go?"
"Do you want to marry her?"
"He's holding something."
"It's a tunnel."
"What did you do?"
"I'm almost ready."
"It's really good."
"That makes one."
"How much did you pay?"
"What was needed."
"Glad to hear it."
"That's fair enough."
"We receive a signal."
"I said thank you."
"Yes, just a second."
"Don't say that."
"And where am I going?"
"You owe me."
"She's your aunt."
"And that's important."
"Is your mother here?"
"Ah, no, no, no."
"I will be behind you."
"I'm telling a story."
"Are you writing a book?"
"Our paths separate."
"Are you coming to bed?"
"What is their plan?"
"It's the altitude."
"It's pretty impressive."
"Where am I?"
"It leaves me perplexed."
"Thank you for your childhood."
"How is your sister?"
"You can tell him."
"I like to live dangerously."
"Do you have time?"
"I'm talking about him."
"The Wizard of Oz."
"Were you having an affair?"
"They followed me."
"I wish I had some."
"I love the view."
"I'm a lead."
"It must be her."
"Your life depends on it."
"I was helped."
"It ends here."
"I asked for it."
"This is your future."
"You will follow me."
"Pass me a cigarette."
"This is our captain."
"I peed."
"You know the truth."
"He is very famous."
"I signed up."
"This is the police station."
"It's going on."
"She wants something."
"I'll keep an eye on her."
"How did you succeed?"
"This is my wish."
"Didn't you notice?"
"No need for more."
"Where are you then?"
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"You have two options."
"Who allowed you?"
"I love this dress."
"It's okay, man."
"About me?"
"We are his parents."
"You have to open it."
"Someone important."
"Did you believe it?"
"Of many things."
"Do you have a list?"
"So much the better, so much the better."
"Where are the horses?"
"I'm going to take my leave."
"They must be punished."
"It was fun, wasn't it?"
"It's a birthday."
"Take him home."
"The coffee is good."
"I was patient."
"And other stuff."
"You promised."
"I have to call you back."
"Yes, it is."
"What do you mean, you're leaving?"
"I asked you."
"How do I do it?"
"She is early."
"See you this afternoon."
"A phone call."
"Are these your parents?"
"This is my editor."
"I was careful."
"I'm going to have to go."
"He was my patient."
"You will find someone."
"Will you listen to me?"
"This is the boy."
"Which reminds me."
"They are foreigners."
"They are parasites."
"Let's go see a movie."
"We'll talk to him."
"We can do business."
"We are the first."
"I want to be me."
"Don't look down."
"It's going to be amazing."
"Do you want my seat?"
"Thank you for supporting me."
"Are you going now?"
"Yes, I'm interested."
"Your mother is right."
"I have two sons."
"What kind of friend?"
"A little something."
"When is it from?"
"Who are you?"
"You see it well."
"It's even better."
"And you like it?"
"Give me the towel."
"We have to stop everything."
"How could they?"
"I was unfair."
"It's going to be okay, Dad."
"We are a couple."
"I repeat the question."
"Have a good time."
"Yes, we are there."
"Yes, we know each other."
"I'll see about that tomorrow."
"Do you want to tell them?"
"Why do you have it?"
"You have to admit it."
"Is that legal?"
"Oh, as usual."
"You will have your chance."
"I raise my glass."
"I can take you."
"Where is your car?"
"Did we follow you?"
"Yeah, she's fine."
"It was the other one."
"If I can do it."
"Do you want to go see?"
"It was canceled."
"It's behind us."
"He's almost finished."
"That's my nickname."
"I'll do the same."
"Wake up, old man."
"Tell him yourself."
"I live nearby."
"I'll get rid of you."
"It's so sweet."
"It's written on it."
"I'm going up to bed."
"My answer is yes."
"How do we find it?"
"I had to talk to you."
"It's an invasion."
"Do you find me pretty?"
"But where are you going?"
"For many reasons."
"That's all, thanks."
"Will you be able to behave?"
"How did you get back?"
"I am a gamer."
"Where are the cars?"
"And the other guy?"
"He was a gentleman."
"I'm going to have fun."
"I would like to believe you."
"And she is beautiful."
"Pass me a towel."
"About half an hour."
"A letter for you."
"So, are you going?"
"Oh, yes, I know."
"Make me a promise."
"Pass me the towel."
"He was very good."
"You are his friend."
"I'll pay you back."
"And that's it."
"It's a sum."
"Let me be clear."
"We're a team, right?"
"Can I go back to work?"
"I had a friend."
"That's the order."
"We will let you know."
"He had a choice."
"You already have it."
"He says yes."
"I love this one."
"Don't even dare."
"I looked carefully."
"I love this job."
"Mom, what are you doing?"
"I wanted to congratulate you."
"She was great."
"What size is it?"
"Is it that fast?"
"But I thank you."
"Do you want a sip?"
"They are friends."
"I sell insurance."
"He's a copycat."
"They are so young."
"And it's free."
"We are his friends."
"The bank is closed."
"This is our city."
"I have permission."
"What are you implying?"
"Nothing is written."
"May I ask a question?"
"How will it end?"
"Do you have a dog?"
"She has your eyes."
"We are doing very well."
"I'm leaving with them."
"He has the profile."
"In police custody."
"Someone is waiting for you."
"You're a star."
"This is my land."
"No, you stay here."
"Just now."
"It's very special."
"It will be like before."
"She won't do anything."
"Take my hand."
"I've been attacked."
"Who drew this?"
"I make tea."
"It's a maze."
"This is really good."
"Give us a few minutes."
"It's going to happen."
"It's an advance."
"Yeah, it was good."
"I know your son."
"Can I do it again?"
"I feel different."
"Hence my call."
"I like water."
"So here we are."
"I prepared myself."
"You mean me?"
"I want to protect you."
"The gate is open."
"Good evening how are you?"
"What music do you like?"
"I taught him."
"We passed it."
"You got it all."
"Don't wake her up."
"You should let it go."
"What did you want to do?"
"He's our friend."
"They liked it."
"He's a clown."
"I just checked."
"The situation has changed."
"I have the cable."
"I wrote to him."
"We have an idea."
"I can do more."
"You have to be careful."
"Lowering the solar filter."
"Will you give it back to me?"
"No, I'm sincere."
"No one will believe you."
"We always do it."
"Aren't you thirsty?"
"Move your big toe."
"Are you the boxer?"
"We'll take care of that."
"Someone like you."
"Let him have fun."
"It's a detonator."
"I like trains."
"You must be thirsty."
"Not the right time?"
"I just wanted to talk."
"You are a friend."
"Well, I hope so."
"This is your gift."
"What should we do?"
"Tell me your story."
"These are my favorites."
"Was it really necessary?"
"He works with me."
"To make up for it."
"Where is the hammer?"
"Do you have any paper?"
"You can be."
"He's a big name."
"I believe you."
"I was at my wit's end."
"I am a doctor."
"Is the boss here?"
"She is doing well."
"I believed her."
"What do you want to hear?"
"You are really good."
"You are really talented."
"They saw it."
"It's a competition."
"You had to be there."
"Anything to declare?"
"That's the good news."
"Our work is done."
"Let him rest."
"She was telling the truth."
"This can't go on any longer."
"Let's go, buddy."
"He is our brother."
"Get yourself a job."
"Good night, you two."
"Who are you dating?"
"Pretty good, actually."
"How much for everything?"
"Oh, that's nice."
"It was a bet."
"Yes, I know you."
"Go ahead, do it."
"Yes, I believe you."
"Thank her for me."
"I will always love him."
"It seemed so real."
"I like your dress."
"Congratulations to both of you."
"Whatever you want, man."
"Is it safe?"
"I take my car."
"Because I know."
"I looked for her."
"Thank you for intervening."
"She is taking a bath."
"Is this your phone?"
"Are you on your period?"
"This is that door."
"Come have a drink."
"Don't you want to stay?"
"It was great, wasn't it?"
"Do you know the story?"
"You knew that, right?"
"You must follow me."
"We've seen it all."
"And mine too."
"It's done now."
"He had his reasons."
"Go back to your country."
"It's so simple."
"We'll do it again."
"He's an alcoholic."
"There are two of us then."
"Are you still here?"
"Should I be?"
"How could he?"
"I have two questions."
"I took some."
"Wait a minute."
"Be nice to her."
"It depends on her."
"The constants are stable."
"You can't what?"
"May God forgive you."
"They all say that."
"Not like the others."
"What is she going to do?"
"It's July."
"At the battle station."
"I'm going to make some."
"This is my task."
"It's frowned upon."
"I see it everywhere."
"Tell me a little."
"Tell me again."
"It's live."
"Everyone knows."
"Right on cue."
"Everything will be fine, Mom."
"Do you have a phone?"
"Do you want a massage?"
"Are you aware?"
"Whose house is it?"
"I'm taking a walk."
"What do you hope to find?"
"I like you."
"I'm coming to get him."
"No, thanks to you."
"Yes, very good, thank you."
"Because of him?"
"Are you with us?"
"I love this kitchen."
"But listen to me carefully."
"We have to decide."
"Your hair looks beautiful."
"Things got out of hand."
"Everyone sings."
"We're going to rest."
"Keep this for me."
"Give me the number."
"She's my roommate."
"Did I say that?"
"Are you sleeping or what?"
"That's right, man."
"It's a grave."
"Does she have someone?"
"This is my business."
"Who would want that?"
"As much as it takes."
"You two stay here."
"Did you hear it?"
"I will explain everything."
"It's a list."
"I worked a lot."
"You're lucky."
"We have a rhythm."
"It's the medication."
"Well, not exactly."
"This boy is right."
"Can you all hear me?"
"I will be very careful."
"We have a past."
"It's pitch black."
"As you wish, sir."
"It's a documentary."
"It's very relaxing."
"You chose it."
"Give us your news."
"We have to get started."
"Did he kiss you?"
"I managed."
"Bring them here."
"If you wish."
"Something better."
"It's his voice."
"We like each other."
"I live right there."
"Her name is Nancy."
"Last weekend."
"Let her go."
"Tell me your name again."
"Is this a coincidence?"
"Did he see you?"
"You don't have it?"
"How will I know?"
"I dreamed it."
"You have a chance."
"It's very powerful."
"Next time, then."
"It was very clear."
"How much do we have left?"
"You are very strong."
"Every time."
"You are the first."
"I'll tell you tomorrow."
"Look where we are."
"Yes, he is handsome."
"I'll see her tomorrow."
"For quite a while now."
"That you love me."
"Everyone has their reasons."
"Dinner is served."
"I got up."
"She was on the ground."
"Finally home."
"What do we tell him?"
"Everything is going perfectly well."
"Give me the Ring."
"Can you explain it?"
"My name is Allison."
"Are you on treatment?"
"Heaven on earth."
"My wife is going to give birth."
"You know women."
"I want to be sure."
"They're almost there."
"He's a kid."
"You abandoned us."
"I love flowers."
"It's not professional."
"It was a good try."
"See you tonight then."
"What can happen?"
"Sorry, it's me."
"Please accept my apologies."
"That's the theory."
"If you want, yes."
"We'll see each other tomorrow."
"She's his girlfriend."
"Where is your phone?"
"Yes, it's the same."
"Are you a girl?"
"What does this have to do with you?"
"How much did we make?"
"You are truly amazing."
"Honey, it's going to be okay."
"Could you do that?"
"I'll get them."
"He's going to be fine."
"Is this your cell?"
"You are one."
"I am the witness."
"She means well."
"This is his story."
"Do you really want to continue?"
"I want to watch it."
"That means a lot."
"You are monsters."
"I have to go."
"I am the manager."
"Mr. Prime Minister."
"Playtime is over."
"It's a comedy."
"He has everything planned."
"There was a crowd."
"You are like him."
"Have you seen each other?"
"He is an acquaintance."
"What is the frequency?"
"Could I talk to you?"
"Where are they?"
"Thousands dead."
"His mother died."
"Welcome to the world."
"You should meet him."
"In my opinion, yes."
"I'm not hiding."
"But I was there."
"Duty calls us."
"I take the subway."
"Good night, my love."
"It's very fast."
"We will do our best."
"Where is it hidden?"
"Do you like sports?"
"It might last."
"Do you have any information?"
"It's already decided."
"This is their territory."
"There are a few drops left."
"I'm at my maximum."
"Whose name?"
"I was talking to myself."
"Can you hold this?"
"It's water."
"That's the whole thing."
"Everything is going so fast."
"I hired you."
"It was very strong."
"What are the conditions?"
"I want my family."
"I did some."
"He is my family."
"I am always kind."
"I'm always kind."
"If I may say so."
"Yes, anything."
"Are these your parents?"
"It's a diamond."
"It's a clock."
"We will do it together."
"My God, forgive me."
"My God, forgive me."
"But you love him."
"Do you trust me?"
"I have medication."
"There are thousands of them."
"It's a swan."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"I have hair."
"You can count on it."
"Maybe tonight."
"She begged me."
"What do they call it?"
"You might think so."
"And who is she?"
"Oh, he's gorgeous."
"It's volunteer work."
"Only you can."
"They are with us."
"It's classified."
"It has to work."
"So, do you like it?"
"They have my daughter."
"So, what do we do?"
"You have to believe it."
"Do you want money?"
"This is your target."
"Do you want anything else?"
"It must be evacuated."
"He is doing well."
"Which one is yours?"
"Only life matters."
"Should I believe you?"
"Should I believe you?"
"It's a butterfly."
"Have you watched it?"
"How is our patient doing?"
"We had a good laugh."
"Yeah, he's fine."
"You're not possible."
"The children are here."
"It was really fun."
"What do you look like?"
"I'm going to the supermarket."
"You stay with me."
"You disobeyed me."
"This is a suggestion."
"My mother is waiting for me."
"You can thank me."
"Nobody listens to us."
"Something different."
"Do you have cash?"
"I'll send them to you."
"It's somewhere."
"Where is the house?"
"I think it's good."
"You have to focus."
"She's not here."
"He's having a fit."
"What do you want to see?"
"What do you want to see?"
"Thanks for sharing."
"Give me a second."
"I have a pencil."
"We discussed it."
"They are mercenaries."
"Come a little closer."
"You should like it."
"Oh, everything's fine."
"It was very cute."
"Thank you for understanding."
"How does it end?"
"I know the truth."
"It's so true."
"What do you want then?"
"I am the husband."
"I'm handling the situation."
"We have a story."
"What we do."
"Don't read this."
"I want your happiness."
"Now it's me."
"I'll take you there."
"Yes, I promise."
"What do you call it?"
"Through the front door."
"Okay, let's go."
"We are grateful to you."
"The roof is broken."
"Enough about the King."
"It amuses you, huh?"
"I was sitting there."
"Go home quickly."
"You are so beautiful."
"Any calls for me?"
"Am I early?"
"I will go with him."
"You didn't know that?"
"I have a prescription."
"Where is your captain?"
"Are you the owner?"
"Your rooms are ready."
"You're going to have fun."
"We are at my house."
"Did you eat well?"
"I have to."
"We are ahead of schedule."
"Do you want to swim?"
"I took it out."
"From top to bottom."
"Sorry about your friend."
"So what do you do?"
"She's a spy."
"I love gifts."
"Do you want to train?"
"I have the right to it."
"Thanks for the sandwich."
"I knew her."
"Isn't he handsome?"
"It was the opposite."
"Yes, it's over."
"Hi, what are you doing?"
"I hid it."
"Did I say it?"
"You should do this."
"Give it your all."
"And he will."
"You can take it."
"She found it."
"Let's calm down."
"Don't let me down."
"Are you in position?"
"Where were you yesterday?"
"Are you free tomorrow?"
"Are you leaving town?"
"These are your words."
"The FBI?"
"No, it's cute."
"It will be a piece of cake."
"Only two minutes left."
"I love your shoes."
"Yes, what do you want?"
"He helped us."
"We are in public."
"I'm so thirsty."
"Put it in there."
"You are a smart guy."
"We are heroes."
"They get along well."
"Thank you very much, goodbye."
"And what is your name?"
"Can we let it go?"
"Can you catch it?"
"Do you want my advice?"
"Do you like it here?"
"What should I answer?"
"I tried everything."
"I'm leaving the country."
"What do you think?"
"You are so pretty."
"We were good together."
"Come on, open your mouth."
"Are you working tonight?"
"What could be better?"
"I locked him up."
"Can I get it back?"
"Have a great summer."
"It's probably better."
"You play very well."
"What are you doing here?"
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"He has power."
"That was the end."
"Thank you, I'm fine."
"I wanted to see you again."
"You have time."
"It's the nerves."
"I want to hear them."
"No, it is."
"I inherited it."
"He's really cool."
"This is our target."
"How does it work?"
"Thank you, you are kind."
"That suits me too."
"Did you eat it?"
"Finally, we meet."
"Nothing is simple."
"What did your father do?"
"Who is responsible for this?"
"Ask my mother."
"Is that a yes?"
"And the other thing?"
"You guys were awesome."
"Where are they then?"
"Where are the parents?"
"I told you."
"I will call you back."
"I have to protect you."
"It's a raid."
"Do you have a key?"
"We need to call the cops."
"Do you take checks?"
"I'm going to calm down."
"I'll go look outside."
"How are we going to get in?"
"Promise me one thing."
"We can have them."
"It's so much fun."
"We're shooting a movie."
"I'll tell you."
"I rented it."
"Did you receive it?"
"He has a job."
"I'll call him back."
"What is their purpose?"
"You were with him."
"You have it now."
"It's your thing."
"He is a dentist."
"Are you comfortable?"
"The shop is closed."
"Where could she be?"
"He is very pleasant."
"If he wants to."
"It's a priority."
"Accident, if you will."
"You're welcome, you're welcome."
"I have the signal."
"Call the first witness."
"Do you like wine?"
"I am so relieved."
"It's quite tricky."
"Give me his number."
"It's just you."
"And in what way?"
"Do you want your money?"
"They come in here sometimes."
"Maybe not everything."
"That's pretty cool."
"Someone might come in."
"It's more fun."
"Thanks for the ice cream."
"I'll let you decide."
"He cheated on me."
"Give me that rifle."
"But not for that."
"He must know."
"The prosecution has finished."
"This is my land."
"You have three minutes."
"You should try it."
"She didn't say anything."
"What was he doing there?"
"She's really great."
"Yes, I understand that."
"So what are you doing?"
"What is he talking about?"
"Did you find any?"
"It's better to go home."
"Good luck, my love."
"What is it for?"
"Come see something."
"Get to the point."
"One of ours?"
"You see, my little one?"
"And all his possessions."
"We have a lot of fun."
"People love it."
"Not every night."
"Make room for me."
"My tomato burst."
"He'll get over it."
"I'm going to Harvard."
"She had her reasons."
"You owe him allegiance."
"Not enough time."
"Thank you, madam."
"Can you forgive me?"
"That's what it's for."
"They are at my house."
"I'll come back later."
"This gift is rare."
"It was pretty cool."
"Too few came."
"You're going to crash."
"He is on the move."
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"Go to your place."
"Do you have a wife?"
"Have a good time."
"I like coffee."
"Both are good."
"So, have you decided?"
"I have a delivery."
"Which one do you start with?"
"No one will know anything."
"Next right."
"Do you want breakfast?"
"This place is huge."
"Look at all these people."
"You may think so."
"The head came out."
"Okay, that's fine with me."
"What he wants."
"It's an asset."
"Your car is waiting for you."
"If I had it?"
"She's getting married tomorrow."
"I'm going to meet him."
"How do you know that?"
"She must have forgotten."
"Sure, mate."
"I take the train."
"And what do I say?"
"Don't you feel it?"
"Your name, little lady?"
"We have the proof."
"He has an attack."
"He told me."
"Can I interview you?"
"Uh, you know what?"
"May I be so bold?"
"Is your project still on?"
"I am a father."
"He had work."
"I love this man."
"We're at the top."
"You were awesome."
"I am your brother."
"Not here, not now."
"Bend down a little."
"Is that all, sir?"
"I don't answer."
"You think of everything."
"Are you one?"
"Do you know how to drive this?"
"Nor ever in advance."
"Give him something."
"I withdraw the question."
"Where is this man?"
"They were murdered."
"Are you satisfied with this?"
"He had one."
"His name is Connor."
"It's autumn."
"Including our guy?"
"I am a romantic."
"It's a quick one."
"How do you find it?"
"Yeah, what's up?"
"I work like this."
"You're going strong."
"Let me sort this out."
"Thank you for seeing me."
"Let me explain."
"I just wanted to try."
"Where is he now?"
"How it's pronounced."
"Peanut butter."
"We're going to separate."
"You were very good."
"How are you, Tony?"
"It's good here."
"Let him go."
"The door was locked."
"When are we doing this?"
"Lunch time."
"It's up to you to find out."
"Where does this door lead?"
"We still are."
"Your wife is waiting for you."
"I'm so excited."
"Who invited you?"
"It's an intervention."
"I'm undercover."
"And who is he?"
"I have some information."
"It's going to be day."
"Use your imagination."
"Do you play poker?"
"How do I know that?"
"What are their names?"
"How is your knee?"
"Where are you taking us?"
"What did he say?"
"I thought so."
"He is a saint."
"Will you kiss me?"
"She is in a meeting."
"Hi, where are you?"
"I guessed it."
"We're going to camp here."
"He was your friend."
"Where is the picture?"
"Are you going to play it?"
"Can we eat it?"
"It's really extraordinary."
"You don't know how to drive?"
"Can you fix this?"
"Do you want your share?"
"Give me your jacket."
"I am a fighter."
"I wouldn't want to."
"Where is the guard?"
"Is that Brett?"
"We have to focus."
"Can you sign this?"
"Do you have the address?"
"This is my watch."
"I could go there."
"Duty above all."
"She is in Paris."
"We will find a solution."
"I would do the same."
"She did nothing."
"Excuse us for a moment."
"My sword is yours."
"And you are."
"You have to know that."
"It's lighter."
"This is my jacket."
"Where are the papers?"
"What is the date?"
"I was getting some fresh air."
"Day by day."
"Let's start from the beginning."
"You are a saint."
"We have proof."
"Who authorized it?"
"Yes, she is good."
"Why do you have this?"
"Is Vincent Vega here?"
"I'm your friend."
"And he loves you."
"You'll see that."
"I like this word."
"Let me be the judge."
"Hey, it's going to be okay."
"I was sixteen years old."
"See you another time."
"Is this really him?"
"I closed it."
"Is this your signature?"
"Where is yours?"
"I love this country."
"Do you want to meet him?"
"This is that woman."
"Of course, I can."
"Why do you ask?"
"How do you explain that?"
"Pass me one."
"Including our dreams."
"I'm writing a novel."
"Find another one."
"Spread the word."
"I'll make a note of that."
"No, not at all."
"She stays with us."
"You are Vincent."
"You should stay here."
"They are amateurs."
"Where is the bar?"
"Yeah, that's better."
"So where is it?"
"Can you see that?"
"So why do it?"
"What are you working on?"
"He tells me everything."
"I betrayed you."
"He turned around."
"I know that."
"That would have surprised me."
"It feels like a dream."
"I'll take the train."
"The one you want."
"This is our market."
"I'll tell you when."
"Training is over."
"Maybe tonight."
"What do I feel?"
"This is the man."
"They saw everything."
"Neither women nor children."
"He does his job."
"I want my freedom."
"Yes, they are."
"You have school tomorrow."
"I got it back."
"Yes, I love it."
"I'm keeping watch."
"Do you want to tell me?"
"Is he your lover?"
"They are police officers."
"I need to calm down."
"Is this the end?"
"Fingerprint identification, please."
"They like me."
"He is a handsome man."
"He was held back."
"Take me there."
"No one should enter."
"I work at night."
"You're going to have to leave."
"How many were there?"
"Do you have a condom?"
"She knows my name."
"What about a Big Mac?"
"How do they know?"
"Have we identified him?"
"Do you want a baby?"
"When you grow up."
"You will stay here."
"Yes, but still."
"I would be grateful."
"Where is the third one?"
"By making me cum?"
"That was me."
"She's your cousin."
"Have you been married?"
"She is coming towards us."
"Do you have any cigarettes?"
"I will report it."
"May I ask a question?"
"I thought you were gone."
"It's me, man."
"I'm the good guy."
"The return journey."
"Do you have any leads?"
"You have to believe it."
"Thanks for the water."
"Exactly the same thing."
"Thank you, Officer."
"Go see your father."
"What are you coming for?"
"You are absolutely right."
"You must follow us."
"I have to think about it."
"Yes, I swear."
"Both of you be careful."
"You can handle this."
"I have given enough."
"Among many others."
"Whose honor?"
"The witness may answer."
"I parked."
"It's his favorite."
"How does he know that?"
"Goodbye, Grandpa."
"Look at this place."
"Dances with Wolves."
"It was an idea."
"How do we know?"
"From when?"
"It's a castle."
"He takes care of it."
"I opened it."
"Do I believe it?"
"And I will be there."
"Tomorrow at dawn."
"She found me."
"Do you have a verdict?"
"I'm getting out of here."
"You don't know anything about it."
"One or two weeks."
"Is he okay?"
"All over the world."
"Which hospital is this?"
"How dare she?"
"I like it here."
"I finally meet you."
"Are you the husband?"
"In the name of God."
"You have a good heart."
"They are all here."
"Just be yourself."
"We have the advantage."
"Like this, my chick?"
"I do it to myself."
"I want to be honest."
"But it's beautiful."
"We need to get organized."
"With ice?"
"It's a blast."
"Who bought it?"
"Keep a cool head."
"What do you gain from it?"
"Not after all that."
"He will tell you."
"He married her."
"This is very encouraging."
"I love this one."
"You're all red."
"Do you have a license?"
"I find that unfair."
"What are they doing there?"
"I will keep you informed."
"It's a spell."
"He is in high school."
"I should apologize."
"Yes, we are friends."
"I accept the offer."
"No, I'm hungry."
"I love this book."
"Who are the parents?"
"It's his heart."
"Yes, I know you."
"And all this why?"
"As you know."
"The sky is clear."
"You never go out."
"It's quite serious."
"Go ahead, ask him."
"You will pay for it."
"Things like that."
"I'll call him."
"What kind of ideas?"
"They released him."
"They came in large numbers."
"My name is Billy."
"I'll take the couch."
"You must forgive me."
"Were you able to sleep?"
"What is the signal?"
"Go see your daughter."
"This is my priority."
"You are so cute."
"You are so cute."
"Specialty of the house."
"I still think so."
"No one survived."
"You should take it."
"My name is Angel."
"The CIA?"
"He is on the ground."
"He's talking about me."
"Tell them the truth."
"It was summer."
"What do you want to prove?"
"I am a legend."
"Thanks for checking."
"That's super nice."
"How are you boys?"
"They will know what to do."
"That's saying a lot."
"I know that feeling."
"Dad, what are you doing?"
"And take him where?"
"She's probably right."
"What could be more normal?"
"We have a child."
"We succeeded together."
"Find out who it is."
"Did you wait long?"
"You know the monsters."
"Is there a difference?"
"This is my costume."
"I will set you free."
"And is it serious?"
"Is there a place left?"
"Give me the letter."
"The situation is beyond our control."
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Everything's fine, son."
"I'm doing the dishes."
"I will have the money."
"I will wait for your call."
"Put your hand here."
"She was."
"So where are they?"
"What are you implying?"
"Can I get rid of you?"
"But they are there."
"Very well, good night."
"What is my name?"
"You know the rules."
"What do you believe in?"
"What do you believe?"
"He's your fiancé."
"You could do it."
"It's a network."
"It was so easy."
"Are you in Paris?"
"I'll hold it."
"Why do this?"
"I do my best."
"Everyone is talking."
"Welcome to my world."
"There is something else."
"I will answer you."
"We will be heroes."
"We all loved him."
"Where are the tapes?"
"Can we take him?"
"What should you do?"
"Are you coming or not?"
"Give yourself time."
"I'm on my own."
"I'm looking for a book."
"Where do we put it?"
"She must know."
"I will always protect you."
"I am a messenger."
"What is he saying?"
"Of course, my darling."
"The target moves."
"Yes, you are right."
"You need to relax."
"We can hear you."
"You'll know tomorrow."
"A masterpiece."
"Duty calls."
"They don't work."
"Are you down there?"
"Yes, it's fantastic."
"Will you tell him why?"
"I was looking for work."
"Did he talk about it?"
"On one condition."
"Thanks anyway."
"They will treat you."
"Don't answer me."
"Are you going that way?"
"You like that, don't you?"
"Count to three."
"This one is good."
"Well, he was."
"Shall we have lunch together tomorrow?"
"Let me see you."
"It's a set."
"A hunting accident."
"This is your patient."
"He's a snitch."
"I will abstain."
"I wrote it."
"Say it with me."
"Say it with me."
"What's up, boss?"
"Something has moved."
"Where are his things?"
"You are a witch."
"Glad to hear it."
"My name is Carrie."
"Go get a doctor."
"She was very kind."
"Yes, what else?"
"It would be a miracle."
"Mom, are you there?"
"I'll let you think about it."
"We should listen to him."
"The light is on."
"Yes, that was it."
"You set me free."
"Before I was a knight."
"One man, two women."
"I would have seen it."
"I like this one."
"It has its advantages."
"He worked for us."
"I want my father."
"I love being here."
"I have to sort this out."
"Red leather, yellow leather."
"If I know what?"
"Yeah, yeah, sure."
"Go back to your mother."
"You are a pro."
"I would like your opinion."
"Let me introduce you to Raquel."
"All of this is true."
"Wait, wait a minute."
"I have to warn them."
"Did you call her?"
"We abandoned them."
"Will you be able to remain loyal?"
"You have red."
"Can we do it again?"
"You have two choices."
"What did it look like?"
"I'll take your place."
"I'm here, right?"
"Your eyelids are heavy."
"But this was different."
"It's time."
"The orders have changed."
"He's coming towards you."
"You are very perceptive."
"He is four years old."
"There you are right."
"Do they treat you well?"
"It was fast."
"You can say no."
"That's my answer."
"I'll take this side."
"Go to the police."
"He is in order."
"It's his head."
"Do you look like a chick?"
"It will make me happy."
"What are you?"
"Thanks for the whiskey."
"You can call me."
"We've got everything planned."
"Did you listen to me?"
"Come see for yourself."
"I stopped."
"So where have you been?"
"He marks his territory."
"Thanks for the cigarette."
"I would like to meet them."
"And not the least."
"It was hers."
"Any more good news?"
"Where are you hiding?"
"Are you thinking of giving up?"
"Thank you for your honesty."
"I am in front of you."
"Carrie, it's Quinn."
"Three or four years."
"Good luck, girls."
"So it was you."
"This is more important."
"You, that's all."
"Sorry about last night."
"It will never end."
"Take it easy."
"Where is the money?"
"She is very small."
"The doors are open."
"Where are you going?"
"Without saying goodbye?"
"I'll leave first."
"Give me the check."
"What, in the belly?"
"It must be protected."
"That's him, man."
"You must stay calm."
"Come with me then."
"I left it."
"I just got out."
"Do you want a drink?"
"And the other night?"
"Warn everyone."
"It's going great."
"I believed in you."
"We are all human."
"We talked a lot."
"Are you coming to see me?"
"He was transferred."
"This is evolution."
"That's great, Dad."
"Take him to the station."
"He loves children."
"That was my name."
"Do you recognize this woman?"
"Glad to be here."
"That's better."
"The cops came."
"I picked it up."
"Make the right choice."
"Are you aware of this?"
"Nobody notices."
"Where have you been?"
"Where have you been?"
"What kind of surprise?"
"I ate some."
"But we have to go."
"Are you really serious?"
"This is an estimate."
"Do you have cash?"
"The pleasure is shared."
"Everything's fine, right?"
"Maybe I'll drop by."
"Do you want sugar?"
"You are my savior."
"What if I kept it?"
"I can do without it."
"Is that your excuse?"
"Give me my phone."
"I like blue."
"She's my neighbor."
"Is she okay?"
"You can go out now."
"You can go out now."
"I change my vote."
"You don't know him."
"See you next time."
"The facts are there."
"He was great."
"You can rest assured."
"Am I pronouncing it correctly?"
"He still goes there."
"We saw that."
"This is my dinner."
"I have an apartment."
"A clean cup."
"I strum the bass."
"He is eight years old."
"Follow me, guys."
"And one, two, three."
"We will stay in touch."
"Nothing is easy."
"And there he is."
"Have a nice stay."
"What is at stake?"
"I have a job."
"I will pay you."
"Nothing here either."
"What's wrong with you?"
"I see one."
"I'm going to join him."
"I would like a coffee."
"I am the Count."
"The doctor is waiting for you."
"How are you over there?"
"You must be cold."
"Give me the phone."
"Are you still up?"
"There is a scale."
"Will you show me around?"
"Who was it for?"
"Let's not think about it."
"No, it's there."
"I am a cat."
"It's a sport."
"We worked together."
"I don't have to."
"He doesn't answer anymore."
"I'll go get her."
"Is he mine?"
"A picture of you."
"Do you see this car?"
"You'll find out."
"What is their story?"
"Who helped you?"
"But it's nice."
"No, don't say anything."
"Let me do this."
"Thank you for saying that."
"Nice of you."
"What if it works?"
"Think about your family."
"Mom, what is it?"
"But you are here."
"And we will see them."
"Where is the package?"
"Just for you."
"She is really nice."
"She won't want to."
"The car is in front."
"Where is he then?"
"Are you comfortable?"
"Nothing matters anymore."
"That's understandable, right?"
"I have a buyer."
"Can I play with it?"
"Do you read the newspapers?"
"It's a surprise."
"It's so sexy."
"They are the best."
"You must be Elena."
"No, I swear."
"What am I looking for?"
"The discussion is over."
"What could I say?"
"How do we turn this off?"
"Maybe, maybe."
"One, two, one, two."
"It's by invitation."
"Do you know this guy?"
"You have a client."
"Put the handcuffs on him."
"Go to bed now."
"Is this the register?"
"Who wants some champagne?"
"How does she do that?"
"Well, so to speak."
"Come work for me."
"When I say it."
"Do you want children?"
"Do you want a candy?"
"You are doing very well."
"It's a commitment."
"You are Micky Ward."
"She is seven years old."
"They said no."
"No new messages."
"They are my friends."
"When do you want to leave?"
"Teach me to see."
"I arrived yesterday."
"I freed him."
"You have taste."
"I bought this."
"If you want."
"Would you like to try?"
"You don't recognize me?"
"You should go to bed."
"We are the last."
"So it's you."
"I want to believe you."
"It was necessary."
"I should be here."
"Thank you for staying."
"Down to the bone."
"Look at all this."
"Did you know?"
"He contacted me."
"Shall we play guessing games?"
"You can take it back."
"He is three years old."
"A friend of yours?"
"Do you have a pen?"
"Can't you knock?"
"I listened to you."
"My life belongs to me."
"You will wait here."
"Don't call them."
"Do you have an appointment?"
"We can do anything."
"Tell me your secret."
"Phil, are you there?"
"You can speak well."
"She knows how to do it."
"We were kids."
"Or nothing at all."
"I pulled over."
"This will be our stop."
"Where is the victim?"
"It was pitch black."
"Where is it at?"
"It's a revolution."
"It's morphine."
"It's another one."
"Do you like magic?"
"Don't start, Mom."
"No, I'm going to walk."
"Fine, as you wish."
"Give him a minute."
"Hey, how are you?"
"You have to control yourself."
"Can I go swimming?"
"No, but it will come."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"You think you know everything."
"I had done it."
"He admitted it."
"We should do it again."
"It always ends the same."
"That's the answer."
"What to say to people?"
"No fights here."
"She is very busy."
"Is your husband here?"
"You are a star."
"Let's go to my office."
"What do you want?"
"Let me take it."
"I say no."
"Wait, what are you doing?"
"Wait, what are you doing?"
"It's so hot."
"I know, so what?"
"Thank you for this clarification."
"More than an hour."
"It's a club."
"I will pay you well."
"Look inside."
"How is your health?"
"Someone rang."
"Grands-Pas will protect them."
"Are you watching TV?"
"Does he work for you?"
"A little cognac?"
"It's so small."

"You too, by the way."
"What would you do?"
"I had a family."
"Let me serve you."
"This guy is good."
"I have my job."
"Let's go talk downstairs."
"This is the end of the line."

"It was a decoy."
"Very close to here."
"Did you give it to him?"
"Yes, they are fine."
"Where did you go?"
"I keep my distance."
"I want to be useful."
"Bring him here."
"It seems fine to me."
"Here is a pretty thing."
"But listen to me carefully."
"He was very ill."
"Welcome to Las Vegas."
"I put it there."
"No, you have to go."
"You will find me."
"The baby's father."
"It's a gun."
"Thanks for the car."
"You are so beautiful."
"Did I ring you?"
"Okay, honey."
"A man without honor."
"They looked for him."
"Don't you remember?"
"But he is nice."
"It's so dark."
"Do you have any ideas?"
"Believe it or not."
"I trust them."

"We will come and get you."
"I want a coffee."
"She's not joking."
"What are you doing to him?"
"Just a little longer."
"Do I love him?"
"He engineered the whole thing."
"It's a tic."
"Have you had any?"
"Open his mouth."
"We had to do it."
"But you knew that."
"He did it again."
"How do you know me?"

"This is understandable."
"This is my price."
"I see the Shire."
"It's a tribute."
"We are a team."
"Did you look at yourself?"
"He knows me well."
"Not for the money."
"Pass me the salt."
"It was a message."
"What are you doing then?"
"It will bring you luck."
"He has one."
"She is my wife."
"You can be proud."
"I confessed everything."
"You don't dance?"
"This can be remedied."
"Yes, it happened."
"I already know her."
"The King's Tree."

"Have you been training?"
"Very good, actually."
"Are you defending him?"
"Thank you, it was great."
"He loved you very much."
"Your car is ready."
"What's on the menu?"
"Any messages for me?"
"They shouldn't."
"Very good, it works."
"Are these your friends?"
"I know, old man."
"This is good news."
"You know that I do."
"It's our business."
"What were their names?"
"That's it, that's it."
"I'll take care of him."
"Courage for our friends."
"Now let's go."
"Stay in the vehicle."
"I know my wife."
"Have a nice day, guys."
"Like the other day."
"I got the part."
"No, he's here."
"Did you bury him?"
"And his name is?"
"I'll drink to that."
"You're up early."
"What do you do with it?"
"Who told you?"
"In a little while."
"You have one week."
"And the last time?"
"Where are you taking me?"
"I'm going back tomorrow."
"They like you."
"I see clearly."
"It will relax you."
"This is their home."
"He makes us walk."
"You tell me."
"But I tried."
"You have the power."
"Do you go there often?"
"That was the job."
"He comes to see me."
"It was the minimum."
"Yes, yes, go ahead."
"Sorry, I have to answer."
"I love my mother."
"Can I talk now?"
"I'll buy it for you."
"Who do you work with?"
"They will find me."
"They are all different."
"It's cooler."
"Still in the hospital."
"Can we open it?"
"What is it, what?"
"How did you come?"
"Look in your pocket."
"Give me the picture."
"This is the system."
"A little bit more."
"How are you this morning?"
"Give me the wheel."
"The signal is clear."
"He is a mercenary."
"What kind of dreams?"
"Where are you going?"
"After so many years?"
"He is very protective."
"They will be here soon."
"My name is Tatiana."
"We tell the truth."
"Where can we go?"
"I can imagine very well."
"Yeah, what is it?"
"I do it often."
"What is his name?"
"You are someone."
"Does that remind you of anything?"
"Quick and painless."
"Do you hear voices?"
"Someone must know."
"He is now."
"It's okay, it's okay."
"How is it again?"
"Go take a bath."
"We have rules."
"I can find her again."
"They trust you."
"Sorry about your brother."
"Go home immediately."
"Let me handle this."
"And he succeeded."
"I know your secret."
"Go to the kitchen."
"We must hold on."
"Here she comes."
"They are humans."
"Do you want candy?"
"You're going to wake her up."
"No trace of them."
"He was so happy."
"Did you have fun?"
"He is really handsome."
"We'll resume later."
"Should I call someone?"
"I like your costume."
"You'll have to wait."
"Have you waited long?"
"He loves me very much."
"Are you going with me?"
"Go ahead, talk to him."
"None came."
"He has the money."
"Yes, you have it."
"Somewhere around here."
"She was a friend."
"I'm looking for a job."
"It's so quiet."
"Listen to me very carefully."
"Can you see it?"
"But I can try."
"Are you going to continue for long?"
"Who ordered this?"
"What would people say?"
"Do you live around here?"
"Is it leather?"
"Everyone smiles."
"You can get up."
"Who are you with?"
"We are soldiers."
"It must be there."
"Where does the money go?"
"But everything changed."
"That's a good summary."
"Back to reality."
"You need to calm down."
"Give me the lamp."
"Are you here already?"
"Are you absolutely sure?"
"I'll leave them to you."
"It seems logical to me."
"It's marked here."
"Thanks for noticing."
"Do you want some cheese?"
"This is our family."
"Do you have a moment?"
"You will know what to do."
"Your wife is here."
"I'll let you choose."
"No, don't do that."
"Here, keep the change."
"Yes, I would love that."
"It creates connections."
"Do you feel different?"
"It suits me perfectly."
"I am the same."
"I prefer to abstain."
"Go watch TV."
"Where were we?"
"I supported you."
"Where is the ammunition?"
"Don't act like a girl."
"Let's give him a chance."
"See you on Friday."
"You have a job."
"It's a coffin."
"Glad to see you."
"You speak without knowing."
"Wake up, my darling."
"It's for now."
"Wait until you see her."
"Between you and me?"

"I think it's wonderful."
"I woke him up."
"It's pretty clear."
"He is waving to us."
"When can you leave?"
"I'm going to change it."
"If you're interested."
"We invented it."
"My name is Rose."
"Do you have his address?"
"He is in conference."
"But you can't."
"I will have heard everything."
"When was that again?"
"Make less noise."
"What was he working on?"
"You are really kind."
"Do you have any information?"
"No one is sure."
"It was very romantic."

"She's the queen."
"The ventilation duct."
"She was my wife."
"Who was with him?"
"Are you really interested?"
"He's up to something."
"Good afternoon, sir."
"Can you pass it to me?"

"Yes, I have it."
"We all have to go."
"I'm looking for a job."
"What is it now?"
"And for what reason?"
"Do you want a spanking?"
"See an old friend."
"I thought I was."
"It doesn't exist anymore."
"Neither do the others."
"I can hear you breathing."
"That's it, keep going."
"He wanted to protect me."
"It's going to be quick."
"Are you going to eat it?"
"Which one is cooking?"
"What to do with him?"
"That's a lot."
"I'm done."
"It makes me hungry."
"Thank you for joining us."
"Where are the doctors?"
"But what do you want?"

"I know everything about you."
"This is what I propose."
"It was a pleasure."
"What are these things?"
"You are very lucky."
"I'm right behind you."
"They are not ready."
"Where can I find it?"
"I saw someone."
"Listen, I have to go."
"I'm going to need it."
"What happened to you?"
"I have to go back."

"She changed her mind."
"You have to go."
"They are no longer there."
"Do you know who that was?"
"And I found this."
"Very nice to meet you."
"Just what you need."
"She already did it."
"How do you know my name?"
"How do you know my name?"
"I thought of everything."
"I can explain everything to you."
"I can explain everything to you."
"Do you know where they are?"
"I'll take care of him."
"Did we understand each other?"
"Do you want to know the truth?"
"I didn't see."
"I asked a question."
"I've already thought about it."
"Is it true or not?"
"Where did you get it?"
"But things have changed."
"Isn't that enough?"
"Where did you find them?"
"Where did you find them?"
"I've always said it."
"You are doing a good job."
"No, I don't want to."
"It's a simple question."
"Yes, I think so."
"Did he say anything else?"
"Let's get this straight."
"I slept with him."
"It's within my capabilities."
"How did you do that?"
"I need money."
"Isn't she beautiful?"
"Breakfast is ready."
"Can anyone confirm this?"
"You look like it."
"Thank you for calling me."
"I was told about it."
"Let's get out of here."
"She's just a friend."
"I'm just looking around."
"We'll find something."
"She needs us."
"Can I go home?"
"He had a stroke."
"Can I get you something?"
"Yes, I have one."
"Yes, I have one."
"Can I have your attention?"
"Your wish is my command."
"Your wish is my command."
"It got me thinking."
"Papers, please."
"What year is it?"
"I have everything under control."
"Is it yes or no?"
"I am grateful to you."
"I am grateful to you."
"Do you want to make love?"
"My name is Oliver Queen."
"Are we in agreement?"
"We have to go."
"I saw it too."
"Where did you get that from?"
"Where did you get that from?"
"What is this?"
"It was in the newspapers."
"There is a chance."
"I know where to find him."
"Come in, please."
"How much will it cost me?"
"Would you like to leave a message?"
"You have the green light."
"I retired."
"I want to come with you."
"This is an interesting theory."
"How did you get here?"
"How did you get here?"
"It's my father's."
"I did my job."
"She is at home."
"Don't go too far."
"Who is the lucky one?"
"You haven't forgotten anything?"
"Have you forgotten anything?"
"Dad, please."
"What did he answer?"
"I came to see you."
"I came to see you."
"Something like that."
"Have you changed your mind?"
"Have we met before?"
"I have other plans."
"This is what happens."
"I'll get a towel."
"Can I sit here?"
"What should I have done?"
"What should I have done?"
"Can I say something?"
"I saw the pictures."
"I still have work to do."
"It's my mother's."
"She needs rest."
"Here, this is for you."
"Is that your last word?"
"Do you remember that?"
"Do you remember that?"
"I need one."
"How did you get this?"
"You should come with us."
"Look who's back."
"What happened next?"
"She is everything to me."
"No need to tell me."
"How was your day?"
"Will you be here for a long time?"
"It's all in the wrist."
"Who told you about it?"
"You have no proof."
"We are the police."
"Doesn't that bother you?"
"I completely agree."
"Face it."
"I'm good at it."
"There was someone."
"Yes, I saw that."
"You can't know."
"I slept with her."
"That's a good sign, right?"
"I'm family."
"No, not so much."
"It may take time."
"I want to dance."
"It's a good day."
"Do what you can."
"I'll show you around."
"And how do you know that?"
"And how do you know that?"
"Please, Mom."
"No, I won't go."
"Now it's your turn."
"There is a solution."
"Don't just stand there."
"I'm going to the airport."
"Yes, there are."
"You have visitors."
"I have nothing else."
"I have to eat."
"I've thought about it carefully."
"Do you feel capable of it?"
"What is this about?"
"Can I take a look?"
"I have a good idea."
"What a pleasure to see you."
"That is very true."
"You're going to need it."
"What I said."
"I'll show you around."
"This is a big deal."
"I'll join you later."
"Who did it?"
"I owe you one."
"I told you everything."
"I will do my best."
"It's a delicate situation."
"So what are you doing here?"
"So what are you doing here?"
"That would make me very happy."
"Nobody saw me."
"I'm going to call the cops."
"I'll join you later."
"How did it get there?"
"Because I know it."
"I don't like him."
"Don't tell me that."
"At least, I hope so."
"I have a good one."
"That's a good reason."
"Can I?"
"I'll get my things."
"Do you want another one?"
"Since when have you known?"
"What does that mean?"
"It's an old story."
"I owe you my life."
"What did you do to him?"
"You're a good guy."
"You're a good guy."
"That's my opinion."
"Didn't you see?"
"What are we talking about?"
"You'll need this."
"You know how it works."
"She doesn't know."
"She doesn't know anything about it."
"She wouldn't do that."
"Where did you put it?"
"I wanted to give this to you."
"I have a good feeling."
"I am a married man."
"No, not yet."
"What do you want to tell me?"
"What are you doing tonight?"
"I was going to ask you that."
"I was going to ask you that."
"There is an explanation."
"I am all yours."
"I would like to say something."
"How did you meet?"
"How could I forget?"
"And I can prove it."
"There is a woman."
"I've done my time."
"I saw the movie."
"Now it's my turn."
"I am not him."
"Can I buy you a coffee?"
"I work for the government."
"That's what we're here for."
"You promised me."
"You don't think so."
"He made his choice."
"Nice to see you too."
"I'm leaving."
"We are here for you."
"I don't recognize him."
"Tell me where you are."
"I'm a big fan."
"How did they find us?"
"Well, that's true."
"I'll let you know."
"Three months ago."
"It's good for us."
"This is our only lead."
"One day or another."
"I had to come."
"In a way, yes."
"No, no, I'm fine."
"We start from the beginning."
"It was the only solution."
"You're doing a good job."
"And that's the truth."
"It's politics."
"Did you have a good trip?"
"If you agree."
"This is our best chance."
"Can you do something?"
"Can I borrow it?"
"No, you shouldn't."
"Is it going to be long?"
"We will keep you informed."
"How did you find it?"
"People don't change."
"How will it go?"
"I just have a few questions."
"A little further to the right."
"I told you no."
"Excuse me for a second?"
"I thought you knew."
"For what it's worth."
"I like this one."
"Is this your mother again?"
"I gave you everything."
"Who is this guy?"
"He was a good boy."
"Some things never change."
"What did you think?"
"Can't you hear me?"
"I have to go to the office."
"I want to see my lawyer."
"What are you going to tell him?"
"What are you going to tell him?"
"Where does this come from?"
"I kept my promise."
"It's on my way."
"Don't you want to come?"
"You are all the same."
"But that's life."
"I just saw her."
"I apologize."
"Do you have any change?"
"Yes, I can do it."
"I saw the news."
"Maybe I will."
"I'll see you tonight."
"Give me another chance."
"I want to see my father."
"See you at the office."
"Mind your own business."
"Do you want to come with me?"
"May I ask you why?"
"This is the best part."
"No, I don't want any."
"I'll do it later."
"I received your message."
"I've had enough."
"I'll be back in a moment."
"What are we going to do now?"
"Did I say that?"
"Who is behind all this?"
"What is it?"
"What's up?"
"I'm very happy here."
"Do you want to leave?"
"I have to hang up."
"I let you down."
"Can you keep a secret?"
"Why did you do that?"
"Why did you do that?"
"I'll take you there."
"Who found the body?"
"She wasn't there."
"I think so."
"Welcome to my humble abode."
"Do you trust me?"
"You look happy."
"Don't you remember?"
"She's all yours."
"I saw him yesterday."
"There are three of them."
"No need to apologize."
"Everyone wins."
"You are the expert."
"What can you tell us?"
"Keep an eye on him."
"See you later."
"I made a list."
"I don't know, Dad."
"Have you heard about it?"
"I'll go now."
"We have to turn around."
"Because I want to."
"What year is it?"
"A lot has changed."
"As I said."
"Do you want to go home?"
"No, that won't work."
"What's going on here?"
"What's going on here?"
"What's your name again?"
"We made a deal."
"Are you with someone?"
"I'm ready to go."
"I'll call you back later."
"Is that your real name?"
"I am in good health."
"That's life."
"Doesn't that remind you of anything?"
"There is some of that."
"We have a lot to do."
"Not for everyone."
"Do you know where we are?"
"I'll talk to him about it."
"I can't now."
"You don't know anything about it."
"Do you feel better now?"
"It was my father's."
"You should have told me."
"Haven't you noticed?"
"It will never happen again."
"So that's how it is?"
"There's nothing we can do about it."
"I'll buy you a drink."
"Because I say so."
"You've done enough."
"I just got it."
"They are human beings."
"Did you find anything?"
"There was a girl."
"It was more than that."
"I made a choice."
"Like most people."
"It's just a dream."
"I'm doing well."
"I always have."
"We'll talk later."
"We'll talk to you later."
"I just wanted to thank you."
"I just wanted to thank you."
"Please continue."
"Please continue."
"Has this ever happened to you?"
"Everyone thinks so."
"You two, come with me."
"What are you still doing here?"
"What are you still doing here?"
"A promise is a promise."
"Take good care of yourself."
"Where did you get that?"
"Did you tell him?"
"You heard me correctly."
"I'll fix that for you."
"What do you need?"
"This is my grandmother."
"This is the pure truth."
"How do you know all this?"
"What did you tell him?"
"To what do I owe the honor?"
"Who does she think she is?"
"Nice to see you."
"Nice to see you."
"You are my best friend."
"She's a good girl."
"Please, Dad."
"Oh, yes, that's true."
"The law is the law."
"I hope you like it."
"She needs you."
"I'll be back in five minutes."
"He told the truth."
"I'm inviting you to dinner."
"No, he can't."
"Put yourself in his shoes."
"Nice to see you again."
"You will be safe there."
"I'll get you some."
"We'll take care of you."
"Come forward, please."
"Come on, please."
"Yes, I will do it."
"We are home."
"I had a revelation."
"I am here for you."
"How can we do this?"
"What did they do to him?"
"What did you just say?"
"Have you done your homework?"
"You're never here."
"It looks like it."
"Yes, that's exactly it."
"I have one too."
"What happened to him?"
"You don't believe it?"
"You are a big boy."
"Whatever the cost."
"I don't remember."
"Who did this to you?"
"Maybe we'll see each other again."
"Where is she?"
"Did she tell you about it?"
"Have you thought about that?"
"Give me one good reason."
"See you at dinner."
"I didn't understand."
"They are good people."
"You have to see this."
"You can't come."
"No, you don't know."
"I learned my lesson."
"I have known him for a long time."
"You'll never make it."
"Have you ever done this?"
"It's for the house."
"Do you know who this is?"
"It makes sense."
"How is everyone doing?"
"Three weeks ago."
"And you, how are you?"
"It's a simple question."
"This is what we do."
"I forgot my glasses."
"I was thinking of something else."
"Let's take a look."
"Let's take a look."
"I would like you to come."
"You have to tell me."
"Because I know you."
"Can I take a picture?"
"I wanted to be with you."
"Wait, please."
"I did it."
"Everyone loves you."
"She hasn't changed."
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
"You are like your father."
"In the middle of nowhere."
"Now it's too late."
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
"This is my little girl."
"And me, in all this?"
"Maybe it's me."
"Only we remain."
"Do you know where she is?"
"It's the weekend."
"Nice to meet you."
"Where did they take him?"
"Not another step."
"You owe me that."
"I just wanted to apologize."
"So how are you feeling?"
"A matter of perspective."
"Nothing makes sense."
"Someone wants to talk to you."
"He knows who I am."
"A man and a woman."
"How long have you known?"
"This is unprecedented."
"I bought this for you."
"What did you call me?"
"I'm on to something."
"He was a good guy."
"So who did it?"
"I went home."
"I've never seen her."
"It's a lot of work."
"I only have you."
"Where are you going like this?"
"Don't ask me that."
"Well, you know what?"
"You don't believe it?"
"Don't let me down."
"I am well aware of that."
"How do you know about this?"
"It was him or me."
"Look who I found."
"I saw things."
"Do you really want to know?"
"You won't do that."
"Stay, please."
"What did I tell you?"
"You don't know them."
"I tell you yes."
"Good luck tonight."
"It wasn't a question."
"I'm waiting for the right moment."
"And you, how are you?"
"I like you too."
"I'll come with you."
"I was in the hospital."
"We have to go now."
"To what do I owe this pleasure?"
"I love you, sweetie."
"I need to work."
"But how is this possible?"
"I'm starting to get hungry."
"He is a great man."
"Did she talk about me?"
"This is my grandfather."
"Where did he go?"
"I did you a favor."
"So what are you going to do?"
"No, no, everything is fine."
"Everyone is."
"Are you going to school?"
"Am I dreaming?"
"I feel so much better."
"Go get some water."
"I didn't plan for that."
"That's all for me."
"It means a lot to me."
"It means a lot to me."
"Who is speaking?"
"I'll call you a taxi."
"I told you so."
"What do you think of him?"
"It's a small world, isn't it?"
"I have visitors."
"Orders are orders."
"I don't speak Spanish."
"No, it's mine."
"Would you listen to me?"
"This is real life."
"Do you want to do something?"
"What are we supposed to do?"
"Forever and ever."
"We'll take care of the rest."
"I hope you understand."
"Are you here for that?"
"Do something for me."
"What good wind brings you?"
"Who else knows?"
"How long will it last?"
"I heard something."
"I'm looking forward to it."
"It's pretty good."
"They need you."
"Who said otherwise?"
"You are on air."
"Wait, I have an idea."
"You are at home here."
"You are at home here."
"He never came."
"Don't say a word."
"Don't say a word."
"Anyone want anything?"
"Who else is there?"
"Let me come with you."
"I was born like this."
"How many are we at?"
"Let's face it."
"We all have secrets."
"What are you here for?"
"It's as easy as pie."
"You have to trust me."
"I needed air."
"He is in his office."
"I'm just asking."
"How long has he been here?"
"I let her go."
"If it makes you happy."
"I thought of you."
"We've all seen it."
"Don't say anything."
"Don't ask me."
"It's really something."
"You need me."
"Do you know how much it costs?"
"Do you have water?"
"Who gave it to you?"
"I like this place."
"Everything is going as planned."
"I just wanted to talk to him."
"I am an old man."
"All you need."
"Anywhere but here."
"Yes, that's how it is."
"Can I take a shower?"
"I thought I was clear."
"Because I love you."
"What's that noise?"
"Never seen in my life."
"Take a look."
"You do as you wish."
"You look surprised."
"You look surprised."
"What's the connection?"
"I'll have to go."
"What did you give him?"
"A little help?"
"Can't you talk?"
"What are you doing around here?"
"What are you doing around here?"
"It's for work."
"Your face is familiar to me."
"We took care of it."
"Who wouldn't be?"
"And what did you do?"
"And what did you do?"
"Get him out of here."
"You're family."
"Who asked you?"
"Do you know where he lives?"
"Something is going on."
"Please come in."
"Please come in."
"Why did you come here?"
"What time is it?"
"I am proud of you."
"He taught me everything."
"I still don't know."
"Nice to have met you."
"Nice to meet you."
"Ten years ago."
"To what do I owe this honor?"
"I barely knew her."
"They are inside."
"You have a lot to learn."
"It's against the law."
"Do you need money?"
"He's a good cop."
"Tell me who you are."
"Tell me who you are."
"Why are you making that face?"
"Someone wants to see you."
"I can live with that."
"Isn't it obvious?"
"No, I don't find it."
"Of course I know."
"You are blacklisted."
"It's another world."
"This is standard procedure."
"This has to change."
"Did you have fun?"
"You should go see him."
"I taught him everything."
"One after the other."
"Glad to be back."
"Have a great weekend."
"Of course you can."
"Have you seen this man?"
"What are you talking about, man?"
"This is who I am."
"I saw one."
"Can you hold this for me?"
"Do you want me to stay?"
"You've crossed the line."
"I love you even more."
"What's the idea?"
"You are the boss."
"No need to thank me."
"They didn't say anything."
"It's a long journey."
"How can this be?"
"Madam, please."
"Who is that one?"
"For me, it's the same."
"We are safe here."
"What's your story?"
"No, I don't know."
"This is a historic moment."
"I agree."
"I swear I don't."
"What do I owe the pleasure?"
"We must find a solution."
"A boy or a girl?"
"Hopefully."
"Will you buy me a drink?"
"Can I have a drink?"
"Where do we start?"
"The investigation is ongoing."
"Which side are you on?"
"But you don't understand."
"I see you there."
"You never listen to me."
"What's that for?"
"This is awesome."
"No need to shout."
"Who doesn't have one?"
"It's just an expression."
"I came for this."
"He is in love with you."
"Isn't he cute?"
"How are we going to do it?"
"No, I didn't say anything."
"The journey was long."
"I'm inside."
"She'll get over it."
"We have the green light."
"Would you please calm down?"
"That's already something."
"You have to let me go."
"Do you have to go somewhere?"
"I don't love him anymore."
"A while ago."
"Do as you feel."
"What else do you have?"
"I told him about it."
"This is not fun."
"Actually, not at all."
"And who is he?"
"Do you want to eat something?"
"You're a good guy."
"How do you know him?"
"That's him over there."
"I'll get it for you."
"Call me whenever you want."
"Something like that, yes."
"Do you want to see something?"
"I told you."
"I told you so."
"Thank you for doing this."
"You are my only friend."
"What did you expect?"
"I dropped it."
"What's left?"
"Where can I find it?"
"Don't you understand that?"
"You have to get used to it."
"Don't you see?"
"Are you really going to do that?"
"This is against the rules."
"What can I tell you?"
"May God be with you."
"You got me good."
"What do you remember?"
"Don't just stand there."
"I can't say."
"This is insanity."
"How is it different?"
"I've been here before."
"It's right next door."
"It's going to be okay, darling."
"You asked for it."
"I want money."
"I just made it up."
"I heard the news."
"This is a unique opportunity."
"So, what do you think?"
"How can you do that?"
"Everyone loved him."
"This is my grandson."
"You are my only family."
"Would you excuse us?"
"He's a good kid."
"See you later, guys."
"Thank you for coming with me."
"Can I make a suggestion?"
"Do you want some?"
"Do you want some?"
"I'm just making conversation."
"You're a good dog."
"What do you expect from me?"
"I thought about that too."
"Why are you interested in this?"
"You still don't understand?"
"I don't want to play."
"How did you get this?"
"How did you get this?"
"How did you get this?"
"I have a clear conscience."
"They shot him."
"I need information."
"This has to stay between us."
"She asked me."
"She doesn't speak English."
"You always have."
"I needed this."
"He looks happy."
"What do you think of me?"
"Who is this guy?"
"She's a little girl."
"Everyone will be there."
"I'm on a case."
"Do you want another one?"
"Do you want another one?"
"I owe you my life."
"I got the message."
"What are you doing there?"
"This is an important decision."
"But I saw it."
"I'll show it to you."
"That's good, my daughter."
"I did the math."
"I did what was necessary."
"What is it, exactly?"
"We'll discuss it later."
"What should I call you?"
"How did you find us?"
"Where did you get that from?"
"Did you say something?"
"Take good care of her."
"I'd like a drink."
"I'd love a drink."
"You have made your choice."
"You had your chance."
"I'll be back in a few minutes."
"I received your message."
"I'll find something."
"I want her back."
"Thank you for everything."
"And you, what do you do?"
"You are like the others."
"You are like everyone else."
"I don't even know."
"They don't have any."
"We just did it."
"He is in great shape."
"What can I do about it?"
"I need reinforcements."
"It's time to act."
"You can't know."
"What is your favorite color?"
"It's a big city."
"Did you see his face?"
"Don't tell him that."
"I've never done it."
"What's that face?"
"You did it on purpose."
"But I have to do it."
"What am I doing here?"
"I can tell you."
"I gave it a try."
"It's in your best interest."
"But he did."
"What he did."
"You're welcome, madam."
"How can I know?"
"But I beg you."
"Did I really say that?"
"How do we get out of here?"
"Did you see anything?"
"He is a little boy."
"You are in charge."
"I could have done it."
"We just arrived."
"Do you see who it is?"
"He decides."
"Thank you very much for coming."
"Do you want to please me?"
"Unity is strength."
"I've known him forever."
"What is he doing there?"
"I know, you're right."
"What was that for?"
"Five minutes ago."
"Yes, yes, that's it."
"This is where we are."
"How can I thank you?"
"I must have passed out."
"There are several."
"May God rest his soul."
"Have you heard from him?"
"Have you heard from him?"
"And you did it."
"No one saw her."
"I love you anyway."
"Give me some water."
"I feel so good."
"She told me everything."
"You just have to ask."
"What happened here?"
"That means something."
"I need to check something."
"I haven't decided."
"You didn't have to."
"There is progress."
"It's easy for you."
"He is a good dog."
"What are they going to do to him?"
"I can assure you of that."
"I can assure you of that."
"That's a good one."
"That's the idea."
"No, I'm fine."
"They are not human."
"How did you find it?"
"How did you find it?"
"You can tell me anything."
"She didn't answer."
"Do you want to talk?"
"Where did you meet?"
"Why do you always do this?"
"How long are you staying?"
"I'll get the keys."
"Okay, I have to go."
"You ask too many questions."
"Leave it, I'll take care of it."
"You took everything from me."
"What do you need?"
"What do you need?"
"What is your real name?"
"I took the bus."
"I'll turn the question back on you."
"When did you talk to him?"
"To your battle stations."
"How are you tonight?"
"Shall I drop you off somewhere?"
"Shall I drop you off somewhere?"
"Where did you hide it?"
"There is a connection."
"Please leave a message."
"What did you do with it?"
"I'll see you tomorrow morning."
"Do what you can."
"It's important to him."
"It's a lucky charm."
"I have to go too."
"What have I done?"
"Please come out."
"Can you take care of it?"
"He's there, somewhere."
"I have to go to work."
"That's very kind, thank you."
"It's poetry."
"How are we doing?"
"Is that your last word?"
"Make yourself comfortable."
"Not a second longer."
"Can I take your order?"
"I made sure of it."
"Drink some water."
"I have something for you."
"What do you do with that?"
"Because you love me."
"I just met him."
"You'll get over it."
"Give me money."
"It's Valentine's Day."
"But it's a start."
"It happened this morning."
"I can manage on my own."
"Yes, I like it."
"He was a good cop."
"Are you in love with her?"
"We need this."
"Yes, I can do that."
"Sorry to call so late."
"What do you expect?"
"Here's what I think."
"I would be grateful."
"It has to come out."
"Do you want to know a secret?"
"I got over it."
"Time will tell."
"And how do we do that?"
"We've just started."
"I read your book."
"No, it's not good."
"I got the message."
"I'm going to close the door."
"Who is in charge here?"
"How did I get here?"
"Excuse me, please."
"I'll see you there."
"He must be somewhere."
"I went to see him."
"Permission to board?"
"There were some everywhere."
"It's him or me."
"You should go talk to him."
"Step aside."
"How did he get there?"
"It reminds me of someone."
"What's his story?"
"She shot me."
"Do you understand anything about it?"
"Do you need anything?"
"It's time for a change."
"You can't what?"
"How long have you been here?"
"How long have you been here?"
"How long have you been here?"
"We must stop him."
"What is the cause?"
"A man or a woman?"
"It's time to vote."
"You can't even imagine."
"You look happy."
"I was at home."
"I offer you my condolences."
"I wonder that too."
"I know, I was there."
"Where did the others go?"
"You have nothing to say?"
"No, on the other side."
"I'm still the same."
"What else do you know?"
"We're going to the beach."
"That's just my luck."
"Everyone loves it."
"This better work."
"And I'm proud of it."
"I told him no."
"What do you think I am?"
"Who told you about it?"
"What's it called again?"
"I always loved her."
"Someone came here."
"I learned my lesson."
"This is a great job."
"What is this music?"
"He's loaded."
"Can you believe it?"
"You got up early."
"You got up early."
"You've thought of everything."
"It was in the newspaper."
"She is a pretty girl."
"Do you want a drink?"
"Would you like a drink?"
"All right, you know what?"
"You should go to bed."
"Do you want to have a drink?"
"All I have."
"Is that the plan?"
"It's a beautiful night."
"Do you want to come with me?"
"Do you have another idea?"
"Nice to see you."
"Oh, I almost forgot."
"I found one."
"I'm feeling a little peckish."
"We have to move."
"Have you talked to him about it?"
"It's not pretty."
"I saw the video."
"For me, anyway."
"How did he take it?"
"I want this to work."
"Everyone loves Raymond."
"Do you remember us?"
"It's just an impression."
"You should have seen that."
"But what is this?"
"What did you do next?"
"Do you want me to continue?"
"I'll give you a hint."
"Are we really going to do this?"
"I have to go see him."
"What's your secret?"
"I have to leave you."
"Didn't you hear me?"
"Who are you telling?"
"That's good for you."
"You're a good guy."
"But it's worth it."
"I want to live with you."
"I always thought so."
"What did you think?"
"Can you take care of it?"
"This is a good place."
"As far as I know."
"It makes me very happy."
"It's upside down."
"I want to see my wife."
"She was everything to me."
"I want to know the truth."
"This is how we're going to do it."
"Isn't that enough?"
"Did he tell you about it?"
"Do you have any change?"
"We did it together."
"You're just in time."
"You did your duty."
"I can take you there."
"I'm going to take a picture."
"Shall we have a coffee?"
"He must be around there."
"Do you do weight training?"
"It's going to be a piece of cake."
"I agree with you."
"It's in the newspapers."
"Don't you see it?"
"I'll talk to you later."
"What is the occasion?"
"Thanks for letting me know."
"I just met her."
"I want him to leave."
"What do we do with him?"
"It's just a precaution."
"Can you close the door?"
"So, what do you think?"
"Have you seen a doctor?"
"You have to get out of here."
"You have to get out of here."
"You are a good man."
"I was just asking."
"I won't be."
"And what happened?"
"It's a little late."
"What are you doing to me now?"
"What did I tell you?"
"And I will always love you."
"The customer is always right."
"Four years ago."
"What have I done to you?"
"And I thank you for that."
"Do you have any aspirin?"
"Who did this to him?"
"Are you ready to go?"
"No, I have nothing."
"But we don't care."
"I took care of it."
"You're not ready."
"How did he know?"
"And I will do it."
"Let it stay between us."
"Where did you find it?"
"I volunteered."
"There is a cure."
"This is a beautiful photo."
"Yes, please."
"No, I'm not hungry."
"And I thank you for that."
"That's for me."
"She won't know anything about it."
"It's time to grow up."
"What do I do with this?"
"I don't know, man."
"Don't you see it?"
"I'm going to the bathroom."
"Do you live nearby?"
"I let him do it."
"How can you know that?"
"I have to go to town."
"I need a doctor."
"I'm pretty sure of it."
"Want to take a ride?"
"You know, you're right."
"God bless America."
"You have to go home."
"We have a lot of work."
"That's my real name."
"I understood very well."
"I'm happy for you."
"Your price will be mine."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Why did you say that?"
"There was a man."
"And what am I?"
"I know where we are."
"Why did you do that?"
"I need to make a call."
"Did you have an accident?"
"It took time."
"It's science."
"Do you have water?"
"Who does she think she is?"
"I'll take you at your word."
"What difference does it make?"
"You should do the same."
"What do you want to talk about?"
"I didn't think about it."
"But it's over now."
"But what does that mean?"
"Everyone loves it."
"Do you want another beer?"
"Take good care of yourself."
"I'm going to do it."
"I'm in the phone book."
"I'll send you the address."
"How could he?"
"It seems important."
"You should see a doctor."
"I have a little girl."
"Where were you last night?"
"If only I knew."
"It's a bit tight."
"I've been looking for you everywhere."
"I gave him everything."
"I want to apologize."
"I did my best."
"At your place or mine?"
"This is my stepfather."
"It's like riding a bike."
"Are you ready for this?"
"What did you want to tell me?"
"What did you want to tell me?"
"I really love you very much."
"Please leave."
"Where are everyone else?"
"Did you see his face?"
"She didn't leave."
"There is coffee."
"Who do you think we are?"
"I'm past the age."
"What did you do to them?"
"Where did that come from?"
"They are not there."
"She went that way."
"You're going to be late."
"Who let you in?"
"Hey, what's this?"
"He's right, you know."
"There must be some."
"No, I couldn't."
"She didn't see anything."
"And what is it?"
"It was not intended."
"It's quite a story."
"Have you been here before?"
"How did he get here?"
"I know I can."
"We must go."
"Where is he hiding?"
"What do you remember?"
"Do you want to get out of here?"
"Smoking is prohibited."
"How many children do you have?"
"I have to go there."
"I know where you're going."
"We're going to have a lot of fun."
"I'll tell you everything."
"What is happening to us?"
"Okay, I'll do it."
"How did you find it?"
"Can I buy you a coffee?"
"I want to see my brother."
"It's almost time."
"It would do you good."
"When did you see her?"
"Have you read the newspapers?"
"Thank you for helping me."
"Are we really going to do it?"
"You are a nice boy."
"All that is over."
"I'll get it for you."
"He told us."
"I have lots of ideas."
"I think the same thing."
"Don't go any further."
"And you, what's new?"
"So what do we do now?"
"No need to do that."
"Maybe we should leave."
"Say what you think."
"They left that way."
"Do you know where he is?"
"But it was worth it."
"Show some respect."
"There was one."
"I know everything about you."
"Did you take your medication?"
"Yes, that's the truth."
"I am a police officer."
"How did you find out?"
"Do you want to talk to me about it?"
"How did it end?"
"Don't talk about it."
"I will be there for you."
"I heard screams."
"How dare you say that?"
"I get chills."
"Exactly what I thought."
"We'll take care of it."
"All of you."
"I want to know more."
"I'm talking nonsense."
"Like everyone else here."
"I will take care of him."
"Did you do all that?"
"She was a good girl."
"Yes, you did."
"It's part of the process."
"This is my last offer."
"It comes from above."
"She's an old friend."
"How did you get here?"
"I am a good mother."
"It's a private party."
"We can find a solution."
"It's over for you."
"Can I stay with you?"
"I promised you."
"I'm done talking."
"Glad you're here."
"Do you all agree?"
"I saw her yesterday."
"Does that answer your question?"
"Do you want another drink?"
"It will do me good."
"See you later."
"I'll go upstairs and look."
"I have a little idea."
"You should come with me."
"You should have seen it."
"I can afford it."
"I'll get you out."
"I need advice."
"I dreamed of you."
"Who is this girl?"
"And how do you know that?"
"Did he really say that?"
"How are you this morning?"
"I've been doing this for a long time."
"I'm going inside."
"This is the second time."
"What do you know about me?"
"Yeah, I remember that."
"No, I'll go."
"I'll take you there."
"How are things going there?"
"The decision has been made."
"The one and only."
"What is this word?"
"I know everyone."
"I don't mind."
"He is capable of anything."
"Everyone is happy."
"Lock the door."
"Have you notified the police?"
"I was just passing by."
"Attention, please."
"Of course it's okay."
"They are making fun of us."
"I know a lot of things."
"You are a good person."
"I would have liked to see that."
"Prepare for impact."
"Feels good, huh?"
"It's for a friend."
"But we can't."
"Someone had to do it."
"It's a safe place."
"What do you think of her?"
"It's a real miracle."
"Who are these?"
"We made a deal."
"I have it in visual."
"You're coming with me."
"Want to know more?"
"I will never forgive him."
"But I have a question."
"I'm in."
"I've already spoken to him."
"It's next week."
"Are there any survivors?"
"You are a good father."
"Do you need anything?"
"Do you need something?"
"Nothing will happen to you."
"I want to stay with you."
"It's always been you."
"My watch stopped."
"Anyone have a pen?"
"Do I look good?"
"Nice to see you again."
"I'll be back in a few hours."
"It brings back memories."
"I'm just getting started."
"Can I borrow this?"
"She must be somewhere."
"She made her choice."
"You will hear from me."
"You look like your mother."
"I'll get the doctor."
"I think so."
"So where were we?"
"So, where were we?"
"Have you seen this guy?"
"I'm in the kitchen."
"What a joy to see you again."
"Nobody said anything."
"I came back for you."
"How did you get here?"
"I tried to call."
"It was just a dream."
"I just got married."
"Nice to meet you."
"Have you known each other for a long time?"
"Do you have any others?"
"Do you have any others?"
"She went home."
"You took your time."
"She's in the car."
"What do you know about her?"
"I feel good here."
"He's making fun of us."
"I'll call you later."
"It's in the air."
"I'm at the hotel."
"You can trust him."
"I will be in my room."
"Who is she?"
"I have to go to court."
"I was there first."
"I'm doing this for us."
"You can go now."
"You can go now."
"I put the speaker on."
"It's good for him."
"I could have helped you."
"She isn't anymore."
"I have a double call."
"Yes, I thought about it."
"And you, what do you want?"
"I'm going to look for him."
"I'll call a taxi."
"Isn't he handsome?"
"He's a good kid."
"And you, how are you?"
"You always knew it."
"In a car accident."
"I followed your advice."
"I'll stay a little while."
"Can you wait a second?"
"Close the door behind you."
"Any questions?"
"Or something like that."
"Shall we have a drink?"
"Shall we have a drink?"
"There are children."
"Tell him to call me."
"All right, here we go."
"Ask anyone."
"And I agree."
"I know it by heart."
"As if it were possible."
"Is this your first time?"
"Consider it done."
"Consider it done."
"It's starting to get good."
"Maybe I am."
"I hope so for you."
"I've never had one."
"Good luck to you both."
"I have to take care of it."
"I want to see his face."
"You're deluding yourself."
"Nothing to do with you."
"She did not survive."
"I read your mind."
"I already said yes."
"Have you seen her before?"
"Have you seen her before?"
"I should have listened to you."
"I saw it coming."
"I've thought about it a lot."
"He needs care."
"What are you doing tonight?"
"What you did."
"I kept you waiting."
"Can I ask you why?"
"All right, I'll go."
"How did she get there?"
"Thank you for waiting for me."
"I forgot the name."
"We should do something."
"No, never in my life."
"She's a good girl."
"Thank you for this lovely evening."
"I want to have a baby."
"Everything will be fine for me."
"There's more to it than that."
"That's what I'm saying."
"What do you want?"
"I do it for us."
"Please sign."
"No, that won't work."
"What's your thing?"
"I have served my sentence."
"We'll do it together."
"You tell me."
"Is there a phone?"
"I'm very proud of it."
"What do you have to say?"
"If you agree."
"Are you comfortable?"
"We need to talk."
"What if he's right?"
"Go back to where you came from."
"We have a lot in common."
"It's your choice."
"He came for me."
"What do we know about him?"
"You did your job."
"How old is your son?"
"There was a woman."
"There are more."
"Yes, we did it."
"We can take care of it."
"I thought I was clear."
"You read my mind."
"Go ahead, both of you."
"I'm moving forward."
"It's thanks to me."
"Give me some."
"Far be it from me to think so."
"Nice to meet you."
"She had a stroke."
"How is your day going?"
"It's up to you."
"I like being with you."
"We just learned it."
"You have the answer to everything."
"No, I just arrived."
"So, what are you going to do?"
"Open, please."
"We'll take care of her."
"This is a good sign."
"I'm fine, thank you."
"Better not to know."
"Since when do you know that?"
"I'm dating someone."
"But this is different."
"I have to go back there."
"She's family."
"Don't you want to come in?"
"Have you seen anyone?"
"Nice to finally meet you."
"Try to get some sleep."
"How did you meet him?"
"I can come back later."
"It's the good life."
"You don't have it?"
"And I love you too."
"We made a decision."
"How did I get here?"
"I came to get you."
"But I have a plan."
"Everything happens for a reason."
"What did you talk about?"
"He just did it."
"There, I agree."
"It's about me."
"And you, what are you doing?"
"I love you, my darling."
"You will come with us."
"We are proud of you."
"We are proud of you."
"There is more important."
"Who will be eliminated tonight?"
"I wanted to make sure."
"It freaks me out."
"I have to earn a living."
"It happens like this."
"May I use your phone?"
"This is normal procedure."
"I'm right next door."
"You know what else?"
"I was in the shower."
"I need some information."
"I'll get to it."
"It's going to be a long day."
"I love you too."
"I felt something."
"I'm from home."
"We have to move forward."
"It's about us."
"Where is my little girl?"
"When is your birthday?"
"This is what I am."
"I'll take note of that."
"Please come."
"Please come."
"It's a good movie."
"It's quite the opposite."
"Nice to see you."
"Since I'm telling you."
"I challenge you."
"He took everything from me."
"What did the police say?"
"It was just once."
"What do you want in return?"
"Who is inside?"
"It's just around the corner."
"Can you come pick me up?"
"I asked first."
"My throat is dry."
"You have to come with us."
"I can't sing."
"How long have you been married?"
"It's a nice surprise."
"It's in my head."
"It's going to cost you dearly."
"But what are you doing here?"
"But what are you doing here?"
"At the end of the street."
"Yes, I remember."
"The police are on their way."
"You can be sure of it."
"It is a heavy responsibility."
"Why are you telling me this?"
"He was a nice guy."
"Can you be more specific?"
"Can you be more specific?"
"Who shot you?"
"Who shot you?"
"Can I have this dance?"
"I read your report."
"Nobody did it."
"Where did you see that?"
"What did you expect?"
"I've already read it."
"I feel at home."
"These things take time."
"Can you give us a minute?"
"As you said."
"Isn't it wonderful?"
"Do you have another idea?"
"How long are you going for?"
"I'll take care of that."
"I'll take care of that."
"It's on my list."
"Honey, please."
"What are you going to do now?"
"I ask you a question."
"Maybe it's better."
"We still have time."
"I am another man."
"I really need it."
"Take me in your arms."
"I'm at the airport."
"I gave it to you."
"Do you want to say something?"
"Everyone on the floor."
"I'm sorry for everything."
"What do you want to tell me?"
"It's better for you."
"You look somewhere else."
"Isn't that right, Mom?"
"I got a promotion."
"I'm going to take the bus."
"Can I watch TV?"
"What do you expect from me?"
"I only see that."
"Have we met before?"
"I'm going to say hello to him."
"You make a beautiful couple."
"How do we do it?"
"What does that mean?"
"I'll go get the others."
"I have better than that."
"What are you going to call him?"
"Yes, she did."
"Does he have family?"
"How can you know that?"
"What will she do?"
"Are you ready to go?"
"She is in the kitchen."
"I already told you."
"We have to go home."
"Peace be with you."
"He promised me."
"Because it is necessary."
"How did you get in here?"
"How did you get in here?"
"How do you know my name?"
"How do you know my name?"
"It's a special occasion."
"I'm going to the library."
"He came to me."
"Yes, it's very pretty."
"What are you talking about?"
"Are you coming for a ride?"
"I was going to tell you."
"Did you think of me?"
"He's a good boy."
"And his last name?"
"You are always welcome."
"There is a catch."
"What is his real name?"
"No, I don't know."
"How are you going to do that?"
"Let's not talk about this anymore."
"It's his first day."
"Where did you see it?"
"I completely agree."
"Who told you that?"
"That's the secret."
"Glad you like it."
"He told me about it."
"Did you see anything?"
"I was thinking about something."
"Don't forget to breathe."
"Give me one good reason."
"At your command, my Commander."
"There is a word."
"I'll call you a taxi."
"He's your best friend."
"Why did you come here?"
"Let's see what we have."
"She didn't tell me anything."
"I remember everything."
"Am I making myself clear?"
"It is, isn't it?"
"What would I do without you?"
"That's what you're here for."
"What do I mean?"
"I'll go around."
"I hope to see you again soon."
"I read his file."
"I asked him why."
"All I want?"
"I'll see you later."
"I'll see you later."
"Are you on his side?"
"You took your time."
"It took you a while."
"Do you need anything else?"
"Please stay."
"Please stay."
"I just remembered."
"I didn't go there."
"I need more."
"You don't like them?"
"From head to toe."
"He is an old man."
"You just said it."
"We were just talking."
"There are laws."
"Very good, that's good."
"It's in the contract."
"It might take a while."
"I'm going to call my lawyer."
"You have done your duty."
"She's going to have a baby."
"It's a family tradition."
"Go ahead, I'll join you."
"Why did you say that?"
"Do you want to see my room?"
"I am the strongest."
"He needed me."
"You don't know what?"
"Mom, I have to go."
"The honor is mine."
"No, you don't want to."
"I'm going to get some coffee."
"You have beautiful eyes."
"I don't see her anymore."
"That's for later."
"It's on the way."
"How is my little girl?"
"I want to thank you."
"It's a good price."
"Don't you like her?"
"Come sit with us."
"But I have an idea."
"Yes, I read it."
"What's your head?"
"My God, it's true."
"Oh, I have to go."
"You don't need to."
"It's a private club."
"There is movement."
"She would have told me."
"Take him to the hospital."
"You know everyone."
"Have you seen his eyes?"
"Everything is going very well."
"Can we talk somewhere?"
"I do it for myself."
"Come join us."
"That gives me an idea."
"I have to go back to town."
"What was it about?"
"It won't last long."
"Did you learn something?"
"How are you, my dear?"
"Do you want to leave here?"
"How did he react?"
"I have to talk to him."
"You will be safe here."
"You will be safe here."
"I'll join you later."
"Please answer."
"That's something."
"You are free to go."
"Don't let him in."
"We need proof."
"The pleasure is ours."
"I'm looking forward to seeing you again."
"You have to make a decision."
"Where did it happen?"
"What am I going to tell him?"
"Does your mother know?"
"Go sit over there."
"It looks perfect."
"You tell me something."
"I'm going to get a doctor."
"Who put this there?"
"Everyone to bed."
"Put it on the table."
"How did she get here?"
"Look at what you're doing."
"It was a good plan."
"It means a lot to me."
"It's not yours."
"Will you grant me this dance?"
"And what do I do with it?"
"I'm fine like this."
"Of course I want to."
"It's in his nature."
"No, I'm happy to."
"I'm sorry, guys."
"You're doing well."
"I am an open book."
"You fought well."
"I can't hear anything anymore."
"Why are you still here?"
"Why are you still here?"
"You'll pay for this."
"Have you lived here for a long time?"
"Next, please."
"Thank you for talking to me."
"Okay, whatever you want."
"There is time."
"We're right in the middle of it."
"You should have seen it."
"You remind me of someone."
"He is everything to me."
"I'm out of ammo."
"I thought you would understand."
"She looks happy."
"You did very well."
"I have no one left."
"It's a beautiful place."
"I've seen some before."
"The sun is going to rise."
"I will continue to search."
"What are you talking about?"
"They told me."
"I want to go home."
"It's in the newspaper."
"I was told that."
"What am I going to do?"
"You have to promise me."
"Are there any others?"
"I knew you would understand."
"My name is Oliver Queen."
"Will you excuse me for a second?"
"Yeah, something like that."
"Of course I understand."
"What can I offer you?"
"Do you want to eat something?"
"I thought about that."
"I won't do anything to you."
"See you at lunch."
"What is this supposed to be?"
"I had an affair."
"It's an incredible story."
"Where is he now?"
"You can't read?"
"There was something."
"Is that his real name?"
"The pleasure was mine."
"I have the right."
"What's that over there?"
"I want to go there too."
"He is safe and sound."
"She's all yours."
"You've come at the right time."
"No, it was an accident."
"How did you get it?"
"How did you get it?"
"How did you get it?"
"He was kind to me."
"They should already be here."
"I have them on me."
"You must know something."
"I'm the boss."
"Is this supposed to comfort me?"
"Can I take your coat?"
"Time is against us."
"I received a letter."
"How are you this morning?"
"It's a little different."
"I will find a way."
"I'm good at it."
"You can open your eyes."
"It suits you very well."
"Can we talk for a minute?"
"Did you see it well?"
"This is my last day."
"What should I tell them?"
"I saw your car."
"I never do."
"Have you ever seen it?"
"I'm going to have a drink."
"I can't understand."
"You can count on us."
"You can count on us."
"I want to see my children."
"I vouch for it."
"Try not to move."
"No, not right now."
"I had to leave."
"I can do both."
"Would you excuse me?"
"Do you really want to do it?"
"I need to understand."
"A decision must be made."
"She's not far away."
"I am not her."
"I have all day."
"I'm proud of him."
"The whole town is talking about it."
"I swear it."
"We'll get along well."
"Just ask."
"I got over it."
"Is this your girlfriend?"
"How did this happen?"
"I found mine."
"I need a coffee."
"It's no longer worth it."
"When did you do this?"
"I remember it perfectly."
"You watch too much TV."
"He's in the back."
"He is on the roof."
"I thought you knew."
"It's me, your father."
"No time for that."
"Maybe we should."
"How did you find us?"
"If you want to follow me."
"No, I don't drink."
"You should come see this."
"Have you known him for a long time?"
"Can I stay a little?"
"This is for you."
"Don't you like him?"
"Yes, he did."
"This is a new record."
"What do you have for me?"
"I am happy for you."
"I will never forgive you."
"I'm going to my office."
"That's good, man."
"Not so good."
"I didn't think about it."
"Is this supposed to impress me?"
"Did I tell you that?"
"I just started."
"I forgot your name."
"Did you take anything?"
"It's fashionable."
"That's good, very good."
"Are you proud of yourself?"
"Some more coffee?"
"Thanks for the help."
"Have you ever seen this?"
"No, it's the opposite."
"What do you want to do there?"
"Don't you see?"
"You are like your mother."
"Have you seen the news?"
"We're on the case."
"What's wrong?"
"I'm done for the day."
"How did you end up here?"
"Let me be very clear."
"You are a big girl."
"How did I do that?"
"Can you do something?"
"It's from me."
"What's your excuse?"
"I'll tell you everything."
"It's just dinner."
"Because I can."
"Don't even think about it."
"We'll talk about it later."
"I got out of it."
"Put yourself in his shoes."
"That's the whole point."
"You don't know them."
"I've never heard of that."
"Please stay."
"The director wants to see you."
"He is in the shower."
"I ask myself questions."
"I feel safe."
"I just want to see him."
"I don't have any."
"We keep each other informed."
"Until next time."
"No, I'm coming with you."
"In the glove compartment."
"And what did you say?"
"That's good, my dear."
"Or something like that."
"There is a tunnel."
"You look different."
"I am a great admirer."
"Maybe you're right."
"I'll give you a chance."
"No, we can't."
"Where did you get it?"
"He is always late."
"This is just the beginning."
"I read your file."
"This is who you are."
"Where do you know him from?"
"Because it's important."
"I always loved him."
"Where did you get them?"
"Come, please."
"Where did you get it from?"
"I try to be."
"I would do it for you."
"I have to get up."
"Let's go, girls."
"Guess what it is."
"This is the right choice."
"If you want me."
"Is everything okay there?"
"I go where I want."
"Don't you feel it?"
"You'll never get there."
"Nice to meet you."
"Keep an eye on him."
"We are on the same side."
"Please leave."
"Who doesn't like that?"
"I opened the door."
"I totally agree."
"You should do the same."
"Who could have done this?"
"I would have told you."
"It's an honor, sir."
"Yes, I promise you."
"I should have done it."
"You have to tell me."
"Are you sure?"
"What was in it?"
"I was just going to call you."
"Did you see his face?"
"He's a good guy."
"A body was found."
"But I found this."
"Yes, I told him."
"I'll give it to you as a gift."
"I'll give you some."
"Please leave."
"I brush my teeth."
"She's doing well."
"But you already know that."
"You are a good son."
"I feel really good."
"I need reinforcements."
"We have all the time in the world."
"This is a unique opportunity."
"I am a married woman."
"No, not at the moment."
"He looked good."
"What do you want from us?"
"It's quality."
"All you have."
"You are a good boy."
"I want to be part of it."
"Where did you meet him?"
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"I had to tell you."
"I really like you."
"He did it on purpose."
"I've always lived here."
"Don't say his name."
"Where did you find it?"
"I really should go."
"I work for the CIA."
"No, I don't like it."
"What did they do to you?"
"What have I done to you?"
"This is the only possibility."
"This is a private conversation."
"I don't live here."
"What should I do now?"
"He was asking for it."
"How many are left?"
"Haven't you seen it?"
"Take good care of him."
"Whose car is this?"
"We're in the right place."
"Maybe you were right."
"What are you all doing here?"
"He knocks on the door."
"I wish I could have been there."
"I wish I could have been there."
"You'll never believe me."
"What did he tell you?"
"There are witnesses."
"Is everything okay between us?"
"I only have you."
"It's almost dawn."
"I called the cops."
"She never came back."
"And not just any old one."
"What else do you have?"
"What else do you have?"
"You let him go?"
"Can't you do better?"
"I'm going to do the dishes."
"We have a lot in common."
"You are in great shape."
"More than you think."
"How is this possible?"
"I am full of surprises."
"Thank you for having me."
"I love you, my baby."
"You'll never know."
"You already said that."
"You do your best."
"Where were you thinking?"
"It's going very well."
"We just talked."
"It's past midnight."
"This guy is a genius."
"You are not pregnant."
"Don't trust him."
"Everyone knows each other."
"He retired."
"Why are you talking about this?"
"Of everything and nothing."
"One foot in front of the other."
"I can handle this."
"How did you get here?"
"How do I look?"
"I only want you."
"Do you remember his name?"
"This is what we know."
"I want to see my mom."
"It was just a kiss."
"I've always been there."
"You'll get used to it."
"It's for my son."
"Come on, you can do it."
"It's a big house."
"Why do you want to do this?"
"Maybe I should."
"Would you buy me a drink?"
"You thought of everything."
"We just talk."
"Nobody blames you."
"He's talking nonsense."
"Who else was there?"
"Everything's fine, sweetie."
"I don't think I can."
"This is what you are."
"This is what you are."
"Look who I found."
"Attention, everyone."
"How did you learn it?"
"How did you know?"
"How did you find out?"
"How did you learn it?"
"Just tell me one thing."
"You still don't understand?"
"You've made your decision."
"I want to make a good impression."
"That's a good point."
"I just found out."
"You have to make a choice."
"Who takes care of you?"
"How long have we known each other?"
"And I apologize for that."
"Did you receive my letter?"
"I'll take care of it, boss."
"Did he do this to you?"
"It's a hobby."
"What are you getting involved in?"
"It's in the file."
"I had a feeling."
"Thank you for taking me."
"We'll take care of that."
"I can prove it to you."
"I saw the light."
"I've had my fill."
"She didn't come home."
"Can I say a word?"
"It was given to me."
"I already asked him."
"Where did you learn that?"
"Would you excuse us for a moment?"
"I'll get you out of here."
"Can I have your number?"
"I'm from the CIA."
"It's nice of you to ask."
"Did you have a good trip?"
"I love you too, baby."
"I don't want to."
"It's part of the job."
"I'm just asking."
"It's windy."
"I'll see you later."
"Did they find anything?"
"No need to answer."
"Smoking is not allowed."
"I have many friends."
"What can you tell me?"
"No, it's not the same."
"I'm ready to go."
"I go to church."
"I ask you the question again."
"I want him back."
"I owe you an explanation."
"What if it was me?"
"What time do you finish?"
"What am I getting at?"
"She is safe and sound."
"Tickets, please."
"I got rid of it."
"Have you ever seen this?"
"I just wanted to say hello."
"You are really very beautiful."
"I knew it would work."
"How much do you have on you?"
"You had your chance."
"I had an appointment."
"He is on our side."
"What did I tell you?"
"What is your name?"
"She would never do that."
"We can do it here."
"You need to know."
"I tell you no."
"I will find another way."
"I still remember it."
"She's not mine."
"Maybe next time."
"I promised you."
"And what are you going to do?"
"I went shopping."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Glad you came."
"So what should I do?"
"The rain has stopped."
"Do you want me to continue?"
"No, I don't believe it."
"He jumped on me."
"Where did you find them?"
"Where did you find them?"
"Come on, let's have fun."
"You changed your hairstyle."
"Who gave it to you?"
"He is a handsome boy."
"I'll see him later."
"Where did you get that from?"
"I can keep a secret."
"I closed my eyes."
"I am in my office."
"When the time is right."
"We are grateful to you."
"Did you call the police?"
"This is the only way."
"Put that on my tab."
"I was hoping you would come."
"Don't you have a cigarette?"
"I am at your command."
"I am at your service."
"I'll pass."
"What did you do with it?"
"I would like to say something."
"I'll try something."
"Attention all staff."
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
"This is my favorite song."
"I learned the lesson."
"I forgot my phone."
"That's just me."
"You didn't notice anything?"
"For me, it's the opposite."
"I have one last question."
"You can be sure of it."
"How did you meet him?"
"Just like that, all of a sudden?"
"I've said enough."
"Alright, I get it."
"Nice to see you."
"Yes, I heard that."
"Why did he say that?"
"Yes, I have to go."
"You should have seen this."
"No, it's fine, it's fine."
"It's a good school."
"What will become of him?"
"There's school tomorrow."
"I'll be right home."
"I want to call my lawyer."
"It works every time."
"Luckily I was there."
"Do you know where she lives?"
"Is that supposed to reassure me?"
"Because it's you."
"And how do you know that?"
"Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"I've heard stories."
"I trusted him."
"What a joy to see you."
"I know how it is."
"It's in their nature."
"That's an interesting idea."
"This is what I have."
"You shot me."
"What are you doing in there?"
"This must not happen."
"It's a good book."
"I won't call him."
"You are under no obligation to do so."
"Please, gentlemen."
"You have company."
"You are a good girl."
"Just do it."
"What was I supposed to do?"
"Someone has to go."
"I dreamed of you."
"You were very brave."
"That's really very kind."
"Have you seen my son?"
"Yes, I suspected that."
"His heart stopped."
"Which is the case."
"Just the two of us."
"He is in my room."
"I wasn't hiding."
"I'm doing you a favor."
"You've done enough."
"I invite you to dinner."
"You are a free man."
"I prefer not to say anything."
"Did he say why?"
"I told him everything."
"Whose is this?"
"Please, darling."
"Please, darling."
"How are you, big guy?"
"Maybe next year."
"What's his name again?"
"It's your turn now."
"I didn't believe it anymore."
"I owe him my life."
"I'm happy for you."
"How long have you been here?"
"Trust me a little."
"I have this for you."
"Is she always like this?"
"Let me do my job."
"Do you really want to go?"
"I'll take care of it now."
"We came for that."
"We all have a past."
"Up or down?"
"He's using you."
"A gift from my father."
"Sounds exciting."
"It's just a theory."
"You don't want it?"
"I like to believe so."
"I'll do it for you."
"Let him go."
"I'll take care of the rest."
"No, I have work."
"The result is the same."
"Do you know where he lives?"
"Are you going to hold out?"
"She is a beautiful woman."
"So what's the verdict?"
"He is a good man."
"You're doing whatever you want."
"I ask you the question."
"Not sure?"
"This is a delicate subject."
"We told each other everything."
"It's nice of you to stop by."
"She needs time."
"I'm going to the hotel."
"What do you say to that?"
"We have that in common."
"Let me introduce you to my wife."
"You're like a baby."
"I trusted you."
"I trusted you."
"It's really very good."
"You didn't notice anything?"
"Ah, is that it?"
"Please continue."
"Thank you for saving us."
"I know where he's going."
"Did you do something?"
"I suspected as much."
"Does this remind you of anyone?"
"Have you seen this girl?"
"I'm sorry about yesterday."
"You have to get out of here."
"But I'm still here."
"Nothing will happen to you."
"You heard very well."
"You need rest."
"Ask for what you want."
"Call me back as soon as possible."
"A life is at stake."
"But I want to."
"It's for the baby."
"Do you need money?"
"Do you live nearby?"
"I'm in love with you."
"Don't just stand there."
"You did very well."
"I can't say that."
"I am very happy about it."
"I'll call you when I arrive."
"I took the day off."
"If you want to."
"I'm in the area."
"Are you comfortable?"
"Are you comfortable?"
"He made his decision."
"But one thing is certain."
"Do you want some soup?"
"What do you remember?"
"I love you too, darling."
"I remember it now."
"This is what I believe."
"Can you turn up the volume?"
"You've come at the right time."
"Never heard of that."
"Maybe, I don't know."
"No, you won't go."
"Do you want to know?"
"Yes, that's her."
"Is this yours?"
"Does it have a name?"
"We took care of it."
"What other choice do we have?"
"It must be this way."
"Do you have another idea?"
"It's music."
"For real this time."
"I want more than that."
"I want to speak to the manager."
"I'll go get them."
"What will become of her?"
"This can't happen."
"Do you want some ice cream?"
"How did she take it?"
"What else do we have?"
"I want to say something."
"Thanks for noticing."
"You have a beautiful house."
"You're the one driving."
"I am a simple man."
"But I feel good."
"No one is safe."
"The exit is this way."
"Where is this noise coming from?"
"I've known this for a long time."
"All I can."
"I get paid for this."
"What will people say?"
"This is for my wife."
"I've known you forever."
"You should have called me."
"There is work to be done."
"Here we go, guys."
"Do you realize that?"
"I know everything about you."
"I have it right here."
"I am happy for you."
"I saw something."
"Can I get you a coffee?"
"I'll show you."
"I am very grateful to you."
"Give him some water."
"Give him water."
"You have beautiful hair."
"Can I count on you?"
"She didn't move."
"Give me another one."
"Give me another one."
"It didn't work."
"She is a beautiful girl."
"They are making fun of me."
"It started like this."
"There are so many."
"I would have remembered it."
"I go up to my room."
"How much did it cost you?"
"You've been had."
"It's part of the plan."
"Something happened to him."
"I didn't tell him."
"I just found it."
"I just got a call."
"More and more curious."
"Leave it, I'll do it."
"What is this game?"
"All I had."
"You should eat something."
"You can come with me."
"That's right, I forgot."
"How did she react?"
"A gift for the Gods."
"Merry Christmas to you too."
"Time will tell."
"I took a bullet."
"I was in the army."
"When did you see him?"
"Can I have a hug?"
"I'll meet you there."
"No, don't go."
"It's physics."
"Don't play that game."
"It's just a coincidence."
"This is the right place."
"You're the boss."
"We must continue to move forward."
"Who called the police?"
"I haven't started."
"We have to get used to it."
"You should go away."
"He needs time."
"You didn't see?"
"I don't need it."
"It won't."
"But where have you been?"
"Where did they take her?"
"One in a million chance."
"I should have married you."
"I have to take a shower."
"I need peace and quiet."
"You're going home."
"Do you want me to answer?"
"It's very hot here."
"Twenty years ago."
"That would be a good idea."
"I have to get out of here."
"We received a call."
"What did I do to you?"
"Do you want to play this?"
"That would be a good start."
"You're the spitting image of you."
"This is what I like."
"I'm on edge."
"You need to see a doctor."
"There is still much to do."
"I really want to."
"You always have been."
"Yeah, you could say that."
"You can come with us."
"I felt safe."
"How is he doing?"
"She told me about it."
"How are you tonight?"
"I underestimated you."
"I underestimated you."
"No, I'm not."
"It's the same person."
"Hence my presence here."
"I love you guys."
"Who was that on the phone?"
"Thanks for bringing it back."
"Just give me a minute."
"How did you find me?"
"How did you find me?"
"How did you find me?"
"What do you know about him?"
"It's a good investment."
"I count to ten."
"I want to know the truth."
"It was just a suggestion."
"The Lord is with you."
"That is my intention."
"My mouth is dry."
"That looks cool."
"I'll join you later."
"I'll see you there."
"Thank you for calling me."
"Can you be more specific?"
"It's a big responsibility."
"Nothing to do with you."
"How are you doing?"
"You have arrived at your destination."
"What do I say about it?"
"Have you seen his face?"
"You will be safe there."
"I've already taken some."
"Is there a message?"
"The kitchen is over there."
"I apologize to you."
"How long has it been?"
"How long has it been?"
"He is not normal."
"I didn't eat."
"Yes, yes, it's true."
"But it's a secret."
"What is the good news?"
"What are you doing up there?"
"It's more than that."
"I'll take one."
"I'll take one."
"How can they do that?"
"I saw you together."
"If I may."
"You are worth it."
"How many men do you have?"
"Are you coming?"
"Yes, it's mine."
"No, it doesn't work."
"I will stay with you."
"Because it's me."
"He's on the list."
"What am I to you?"
"Please come back."
"Do you want to add anything?"
"Where did they all go?"
"Put this on the table."
"Do you want another one?"
"Do you want another one?"
"This is the best way."
"I trust her."
"I'm going to have a drink."
"I need a change."
"I'm double-parked."
"Oh, I think so."
"No, he's mine."
"There is a witness."
"I knew your father."
"A friend of the family."
"We stick together."
"I thought you were asleep."
"People come and go."
"I deserved it."
"Have you heard about it?"
"I'm leaving too."
"What are we going to call it?"
"Thanks for thinking about it."
"I remember that."
"It's going to make some noise."
"Do you want something to drink?"
"Are you sure about that?"
"Don't look down."
"No, don't tell me anything."
"That's what matters."
"Go ahead, it's fine."
"Yet it is the truth."
"She wasn't."
"I want you to live."
"I don't think so."
"From start to finish."
"Are we going or what?"
"Thank you for your concern."
"It's over for him."
"Everything is in its place."
"This can't work."
"It's just a formality."
"We still have time."
"There will be consequences."
"Did you call the cops?"
"Who shot him?"
"No, you're not."
"Take him to the infirmary."
"My door is always open."
"How did it feel?"
"Where did you find it?"
"We will do our best."
"And how is it going?"
"This is the usual procedure."
"Nice to see you again."
"I'll take you there."
"Maybe we should go home."
"What are you still doing here?"
"You are the best."
"Can you believe it?"
"We have another one."
"We all have one."
"Did you come for that?"
"I wanted you to know."
"We are like brothers."
"I love you, my friend."
"We all have our secrets."
"This is the perfect place."
"I only have him."
"Did she say anything else?"
"It's a big country."
"No, I don't know anything."
"How long have you been together?"
"You have a lot of talent."
"You didn't know?"
"Yes, I saw them."
"What am I doing here?"
"You want me to go out?"
"It's the same guy."
"It was the right decision."
"It's my lucky charm."
"No need to apologize."
"You can go."
"I'll give you my number."
"One step at a time."
"One step at a time."
"That's a nice sum."
"In the dining room."
"I meant to."
"Where does that come from?"
"Look how beautiful it is."
"I'll call him later."
"He's a good guy."
"I want another one."
"You don't want to talk?"
"So what are we going to do?"
"I told them everything."
"I always liked it."
"Who are these people?"
"She's a nice girl."
"And there's more."
"A bet is a bet."
"It's all in the file."
"No, that's not enough."
"Have you been here before?"
"No, you don't have to."
"As long as it takes."
"As long as it takes."
"Is that your plan?"
"I expected that."
"I'm going to go to the bathroom."
"I'm going to pick up my son."
"How is this relevant?"
"How long have you been married?"
"We have an appointment."
"You know everyone."
"Glad you're here."
"What if I don't want to?"
"Actually, you know what?"
"No, I feel fine."
"It was enough to say it."
"You know how she is."
"Repeat, please."
"I've seen you before."
"It's a long journey."
"Sir, please."
"You came back for me."
"They are not there."
"No, we'll take care of it."
"I don't have any."
"That's my daughter."
"God told me."
"How did she do it?"
"Well, it's done."
"How do you feel now?"
"No, I'm fine here."
"Come let me kiss you."
"The sun is going to set."
"You do that very well."
"Can you come for a second?"
"This will take a minute."
"What are these clothes?"
"I can't, Mom."
"Have you been there yet?"
"Can someone explain to me?"
"No, he's not here."
"What if I was?"
"One step after another."
"You are a good dog."
"It's a public place."
"It scares me."
"Can I see your papers?"
"Can I have a towel?"
"Ups and downs."
"You have it in front of you."
"He's just a kid."
"Since when have you known?"
"How did you find it?"
"I'm in love with him."
"It's upstairs."
"What did they tell you?"
"What did they tell you?"
"I need them."
"I wanted to give this to you."
"It's silk."
"It was for your own good."
"And you, where are you going?"
"I'm going to try something."
"I'm moving on."
"I am her boyfriend."
"Are you even listening to me?"
"Go see who it is."
"Hey, I have an idea."
"You are on time."
"Like this, it's good."
"I wanted to say hello to you."
"That's just his style."
"Who did this to me?"
"I have enough to pay."
"How did I get here?"
"I tried once."
"Keep an eye on him."
"We have all the time in the world."
"That's politics."
"You're just in time."
"Who came up with the idea?"
"I could be like you."
"I saw pictures."
"Have you seen him recently?"
"Not much to say."
"How did you get this?"
"She is not pregnant."
"In the middle of the night?"
"And that's how it is."
"I had a perfect life."
"Can we talk later?"
"He was a good man."
"And what are you going to do?"
"I decided to stay."
"We'll take care of you."
"My name is Melinda Gordon."
"My name is Melinda Gordon."
"No, I'm sure of it."
"I never do that."
"All my best wishes for happiness."
"One day at a time."
"What would you do without me?"
"It seems to be working."
"He has always been there."
"I received a message."
"Are you happy with yourself?"
"Do you want some company?"
"What was he doing there?"
"Who told you that?"
"Leave it, I'll take care of it."
"I haven't decided anything."
"Just answer the question."
"It never ends."
"I remember very well."
"I didn't ask you anything."
"I want to go to the bathroom."
"I take responsibility for it."
"Maybe a little more."
"Do you want to come with me?"
"It's a good song."
"How is this done?"
"I wouldn't mind."
"It's a big change."
"We can do it together."
"I know who they are."
"They didn't come."
"Which side are you on?"
"I have one more question."
"This color suits you well."
"I need to breathe."
"But I'm here now."
"Quickly, please."
"I am who I am."
"Do you have experience?"
"The cream of the crop."
"I'll call you tomorrow morning."
"How is it different?"
"I was in love with her."
"Everyone loves me."
"I want to see my husband."
"We made a deal."
"I have another plan."
"Isn't she pretty?"
"It will do us good."
"It was a long day."
"You are with me now."
"Is everything okay with you?"
"It all happened so fast."
"Maybe it's you."
"Do you want to do me a favor?"
"What did she answer?"
"I told you."
"I told you so."
"I told you."
"This is an old photo."
"You didn't tell him anything?"
"Yes, I got it."
"It's a lot of pressure."
"And you, what do you do?"
"Did she tell you that?"
"Never heard of her."
"You are a smart girl."
"See you in class."
"Six years ago."
"Did she really say that?"
"Do you want to go somewhere?"
"No, you did the right thing."
"Do you want to have a coffee?"
"It never stops."
"You didn't come."
"You didn't come."
"Do you have any aspirin?"
"Let's do it and see later."
"For the good of all."
"She is not married."
"How can you think that?"
"It's like a drug."
"That's enough for me."
"Don't you want to go home?"
"It's your turn."
"Wait for me in the car."
"At least I tried."
"Son, do you have a name?"
"When I have time."
"And you want to know why?"
"You're scaring me."
"Do you have something to write with?"
"This is a great story."
"You can change your mind."
"He knows everyone."
"Have you been here long?"
"Have you made a decision?"
"I'll stay with her."
"You're a good guy."
"I'm not mean."
"I heard his voice."
"And she did."
"I can still fix that."
"That's the truth."
"I got your text."
"And you, who are you?"
"Sorry to have woken you up."
"Have you been doing this for a long time?"
"Whatever it takes."
"I loved this movie."
"She has a boyfriend."
"I like being here."
"If necessary, yes."
"I had to tell you."
"Who told him that?"
"There is a mole."
"She has always been there."
"What is this due to?"
"It's an urban legend."
"Can you give us a minute?"
"I was wondering."
"What are friends for?"
"It may take a while."
"I'm happy for you."
"No last name."
"Do you want to be a hero?"
"Do you know anything about it?"
"I think you know."
"There is a girl."
"I'm all yours."
"I got used to it."
"This is a wonderful idea."
"He's just waiting for that."
"This is a personal question."
"I don't say anything anymore."
"You deserve to be happy."
"Can we take a picture?"
"Where did you find them?"
"Go ahead if you want."
"I need privacy."
"What are you here for?"
"It still is."
"This is big news."
"I'll get you out of here."
"He is a good friend."
"What was the question?"
"I'm on a track."
"I'll be around."
"It might be useful to us."
"And what did you say?"
"Okay, whatever you want."
"I have company."
"Which side are you on?"
"How did it end?"
"What else do you want?"
"This name is familiar to me."
"How did you come here?"
"I had never noticed."
"You took your time."
"Do you want me to try?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, your attention."
"Is that your real name?"
"I win."
"But what can I do?"
"See you at work."
"We will go all the way."
"I care about you."
"Look what I have."
"I think that's enough."
"She doesn't like him."
"I've known you for a long time."
"It's self-evident."
"I'm going to walk home."
"I took notes."
"I love you, my brother."
"Is that your idea?"
"I need a taxi."
"That's what she's here for."
"I'll be there in a few minutes."
"We're done here."
"So, where are we?"
"What's the name?"
"You took your time."
"Is it?"
"Get her out of here."
"I am always with you."
"It's really very beautiful."
"I'm willing to believe you."
"I want you to stay."
"You look like your father."
"Order whatever you want."
"I made some tea."
"I care about you very much."
"It's an interesting story."
"I can do that."
"I said maybe."
"You were very kind."
"I reserved a table."
"I don't have a plan."
"Is that your name?"
"It's a new day."
"There is change."
"How are you, brother?"
"The party is in full swing."
"I just got up."
"Who is he talking to?"
"You know me so well."
"I just got back."
"No need to say it."
"I'll do some research."
"Your father wants to see you."
"What do you think about this?"
"I know who she is."
"You have my full attention."
"This is the hardest part."
"Do you live nearby?"
"Try to get some sleep."
"I'll give it to you."
"I gave it to him."
"You know very well that it is."
"What's got into you?"
"This is probably true."
"I have to find my son."
"I am a happy man."
"I'd like a drink."
"Because you know what?"
"Give him my regards."
"Who else is here?"
"You are doing a good job."
"You are doing a good job."
"What's missing?"
"I absolutely have to talk to him."
"Well, you know what?"
"So I did it."
"It's a nice place."
"One after the other."
"And what if it's not?"
"I am not God."
"I'll let you get to know each other."
"They shot me."
"That's a surprise."
"Have you thought about that?"
"He is retired."
"Aren't you introducing me?"
"My patience is running out."
"It just went away."
"Did you bring him here?"
"I took a walk."
"I have a better question."
"I'm taking him with me."
"Call me on my mobile."
"Can you do something?"
"I have to be sure."
"Where does this music come from?"
"Where does all this come from?"
"It suits you very well."
"I want to be with you."
"Where is your boyfriend?"
"Did you see it well?"
"I thought you knew."
"I'm here, with you."
"Are you telling me that now?"
"Please come."
"I must have misheard."
"Go brush your teeth."
"I'm with you now."
"And what are you doing here?"
"Keep an eye on her."
"No, I don't like it."
"I'll be right behind you."
"I have to leave town."
"I didn't drink."
"This is the real world."
"What should I do with it?"
"He's a great guy."
"He's a great guy."
"You better go home."
"He was a good friend."
"Yes, you must be right."
"What do you mean you can't?"
"Did you do it?"
"Dad is home."
"You should have thought of that before."
"I'm proud of her."
"You will come with me."
"I had to know."
"He's the boss."
"Just a little bit."
"Have you known him for a long time?"
"I don't go out much."
"I'll get the doctor."
"How would I have known?"
"No, don't be."
"I am in a good mood."
"I heard that."
"It wasn't intentional."
"Do you think you can do it?"
"Do you remember us?"
"It's important to you."
"Did you find something?"
"I've seen them before."
"Do you want to go home?"
"You can't say that."
"Are you dating someone?"
"You helped me a lot."
"I have to make a report."
"Yeah, you did it."
"You have a big mouth."
"And you, are you well?"
"Do you want to tell me?"
"He is in the house."
"Where did he go?"
"Why are you coming home so early?"
"There are five of them."
"Very well, in that case."
"What have you done now?"
"Can I have some more?"
"She's right, you know."
"Shall we talk about something else?"
"Take a leaf out of their book."
"You must be very proud."
"You're lucky."
"How could you know?"
"Do you want to know something else?"
"In the conference room."
"I brought food."
"Please stay."
"Please stay."
"What are you doing at my house?"
"I'd love a coffee."
"I need exercise."
"Were there people there?"
"Can you hold this for me?"
"Did they let you out?"
"I'll go there myself."
"Please, madam."
"No, isn't it?"
"I checked three times."
"It's a good deal."
"Please listen."
"Make room for me."
"You're shaking like a leaf."
"He's just a kid."
"Let us do our job."
"It was my first time."
"I am a police inspector."
"Does it work?"
"He went that way."
"I'm overjoyed."
"What are you doing in there?"
"Where did you get that from?"
"But what is he talking about?"
"I just wanted to talk to you."
"They are ready for anything."
"I want to be like you."
"I left messages."
"I'm going to a party."
"It's a beautiful car."
"Nice to see you."
"I should have listened to him."
"Maybe so."
"Does that suit you?"
"He is a wonderful man."
"It's just us."
"It's important to us."
"What is your name, sir?"
"Just give me a minute."
"I don't recognize her."
"I'll take you there."
"I want to walk."
"Do you think I should?"
"They trust me."
"By any means."
"Where were you this morning?"
"Will you do this for me?"
"Do you want to know the truth?"
"I need proof."
"She's talking nonsense."
"What a small world it is."
"Can I talk to you frankly?"
"What is it for?"
"Where did it happen?"
"You can come to my house."
"What do you know about me?"
"Not because of me."
"I'm not there anymore."
"I can prove it to you."
"Can I come to your house?"
"Nice to meet you."
"It's a little better."
"Because I was there."
"It's drugs."
"Who do you think you're talking to?"
"Thank you both."
"Are you going to tell him?"
"I saw the photo."
"You said that."
"I'll get one."
"Glad you're here."
"This is what happened."
"I prefer not to talk about it."
"I saw it clearly."
"It's okay, calm down."
"Who let you in?"
"I have appointments."
"I'm going to pick up the children."
"How much do you need?"
"Is it morning already?"
"There will be an investigation."
"I feel lucky."
"I have a quick question."
"Most of the time, yes."
"I read your articles."
"I have to talk to him."
"That's kind of you."
"What's gotten into him?"
"Are you in love with him?"
"And who is he?"
"Oh, what's that?"
"This is a legitimate question."
"I always wanted to try."
"Thank you for being with us."
"Where did you meet her?"
"I have to get out of here."
"It's all yours."
"You didn't ask."
"No, I want to do it."
"Are you giving me orders?"
"I have a question."
"Eight years ago."
"We had a lot of fun."
"They're making fun of us."
"How are you going to do that?"
"It was a foregone conclusion."
"I have other plans."
"I am comfortable."
"It helps me think."
"Around the corner."
"I would like to go home."
"Use your imagination."
"What if he does?"
"It's a good job."
"Tell me about your father."
"You don't know that."
"It's okay, my baby."
"I'm going fishing."
"I am a good person."
"I could have stopped him."
"Tell him to call me."
"You are not him."
"I'd love to do her."
"I found something else."
"I should have guessed."
"I wish you would leave."
"You know where to find us."
"You know where to find us."
"And what do I tell him?"
"Those were the good old days."
"Yes, yes, I'm fine."
"Are you getting involved too?"
"I agree with you."
"He reminds me of someone."
"Did you call the cops?"
"You look happy."
"Some more tea?"
"It reminds me of my childhood."
"Can we trust him?"
"You are doing your best."
"I knew you would like it."
"Where did they go?"
"She came to me."
"Yes, of course yes."
"The door is always open."
"That's a good answer."
"It's our only option."
"I took pictures."
"Why is it always me?"
"How could she?"
"What's up, brother?"
"I got a call."
"Do as you please."
"It has value."
"What is this song?"
"How could I forget?"
"Where are we going to go?"
"Are you sure?"
"She is in the bedroom."
"No, it's yours."
"It's just a job."
"I was going to tell you about it."
"I love you so much."
"What did you tell them?"
"I will speak to you frankly."
"I need to go out."
"Don't answer the phone."
"It's just a story."
"It's his whole life."
"How long have I been here?"
"Let's not talk about it now."
"And I like it."
"Not in that sense."
"Do you want to try your luck?"
"Do you want some soup?"
"How did you find it?"
"I've already said everything."
"It didn't happen."
"I'm here on business."
"I'm here on business."
"What do you want to do with it?"
"Someone took it."
"I told you about it."
"You have a lot in common."
"What are you going to tell them?"
"What are you going to tell them?"
"You are a free man."
"Are you from the police?"
"Because I like it."
"We have made a decision."
"Everyone knows her."
"But it will get better."
"Is there anything else I can do?"
"Have a great weekend."
"No, it's not over."
"What are you trying to do?"
"You have to have faith."
"Sorry, that's just how it is."
"Please continue."
"Shall I bring you something?"
"I heard them talking."
"Can you keep a secret?"
"What can I tell you?"
"Are you on the list?"
"This cannot be."
"It's the right size."
"I thought I did it."
"Oh, I'm sure."
"I'll go there."
"It's a good name."
"I've waited so long."
"I know where he lives."
"Now, please."
"My God, you're right."
"I was just thinking about you."
"We have to go get him."
"Yes, I found it."
"You know it as well as I do."
"It's my turn now."
"Yes, we can say that."
"Or maybe not."
"I have beer."
"I'm not interested anymore."
"There is a door."
"I can see it from here."
"Can I get you a drink?"
"So, what do you think?"
"She needed me."
"Is this humor?"
"Just a glass of water."
"No, I'm doing very well."
"What else do you know?"
"How long does it last?"
"I brought this for you."
"Do you have another one?"
"We'll do that later."
"Thank you for taking me."
"Are you having a good evening?"
"What are we eating tonight?"
"Where did they send you?"
"Why are you still here?"
"What will become of us?"
"It's nice of you to come."
"You are a human being."
"What a pleasure to see you again."
"I really need to talk to him."
"I know where to find her."
"Put it back in its place."
"Good work, everyone."
"But what should I do?"
"It's against my principles."
"Keep an eye on him."
"Are you free tonight?"
"They are on the roof."
"Do you want to race?"
"You've done enough."
"Why did you marry him?"
"I have more money."
"I have to go to work."
"Don't be in such a hurry."
"Do you go to church?"
"And how do I do that?"
"It's afternoon."
"He deserved it."
"No, I'm not leaving."
"It keeps me awake."
"Of course, I know that."
"She's not there anymore."
"There is evidence."
"Yes, how do you know?"
"Can I say one thing?"
"Close the door on your way out."
"A bullet in the chest."
"Nice to see you."
"I am a new man."
"What did he do to you?"
"You look great."
"What do you want from us?"
"It's them or us."
"I am needed."
"He has a girlfriend."
"I'll take care of it, boss."
"You'll never see her again."
"She hasn't disappeared."
"And what is his name?"
"Does this remind you of anyone?"
"Something very important."
"No, it was my idea."
"Something happened."
"It didn't last."
"And where is he now?"
"It's fine like that."
"Who told you that?"
"I'm a good guy."
"Why are you so interested?"
"He's hiding something from us."
"How can you not be?"
"What are you going to call him?"
"Few people know this."
"How dare you come here?"
"And what do you think about it?"
"I'll get some beers."
"What are you doing tomorrow night?"
"Who's at the door?"
"We did our job."
"She couldn't."
"You are not anymore."
"I read the newspapers."
"I have big news."
"I'll take the stairs."
"It was a beautiful day."
"You must know something."
"No, I don't want anything."
"Can't wait?"
"It's different this time."
"He left the city."
"Whatever you want."
"We can do that here."
"I can take you there."
"I can take you there."
"I should probably go."
"I want to make love."
"The best is yet to come."
"You did very well."
"Do you know where you are?"
"I changed my name."
"Where did you put it?"
"I like this idea."
"It's to protect me."
"I'm all yours."
"That's what it's made for."
"I learned something."
"You are a nice girl."
"Come on, I'll introduce you."
"What's his number?"
"I'm coming right now."
"I only love you."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Sorry, but it's true."
"Don't you have class?"
"I'm not far away."
"What do you say to that?"
"I owe you that."
"It will take your mind off things."
"Are you having a good time?"
"Let me go."
"When did you learn it?"
"I'll be up in a minute."
"And what did you find?"
"I have to find someone."
"Don't call me that."
"Do you have anything else?"
"Do you really want to do this?"
"You know very well why."
"There is a snag."
"Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"It's a beautiful song."
"You pay."
"You're not married?"
"I need light."
"I'll explain to you on the way."
"Have you been together for a long time?"
"Have you seen this woman?"
"How long have you been working here?"
"What else do we have?"
"Wait, I have an idea."
"This is the first step."
"What is he here for?"
"Well, that's great."
"It's a big decision."
"I'm going out to get some fresh air."
"I know exactly what to do."
"Yes, it's mine."
"Calm down, it'll be okay."
"I'll go too."
"I always wanted it."
"All my best wishes for happiness."
"So there are two of us."
"She's upstairs."
"I need a cigarette."
"Oh, I think so."
"It will do for now."
"It's a lot of work."
"I am with friends."
"Who did you talk to?"
"I have a better one."
"Too good to be true."
"I don't know anything about it yet."
"So where was I?"
"I know him very well."
"I take my hat off to you."
"Is it time already?"
"What you said."
"They are lucky."
"Nobody can do anything about it."
"Yes, it is one."
"He is more than that."
"What do we do with him?"
"It happened here."
"You can't imagine."
"I always keep my promises."
"You have to get out of there."
"So we're even."
"I'm beside myself."
"That's enough for me."
"What are you doing?"
"I'm going shopping."
"I was just doing my job."
"You heard me correctly."
"I'll give you a chance."
"I'll give you a chance."
"I was in love with him."
"I was very clear."
"I'll give it a try."
"I'm on the way."
"Why did you do that?"
"So what does that mean?"
"He is in perfect health."
"Can I leave a message?"
"It could have been you."
"I promised him."
"I spoke to him yesterday."
"Have you seen my father?"
"They have no proof."
"I love you too, darling."
"What are we doing tonight?"
"Where there's a will, there's a way."
"Put it in the car."
"I'll stand guard."
"The doctor will see you."
"Are you ready for this?"
"But you can't."
"I need the phone."
"You ask a lot of questions."
"You ask a lot of questions."
"You work all the time."
"We have to turn around."
"I'll use it."
"I'll be back in two hours."
"I saw it coming."
"That's you, really."
"Let's see what happens."
"Nobody's going anywhere."
"Do you want to come with us?"
"You had to tell me about it."
"Can't you hear me?"
"I come to say goodbye to you."
"It's a real maze."
"Ten minutes ago."
"It's Spanish."
"I must know the truth."
"God is my witness."
"I told them."
"I should go talk to him."
"Dad, this is for you."
"We are moving forward."
"I have one too."
"Close the door behind you."
"I know, I heard."
"I'm going to the kitchen."
"I just want to get it over with."
"Do you want us to leave?"
"Maybe next week."
"There are four of them."
"I know how it works."
"It was important to me."
"Patience is a virtue."
"You taught me that."
"I'm the one leaving."
"What did you have in mind?"
"She doesn't work here anymore."
"You are making the right choice."
"I need coffee."
"And what about you?"
"I don't live here."
"Did you take anything?"
"What does this mean?"
"Yes, that's an idea."
"I'd rather not know."
"Do you have any beer?"
"Do you have any beer?"
"Nice to meet you."
"What does that mean, exactly?"
"You know the funniest thing?"
"Two birds with one stone."
"Nobody knows anything about it."
"Dad, what are you doing here?"
"Yeah, that must be it."
"It's going to cost you dearly."
"Sorry, we're late."
"Whose house is this?"
"Please come."
"I'm going to put an end to it."
"He is in my office."
"I'm on parole."
"How can you say that?"
"How can you say that?"
"What is the goal?"
"It's a good day."
"Thanks for the other day."
"Thank you very much for your time."
"He just arrived."
"Nothing is more important."
"This is my home too."
"Glad you're here."
"You should be too."
"I have to call the police."
"It is at your disposal."
"And you believed her?"
"Where is the commanding officer?"
"I'm making something for you."
"I don't know what to think."
"How long have you lived here?"
"I never asked."
"Call me when you get home."
"Can you give me a minute?"
"She arrived this morning."
"Isn't he cute?"
"How did you find me?"
"How did you find me?"
"I want you inside me."
"Nice to see you again."
"How long have you known him?"
"How long have you known him?"
"It's a day of celebration."
"I forgot my cell phone."
"I'll call the police."
"Do you play guitar?"
"I have a personal question."
"I don't speak French."
"We'll take you home."
"The boss wants to see you."
"It will do him good."
"She's not interested."
"You have the right to do so."
"Thank God it's you."
"Where did they all go?"
"It's a real pleasure."
"Dad, I have to go."
"There is a passage."
"How did you get here?"
"Do you have money?"
"You could come with me."
"I want to do something."
"He is white as snow."
"My car is right there."
"Something is happening to me."
"Isn't she gorgeous?"
"Maybe she was right."
"Do you know who this is?"
"There is a man."
"Yes, it's going very well."
"Do you know who he is?"
"Say it's Vincent."
"Because I'm here."
"You talked about me?"
"It looks fantastic."
"She didn't come back."
"You never will be."
"What am I to you?"
"If I tell you."
"How long have you been doing this?"
"I really liked it."
"That's good, big guy."
"And you always will be."
"Don't you read the newspapers?"
"It is not available."
"You made a choice."
"Yet this is the case."
"I received orders."
"I didn't notice."
"No, it's not going to work."
"Tell me where they are."
"And that's a good thing."
"What's her name again?"
"Is it going as you want?"
"You're a good kid."
"We've known each other forever."
"Everything will go very well."
"Would you mind explaining to me?"
"I don't recognize myself anymore."
"Yes, everything is going very well."
"I'll tell them."
"No, don't say that."
"Not all at the same time."
"Would you like some water?"
"You need to get out."
"Well, that's all."
"I am your big brother."
"Who will pay for this?"
"You should come with me."
"That's an interesting question."
"What are you going to do to me?"
"Charming, isn't it?"
"If you're there, pick up."
"Do you want some breakfast?"
"I learned from the best."
"It's in a week."
"I'm in the know."
"And you, what are you?"
"Thank you for joining me."
"This is my home."
"I'll buy you a beer."
"In a quarter of an hour."
"It's his first time."
"It's a good exercise."
"I'll be back in two minutes."
"Isn't she wonderful?"
"Don't you want to?"
"I have all night."
"Good luck for the future."
"I haven't seen any."
"Let's see what you're worth."
"I'll tell him myself."
"Let me go home."
"That's good, my son."
"We have to find something else."
"And me, who am I?"
"It's a beautiful day."
"This is the only option."
"What is the magic word?"
"You know very well that it does."
"I hope you come."
"Can you open the door?"
"So what did you do?"
"I know you understand."
"I know you understand."
"Oh, how cute."
"It's for school."
"Why did she say that?"
"It's food."
"I would never do that."
"I will take care of her."
"Everything will be fine, you'll see."
"Did he tell you about it?"
"That's good, guys."
"On tiptoe."
"It's in our nature."
"I'll go see that."
"If one can say so."
"He is a charming man."
"Do you feel better now?"
"There is work to be done."
"No, it's the other way around."
"Do you need anything else?"
"I will never do it."
"We really have to go."
"You dropped that."
"Dad, can I talk to you?"
"Where did you get that?"
"Where did you get that?"
"And I need it."
"I want you to come home."
"What is the name of this place?"
"If it can help you."
"No, but I would like to."
"You don't remember?"
"I like it like that."
"I did my research."
"I have a new job."
"We are all with you."
"I gave it to him."
"What are you doing on the floor?"
"You are a good friend."
"You are a true friend."
"I'll show you the way."
"Do you have better things to do?"
"How are you, friend?"
"Would you do me a favor?"
"Since I'm telling you."
"You never know."
"In a day or two."
"Do you want me to come?"
"And there is this."
"We are like a family."
"Do you want to be my friend?"
"Yes, I love you too."
"Have you made your choice?"
"I'll sort this all out."
"I never thought about it."
"I saw you do it."
"Who would do something like that?"
"Who would do such a thing?"
"Did he do something?"
"It was a great idea."
"Nice to meet you, sir."
"You don't know?"
"I need cash."
"I told you no."
"It suits you very well."
"Congratulations are in order."
"What am I going to tell them?"
"Well, that's perfect."
"That's quite a coincidence."
"We will be safe there."
"Arms in the air."
"Sorry about the other day."
"Call me whenever you want."
"What do you think of her?"
"It's like a game."
"They never came back."
"Mom, what are you doing here?"
"I took a picture."
"I want you to know."
"He's a nice guy."
"You don't do it."
"This is an excellent choice."
"I'm not mean."
"Do you want to leave a message?"
"I really like it."
"I return the compliment."
"Yes, from time to time."
"You are in great shape."
"At least, I thought so."
"You're going to have a baby."
"He's a beautiful baby."
"Ask anyone."
"You must come."
"Put it on the table."
"That's what marriage is."
"It's over for me."
"We're having a good time."
"He is in the office."
"Because I'm black?"
"I brought something."
"It just came like that."
"Have you been to war?"
"That's just how it is."
"He is a good father."
"At any cost."
"You are a lucky man."
"You look surprised."
"You look surprised."
"Nobody asks you."
"Nice to meet you."
"I'll call you later."
"This is a good start."
"You were very kind."
"His heart stopped."
"You don't want this."
"I read the newspaper."
"Did they say something?"
"I saw a man."
"What do you know about him?"
"But what were you thinking?"
"Just give me a second."
"What do you do with that?"
"Let's see what you have."
"She is not human."
"What did you think about it?"
"Do you have any idea?"
"So how are you feeling?"
"Are you high or what?"
"Come on, please."
"Come, please."
"I would like to see that."
"It just happens."
"I'm glad to be leaving."
"I did my research."
"Don't be a baby."
"You don't want it?"
"No, I prefer not to."
"We are safe."
"It's in your head."
"I'm on a date."
"Come in and close the door."
"Only time will tell."
"What does she look like?"
"Can I have one?"
"Can I take a ride?"
"I needed to talk."
"He's making fun of you."
"I love everyone."
"I have more questions."
"It's not pretty."
"Are you thinking of someone?"
"He seemed nice."
"What you did."
"Who wouldn't?"
"Look at yourself in the mirror."
"It's a lovely place."
"I'm going to make some calls."
"No, I have to do it."
"We have to give it a try."
"This is my favorite part."
"I forgot the rest."
"Maybe you were right."
"She was a good woman."
"Would you mind following me?"
"No time to talk."
"No, I'm late."
"What's going to happen?"
"You knew this would happen."
"Supply and demand."
"I need to get some fresh air."
"I don't think anything about it."
"It's our little secret."
"Is this your boyfriend?"
"I have every right."
"Is it already that late?"
"Have you ever seen any?"
"I did my best."
"Will you marry me?"
"We can give it a try."
"It's just a game."
"You owe me an apology."
"She doesn't think so."
"It's just a phase."
"Do you know how much it's worth?"
"I forgot my key."
"It is a wise decision."
"Do you have a boyfriend?"
"Reinforcements are on the way."
"It never happened to me."
"I just called him."
"It's payday."
"You're a good cop."
"What's the address?"
"I count on your discretion."
"I never liked him."
"Where did you find that?"
"I should call the police."
"It's in the manual."
"Don't you want to play?"
"So what are you doing here?"
"What does he think about it?"
"Do you know who you are?"
"This is a good omen."
"What is this disguise?"
"I saw the future."
"Yeah, I saw it."
"Four days ago."
"I'm going this way."
"Open the outer door, Hal."
"You have to let her go."
"Use your head."
"Okay, whose turn is it?"
"You don't have it?"
"I'll take you home."
"That's something else."
"No, it's not cool."
"There were two of them."
"What did I tell you?"
"What did I tell you?"
"What did I tell you?"
"How long are you staying?"
"How long are you staying?"
"I'll get the key."
"It's a beautiful piece."
"You're out of the woods."
"I'm right, aren't I?"
"And now what do we do?"
"You can trust him."
"Didn't he tell you anything?"
"I have a lot of work."
"I want to make up for it."
"I would never do it."
"Can I borrow this?"
"Do you want to go out?"
"The right age."
"It was on TV."
"Go wait in the car."
"He's from the CIA."
"Tell us where he is."
"I had to do it."
"I've known her forever."
"She left the hotel."
"He tells me something."
"We need to talk."
"You have to get out of here."
"I have something here."
"I need a volunteer."
"You took your time."
"We owe him that."
"Was it good last night?"
"I can't imagine."
"No, it's not you."
"It needs to be taken care of."
"I hope that will be enough."
"Oh yeah, I forgot."
"It was a beautiful ceremony."
"It was luck."
"I asked first."
"Take me home."
"They are in the area."
"It's a bit long."
"Everything is back to normal."
"She didn't have any."
"I needed to think."
"I'm done here."
"Do you want to take care of it?"
"He is in the building."
"Who would have guessed?"
"They are capable of anything."
"This is how it goes."
"I owe you an explanation."
"We need proof."
"Could you be more specific?"
"Do you think you're at home?"
"I'll take care of it, darling."
"Nice talking to you."
"Have you heard anything?"
"It's mine."
"Mind your own business."
"It's good for her."
"I will always remember it."
"We'll see each other later."
"I'll do it for you."
"You wouldn't."
"He is a remarkable man."
"One last one for the road?"
"We are at the hospital."
"When did I say that?"
"It looks like he's sleeping."
"You did your best."
"Please sign here."
"You are full of surprises."
"You have to come back."
"I am grateful to you."
"It's a comedy."
"Where are you going with this?"
"Thank you for asking me."
"One of them."
"I'm his girlfriend."
"I went to see her."
"Come back, please."
"You told us."
"I found a job."
"I have to go get her."
"We'll remember later."
"I want to go with you."
"I want to go with you."
"Are you in the know?"
"Can you keep a secret?"
"When will this end?"
"I'm doing my best."
"And I saw it."
"What's wrong with your face?"
"I'll see you tomorrow morning."
"Face the facts."
"Same as him."
"What is this bag?"
"Who did you talk to?"
"Do you know where you're going?"
"Age before beauty."
"She left town."
"Do you think this will work?"
"You can tell me about it."
"You didn't notice?"
"Did you leave a message?"
"Do you have any other questions?"
"Because you are here."
"You're good at this."
"You have beautiful hair."
"I saw it."
"No, I like it."
"What do you think of me?"
"How are we going to find him?"
"Because I loved him."
"You are a smart boy."
"Let's go, kids."
"This is a brilliant idea."
"No, I've had enough."
"The Lord is my shepherd."
"You will never find her."
"He volunteered."
"I have good reasons."
"It makes perfect sense."
"Take care of your mother."
"I will be by your side."
"No, I don't see anything."
"I'm not a kid."
"I like helping people."
"I wanted to thank you."
"You still don't understand."
"It's common sense."
"I don't accept that."
"The target is in sight."
"He's still a child."
"Where did you get them?"
"I'll go first."
"Don't get too excited."
"You will need me."
"You have a beautiful voice."
"Take me in his place."
"It's curfew."
"It's your turn now."
"I'm going to get a doctor."
"You are an intelligent man."
"No, I'm not going."
"Did he find something?"
"It's a nice gesture."
"You are not human."
"She wants to take my place."
"Is it that bad?"
"I took a shower."
"I am an old friend."
"I'm a good girl."
"You won't be."
"I live right next door."
"I have made my arrangements."
"I already know."
"What do you want to do now?"
"Nobody touched it."
"It's getting dark."
"What do you want?"
"What do you want?"
"And you, what do you want?"
"She can't speak."
"And you, who are you?"
"It's halftime."
"He crossed the line."
"I want to make myself useful."
"Close the door when you leave."
"We're leaving in an hour."
"No, don't apologize."
"It must make sense."
"It's a wonderful place."
"You're a little late."
"I need space."
"I knew he would come back."
"I finished my shift."
"Yeah, I got it."
"We'll take care of it."
"What do you think, doctor?"
"I would like to know."
"You have to be sure."
"She is a wonderful woman."
"I left a note."
"You have blue eyes."
"Who taught you that?"
"I have a new plan."
"No, I'm not."
"I need a car."
"Are you from the CIA?"
"I'll get you some."
"We are happy for you."
"Tomorrow is my birthday."
"Where were you last night?"
"It's a big fish."
"Someone wants to talk to you."
"It's Valentine's Day."
"I should go too."
"Did you make love?"
"Can I trust you?"
"I'm putting you on hold."
"Do you have an appointment?"
"How do you know about this?"
"I know how to do it."
"I have crossed the line."
"No, that's not fair."
"Well, you know what?"
"I take care of myself."
"She came to my house."
"It was a simple question."
"She shouldn't have."
"You did it well."
"I took the test."
"It's a good car."
"Do you see what's happening?"
"It's for the family."
"You know how I am."
"How did you find me?"
"Here is what I propose."
"Because I am."
"I thought you were my friend."
"We'll find a way."
"It's in the trunk."
"How are you sure?"
"How are you sure?"
"What do we know about him?"
"You have no messages."
"We had an argument."
"I saw him leave."
"But I'll tell you."
"Choose what you want."
"I have to go see her."
"This is an important step."
"Thank you for trusting me."
"There is a change."
"Can I have a cigarette?"
"In the blink of an eye."
"I misjudged you."
"It's just a party."
"I stopped counting."
"Have you met someone?"
"You were never there."
"Wait, what are you talking about?"
"We'll see each other tonight."
"No, it wasn't me."
"Ask for whatever you want."
"You will thank me one day."
"You are free to go."
"It came by itself."
"It needs a name."
"They took everything from me."
"Don't say another word."
"No, it's not necessary."
"I see who it is."
"I have some."
"Who sent you here?"
"Or someone else."
"We will do everything possible."
"I was just doing my job."
"There's nothing at all."
"At least for now."
"What did he write?"
"There is an intruder."
"My father taught me."
"I have one left."
"You didn't see me."
"She never came home."
"It's really very simple."
"Things are different now."
"So they say."
"We'll talk about it again tomorrow morning."
"Maybe I should have."
"What did you give him?"
"It's observation."
"He's my brother-in-law."
"This is a great plan."
"I want water."
"Was I not clear?"
"You heard the lady."
"I'll be back soon."
"Everything ended well."
"I'm going to set the table."
"Have you seen the video?"
"You may know him."
"You're going to have fun."
"He is at school."
"I'll come get you."
"I brought this back for you."
"I've always liked you."
"Please come back."
"Like two drops of water."
"Something like that."
"I will never know."
"Something stronger?"
"You can trust us."
"What do you have to say?"
"He was my mother's."
"Come join us."
"Where did you meet her?"
"Where did you meet her?"
"Why are you still here?"
"I leave the choice to you."
"The Force is with me."
"He was a good soldier."
"He doesn't work here anymore."
"She doesn't wake up."
"Nothing to do with us."
"I read your book."
"It's a beautiful city."
"There is turbulence."
"You look better."
"Why do you always do this?"
"This is one of mine."
"It's in the head."
"Were you going to tell me?"
"How much do you need?"
"How much do you need?"
"And the day after."
"You are not pregnant."
"I want to see the body."
"So we agree."
"Did you get my message?"
"You owe me a beer."
"I grew up with him."
"You can count on that."
"I'm going to call someone."
"But there is more."
"I saw my mother."
"I've never met him."
"I'm a good guy."
"I'll spare you the details."
"As I did."
"Don't you want to come in?"
"Do you have any coke?"
"What do we do with her?"
"Thank you, that's very kind."
"You are still so beautiful."
"I think it's very good."
"A little fresh air."
"It's good for him."
"For me, it is."
"Can you live with that?"
"It's more like that."
"I wanted to hear your voice."
"What are you still doing here?"
"He is in good health."
"One good thing done."
"Now, please."
"Not at all, actually."
"I must speak to him immediately."
"She deserves better than this."
"Why did you come here?"
"It will soon be daylight."
"Are you sure you're okay?"
"What are you dressed as?"
"You have nice eyes."
"Honey, please."
"You have crossed the line."
"I called the hospital."
"There is still time."
"You need to eat something."
"May they rest in peace."
"Look who's back."
"It's for good."
"Now it's your turn."
"At least we're together."
"He comes home."
"Are you still here?"
"You have become a man."
"She's all yours."
"It's for your safety."
"What must happen will happen."
"I'll try something else."
"I'll take this one."
"Can we go faster?"
"You are our only hope."
"You really did it."
"No, she can't."
"She did it on purpose."
"Do you want to take a shower?"
"No, I'm not well."
"All means are good."
"No one will see the difference."
"That's all, I think."
"Everyone will know."
"Which side are you on?"
"Which side are you on?"
"What did you call me?"
"She tells me something."
"You get straight to the point."
"I want to be your friend."
"Put that on my account."
"We're going to go around."
"Very well, I will."
"He is a good doctor."
"What's the program?"
"I just wanted to let you know."
"She's still a child."
"And I know about it."
"One of two things."
"She never came."
"As if you care."
"Why do you want to do this?"
"I want to go out."
"I called twice."
"Can't you hear it?"
"It was a good job."
"Nobody knew."
"You don't have them."
"I'm on the list."
"He needs to know."
"No, I'm not coming."
"I will remember you."
"I'll be there in five minutes."
"One thing after another."
"Once and for all."
"Yes, and you know what?"
"There was something else."
"You have a lot to learn."
"But how is this possible?"
"Everything will go as planned."
"I need to drink."
"Do you have better things to do?"
"But you already know that."
"They don't know anything about it."
"He was a nice boy."
"How do you know all this?"
"Did he do it?"
"Have you read the newspaper?"
"Dinner will be ready soon."
"What do you want to do with it?"
"And I believed it."
"I will take care of you."
"I'll be back in ten minutes."
"You asked me."
"What are you doing there?"
"He is like his father."
"Who shot me?"
"I've already thought about it."
"You owe him that."
"Take the time to live."
"I'll wait a bit."
"Is this supposed to be me?"
"What's yours?"
"The Lord be with you."
"It would do me good."
"Please leave us."
"I'm going to the grocery store."
"Say 'please'."
"I love you, my heart."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"What's the point of that?"
"It's a nice house."
"Maybe he was right."
"It's more than likely."
"This is mine."
"Does she have family?"
"He is a good person."
"It's clear and straightforward."
"It feels really good."
"Nice to see you."
"Nice to see you."
"Things will get better."
"It always ends like this."
"It made me laugh."
"I say goodbye to you."
"I'll fix that for you."
"I'm going to take a nap."
"It was a good evening."
"I remember it."
"It's in your best interest."
"What is she doing there?"
"I remember you."
"She gave it to me."
"I didn't choose."
"I'm on the train."
"What is this guy?"
"You didn't ask?"
"You won't believe it."
"I will need you."
"Is this your boyfriend?"
"She is in love with you."
"You are welcome, gentlemen."
"I heard about it."
"You will never believe me."
"She's in the know."
"I'll do it now."
"How are you holding up?"
"Can you tell me why?"
"How much time do you have?"
"It's a family business."
"I'm in charge."
"We are the same age."
"I don't want her."
"You are a real hero."
"Do you know where she is?"
"He trusts me."
"Your price will be mine."
"You don't want that."
"Seven years ago."
"Do you live nearby?"
"See you tomorrow evening."
"I dropped it."
"It's the same man."
"It was a long day."
"He's a good guy."
"Trust your instincts."
"No, I need it."
"How do you feel now?"
"I finally understood."
"Do you think you can do anything?"
"Have you read the newspaper?"
"We speak the same language."
"I know the perfect place."
"How long have I been here?"
"It helped me a lot."
"Until our next meeting."
"Can everyone hear me?"
"I made an effort."
"Maybe we should wait."
"Someone took it."
"All of them."
"This is one of the reasons."
"I'm happy for her."
"For me, it's good."
"I feel in good shape."
"How are you, my boy?"
"I'm thinking of something."
"You can't go there."
"It's a great movie."
"Have you noticed anything?"
"Yes, that's true."
"How was your date?"
"I'm having a good time."
"Do you know where we're going?"
"It's a private reception."
"Where is he taking us?"
"How did you find that?"
"How did you find that?"
"How did you find that?"
"This is a great opportunity."
"When is it planned for?"
"What class are you in?"
"I'm free tonight."
"We can do without it."
"Do you see me like that?"
"This is what they do."
"They came to my house."
"You don't want to stay?"
"That's the right word."
"He looks like his father."
"You must have faith."
"It's really very good."
"I let myself go."
"Yeah, yeah, that's it."
"Did you discover something?"
"Everything I love."
"Have you ever seen any?"
"I'll be right behind you."
"I'm a good cop."
"I'll take a look at it."
"It's in the kitchen."
"I grew up there."
"That's more than enough."
"But it will take time."
"Are you happy with yourself?"
"You have to go now."
"I like this boy."
"Do what they ask."
"No, I guess not."
"Everyone will be happy."
"This is confidential information."
"I don't drink it."
"I know, that's all."
"How many fingers do I have?"
"It happened to you."
"It's better for him."
"I looked at your file."
"It's a huge responsibility."
"I think you should."
"I'm here for you."
"It's important to you."
"This is my last prize."
"It's all in the past now."
"Can I talk to you outside?"
"I'm right in the middle of it."
"I wish you the best."
"We are on the same side."
"I'll be out in a minute."
"By the sea."
"Where are the other two?"
"That's what they're there for."
"How long will you be staying?"
"What did he see?"
"You're a real friend."
"How did it get there?"
"I already have a job."
"I already have a job."
"Are you saying that for me?"
"I told you so."
"I exercise."
"Clean as a whistle."
"Step aside."
"I took classes."
"What is this attitude?"
"I really like it."
"I have great news."
"Would you excuse us for a moment?"
"Have you been here before?"
"You are a good girl."
"I feel so good."
"Do you know who you are?"
"It's a big piece."
"Who are these guys?"
"Who are these guys?"
"Can I have a drink?"
"I never saw her again."
"No, don't do it."
"They are at home."
"And what is your name?"
"It's time to move."
"I've never been there."
"I hope you like it."
"I see things differently."
"Everything is for the best."
"It's a beautiful evening."
"What is his first name?"
"Nice to finally meet you."
"You have to get out of there."
"Can I have an autograph?"
"You sound like your father."
"What was I supposed to do?"
"Where does that come from?"
"The hospital just called."
"He is under my responsibility."
"I met him yesterday."
"What do they have in common?"
"I knew you would like it."
"What do you want in return?"
"Sorry to barge in like this."
"I was thinking about something."
"Please stand up."
"You don't recognize him?"
"This is the new me."
"Do what she says."
"I like your hair."
"How did I get here?"
"You have to see this."
"I want to go with you."
"Where did I put it?"
"You can never be too careful."
"See you up there."
"Nobody did anything."
"At least, for now."
"Where is the meeting place?"
"I wish I had known him."
"Let's get down to business."
"That's a bit extreme."
"The line was cut."
"I have it with me."
"Well, I don't think so."
"All right, see you later."
"But it suits you."
"I read lips."
"You have a lot of talent."
"Can I place one?"
"More than anyone."
"This is America."
"I have great news."
"Take good care of her."
"I like it too."
"You'll pay me for this."
"What's the title?"
"How much did you pay for it?"
"I've seen your movies."
"This is the official version."
"I have to tell you."
"So don't do it."
"Are you guys ready?"
"Will you grant me this dance?"
"When did you see him?"
"Have fun, guys."
"Who is the best?"
"I need answers."
"I'm pumped."
"I know you by heart."
"I think I see."
"Where were you this morning?"
"I'm going to do something."
"They won't know."
"What am I accused of?"
"You have half an hour."
"I travel through time."
"This is our only way out."
"Come closer, please."
"I forgot my hat."
"I know it by heart."
"You are my little girl."
"They are all there."
"You're on time."
"And you, how are you?"
"Do you want some aspirin?"
"I thought I'd find you here."
"I must be something else."
"I need an answer."
"Same for me."
"I would never do that to you."
"I'll pass the message on to him."
"Yes, she's mine."
"What if she's right?"
"I want to check something."
"I met a woman."
"The police were called."
"I don't fight."
"What more do you want?"
"He's still there."
"Yes, of course yes."
"It gives me chills."
"I have a lot of money."
"We're taking him with us."
"I'm going to fill up."
"I'm in the car."
"I work in a bank."
"Your secret is well kept."
"How long are you staying?"
"Monsters don't exist."
"I will speak."
"I never will be."
"Put it with the others."
"You have good eyes."
"No, I saw it."
"He is in love with me."
"You're my best friend."
"They're coming for us."
"Ticket, please."
"Who is your friend?"
"Can we see each other tomorrow?"
"How do you know her?"
"Do you want to talk about that?"
"Let's see what you have."
"I'll have the same thing."
"How can he do that?"
"I'm making you an offer."
"I would like to say the same."
"I will be outside."
"What could I have done?"
"Have you thought about that?"
"Can I borrow your car?"
"I had one."
"My reputation is at stake."
"Nice to see you again."
"Who gave it to you?"
"Is there any gas?"
"Does it make you feel good?"
"I'll give you a price."
"There is a map."
"You changed my life."
"Can you afford it?"
"You should come more often."
"He's upstairs."
"How did you meet?"
"She can't hear you."
"There will be a trial."
"I have all the papers."
"I have to go to bed."
"I will take care of them."
"How did you meet him?"
"You're not finished yet?"
"I'll go see up there."
"It might take some time."
"Where can we find it?"
"I'll take you at your word."
"So what happened?"
"Nice to have met you."
"Caught red-handed."
"Was school good?"
"There are enough."
"Which hotel are you staying at?"
"How did they find us?"
"I am self-employed."
"You weren't."
"I'll drink to that."
"He went through there."
"Have you lived here for a long time?"
"Why did you say that?"
"This is good stuff."
"They are good people."
"They are good people."
"But what if it were true?"
"Sorry about the other night."
"I needed time."
"Can we take a look?"
"You must know one thing."
"You won't find it."
"I work for the FBI."
"Because it is."
"Do you have anything better?"
"Yes, I feel good."
"A mint candy?"
"What is it about?"
"I came to talk to you."
"I heard you talking."
"This time it's done."
"My name is Benjamin Linus."
"What else do you want?"
"It's for my daughter."
"I just found it."
"I just thought of it."
"I need something."
"I have to go out for a while."
"Are you telling me the truth?"
"But of course not."
"I've never seen you."
"No special treatment."
"I'll meet you downstairs."
"Take her home."
"I got your messages."
"How did you get here?"
"Have you finished your homework?"
"Who are these?"
"I have water."
"He took his time."
"What do you know about her?"
"I have loads of them."
"Who do they think they are?"
"I've known her for a long time."
"They didn't take anything."
"What did they do to you?"
"How many of you are there?"
"But of course it does."
"He had his fill."
"We've all done it."
"Who is this young man?"
"Can I buy you a coffee?"
"I have to go get him."
"Do you want to see something?"
"How long will he be here?"
"That's the whole question."
"Do you feel capable of it?"
"Isn't she cute?"
"It's all yours."
"Shall we have a coffee?"
"We are one."
"We are one."
"You know what, guys?"
"Did you let him go?"
"And a year of joy."
"How do you feel now?"
"I heard things."
"Should I call the police?"
"See you at the wedding."
"Do you trust him?"
"The law of the strongest."
"Have you ever been in love?"
"Where were you last night?"
"When did this happen?"
"It's inside."
"This is the easy part."
"No more than the others."
"Your name, please."
"Do you know who he is?"
"They've been there."
"You are a true friend."
"Yes, you can say that."
"Take good care of him."
"Take good care of him."
"I'll get him out."
"This is perfect for you."
"Please step back."
"On a whim."
"It's his birthday soon."
"And what are you going to do?"
"It's a special day."
"Say it to my face."
"You're not going to say anything?"
"It makes me nauseous."
"What did I just say?"
"As much as it takes."
"This is the next step."
"Everything will be fine."
"What a pleasure to meet you."
"Come up, please."
"She's just a girl."
"Have you had any news?"
"Can I have one?"
"Yes, it's right here."
"She's upside down."
"It's all in your head."
"Can you believe it?"
"Can you believe it?"
"I want another one."
"If I remember?"
"What are you going to do to me?"
"Same time next week?"
"It can't be that."
"You know that, right?"
"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
"We should all go."
"I've been there before."
"It's been a long road."
"Look how beautiful she is."
"She overdosed."
"What am I supposed to do?"
"Do you want to play cards?"
"Does she know?"
"Show some respect."
"She didn't think so."
"I don't have any."
"I don't have any."
"When did you know?"
"When did you learn it?"
"What are you doing here?"
"I just want to talk to him."
"You told me so."
"I had a good reason."
"I hear music."
"It is sure and certain."
"Stay where you are."
"And how are you going to do it?"
"I came to see you."
"Was I at that dinner?"
"You're hiding something from us."
"You see, it's easy."
"They are all like that."
"We'll take a look."
"I would like to be sure."
"Who gave this order?"
"They let me go."
"You've never tried."
"He's her boyfriend."
"Do you know where they are?"
"I want to make a deal."
"We have to hold on."
"Have you never seen one?"
"This is the right address."
"It looks wonderful."
"I need a doctor."
"We can go together."
"What if no one comes?"
"And who is he?"
"It just happened."
"It's a good job."
"It must be so."
"I'll take over."
"Good aim, good shot."
"Can I have some coffee?"
"It was self-defense."
"I'm going to go talk to them."
"I really need to talk to you."
"What's there?"
"I need a signature."
"It makes all the difference."
"You are a lucky man."
"You should be in bed."
"She is a charming woman."
"And we leave."
"Do you think you scare me?"
"You've done your homework."
"You heard the lady."
"I feel pretty good."
"How do you know that?"
"I've been there before."
"It's a foregone conclusion."
"I really want to."
"You are in good health."
"I know where they are going."
"This is his last chance."
"Miss, please."
"I went shopping."
"I'll be there in ten minutes."
"The idea is mine."
"We told you."
"I'll show you something."
"That must be a record."
"What needs to be done."
"I would never say that."
"Thank you for saying that."
"Don't say otherwise."
"Of course, right away."
"And you, what are you?"
"Please what?"
"What are you here for?"
"He just woke up."
"It really makes me happy."
"We want the same thing."
"She reminds me of someone."
"I'm at the door."
"No, that doesn't mean anything to me."
"We're all going to go through it."
"What are we talking about here?"
"We're going to do something."
"I'll give you a chance."
"Yes, I swear."
"I'm going to the police."
"You have to go around."
"I'm beginning to believe it."
"This is what we have."
"Come out, please."
"There is a chance."
"I ask myself the question."
"I don't think about it anymore."
"It's for kids."
"What is he getting at?"
"What happened to him?"
"Where did this photo come from?"
"How are you two doing?"
"The cycle of life."
"Just you and me."
"Where is he heading?"
"Tomorrow is a big day."
"I'm going to close my eyes."
"Do you have any beer?"
"I got used to it."
"There is no question of that."
"Do you want to see a picture?"
"This is my favorite part."
"I want you."
"What do you want exactly?"
"Do you want to make yourself useful?"
"What does your instinct tell you?"
"How do you know this name?"
"Shall we change the subject?"
"Are you expecting visitors?"
"Glad you're back."
"It's good to be home."
"Two bullets in the head."
"It's a beautiful party."
"Give him my regards."
"Did you really say that?"
"The toilets are over there."
"Yes, that's the idea."
"There is a photo."
"I spoke to the director."
"Tell him to come here."
"I'm going to get someone."
"You didn't have to."
"It's on the right track."
"It's perfect for me."
"You can't say anything."
"You can't say anything."
"I have big plans."
"Don't you know?"
"What do you think about this?"
"Do you live with your parents?"
"I am with a friend."
"I didn't choose anything."
"You need a vacation."
"We'll take a look."
"And who is that?"
"Yes, I read that."
"Has anyone seen her?"
"Why are you telling me about it?"
"How old are you?"
"The charges were dropped."
"Shall we play hide and seek?"
"We got fucked."
"Who wants to party?"
"And what did you say?"
"Have you read the newspaper?"
"Would you like another drink?"
"You have it in front of you."
"Why are you still here?"
"It's up to you to find out."
"You caught me off guard."
"We go in and out."
"One question at a time."
"You've had enough."
"It comes from there."
"So, where were we?"
"You are our last hope."
"I still have time."
"Nice to meet you."
"She didn't say it."
"What are you going to do to us?"
"I want to go home."
"I know how to use it."
"My car is in the garage."
"I was told everything."
"I don't take any."
"He was very kind."
"Look what we have."
"I'm going back to the hospital."
"He was shot."
"Is this beer?"
"Can't you see me?"
"Shall I bring you something?"
"Do you want it or not?"
"I would like to say a few words."
"I thought I did it."
"It was a good thing."
"What's it like up there?"
"No, I don't care."
"This is a sensitive subject."
"Yes, there are."
"We're having fun, aren't we?"
"Isn't that right?"
"You owe me an explanation."
"And what is it for?"
"No, that's not all."
"It sounds simple."
"If we have time."
"Are you going to say something?"
"Have you read it yet?"
"Can I get you something else?"
"What is your job?"
"I promise you, Mom."
"You are a good mother."
"Do you see who it is?"
"It was a new age."
"I expected better."
"What's his thing?"
"What's up, guys?"
"No one can say."
"Where did you put it?"
"Vehicle permit and papers."
"I'll be down in a minute."
"You came looking for me."
"Maybe it's serious."
"Yes, I heard you."
"He always did."
"Look where we are."
"She's hiding something from us."
"Do you see all these people?"
"There is a way out."
"It cheers me up."
"That's what he's here for."
"Breakfast is served."
"I'll be there in two minutes."
"Where did the other one go?"
"Can I use your phone?"
"I have great news."
"What am I going to do now?"
"I'll take that one."
"You needed me."
"Where did you meet him?"
"I'm going to open the window."
"What are these questions?"
"Who said that?"
"I just want to have fun."
"That's it, man."
"We'll finish this later."
"It's not for sale."
"They are in the house."
"Mind your own business."
"Where did you get that?"
"Yes, that's the one."
"This is how we will proceed."
"It's a start, right?"
"You'll get used to it."
"We've always done it."
"You understood very well."
"He is a handsome man."
"It's like talking to a wall."
"What are these manners?"
"Do you want some pie?"
"What condition is she in?"
"I'll do that later."
"Is this justice?"
"This is our best lead."
"I am by your side."
"I have to check something."
"I've heard enough."
"How can I thank you?"
"Let's take action."
"Where can I reach you?"
"I'll show it to you."
"You are not ready."
"Can I come see you?"
"Where did you get them?"
"He's in the know."
"We have done our duty."
"He's just a kid."
"Can you close the door?"
"What is this man doing here?"
"Don't ask me how."
"Don't ask me how."
"Exactly what I wanted."
"It's your first day."
"You didn't listen?"
"Everyone will be there."
"No, I didn't do anything."
"He's giving me the creeps."
"What are you going to do to him?"
"I will come back as soon as possible."
"She's doing her best."
"Are you proud of me?"
"Not necessarily in that order."
"Have you seen your mother?"
"You are not normal."
"Peace be with you."
"You are his best friend."
"It's almost time."
"Everyone knows you."
"I like it."
"I know you can."
"You took everything from me."
"You're a smart guy."
"You told me about it."
"Beautiful, aren't they?"
"No, we don't know."
"I never knew."
"She is an old lady."
"What should I call you?"
"What condition is it in?"
"The whole family is there."
"I'll manage on my own."
"She doesn't talk to me anymore."
"There is a possibility."
"It's mine too."
"I just figured it out."
"Nice to see you too."
"Because of my father."
"I'll show you your room."
"I came home early."
"So, what do you want to do?"
"On whose orders?"
"No, I wasn't sleeping."
"I'm going to the car."
"I just want to see you."
"Is there any room left?"
"You're lucky."
"Have you seen it before?"
"I think he's asleep."
"He's doing a good job."
"Can we talk in private?"
"Sorry to barge in like this."
"I'll make coffee."
"How many do you have left?"
"Thank you, I will repay you for that."
"I wish you good morning."
"They look good."
"It's our livelihood."
"A deal is a deal."
"I know where you live."
"Yes, you said it."
"I never thought about it."
"You had to take care of it."
"Merry Christmas to you too."
"Can I play with you?"
"It's a one-way ticket."
"Let's take cover."
"I get up early tomorrow."
"They are right behind us."
"You might need it."
"You might need it."
"You look better."
"How much time is left?"
"I'll read it to you."
"I decided to leave."
"She won't go far."
"It is locked."
"It should have been you."
"I have a pass."
"But what have I done?"
"You did all that?"
"That was last year."
"She changed my life."
"They don't."
"Don't you have anything better?"
"You come with me."
"There is a place."
"Ladies, please."
"You did your job."
"That's the difference."
"What is your name?"
"What is your name?"
"Can I go to the bathroom?"
"And it was."
"She gave this to me."
"It happened to you."
"Passport, please."
"This is my big brother."
"I came to say goodbye."
"Do you think you scare me?"
"You know how they are."
"You know how they are."
"I must act."
"There was a lawyer."
"It's easy to understand."
"I'm asking you nicely."
"It's time to start."
"Call me when you get back."
"And I'm proud of it."
"It's you or me."
"Ask me anything."
"I'm going anyway."
"He is in nature."
"Don't shout like that."
"Are you sure about that?"
"They don't know anything about it."
"It's near here."
"I was going to come see you."
"I am very happy about it."
"It's on the list."
"Let's see what it is."
"This one is mine."
"These are two different things."
"I did it too."
"In the waiting room."
"There is one condition."
"At least, I think so."
"I know you by heart."
"I have plenty to spare."
"I don't know, Tony."
"They're just waiting for that."
"He is a good doctor."
"Are you related to him?"
"I'll call you back later."
"What he said."
"You did well."
"It is a military operation."
"What do you expect from me?"
"Of course, you are right."
"Of course, you're right."
"It was for work."
"I'll make him talk."
"It's a pretty dress."
"The door is wide open."
"But I saw you."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"He looked normal."
"I'm fine and you?"
"What if I do?"
"I never go there."
"Where did you meet him?"
"Have you seen my son?"
"Have you found a job?"
"I don't want to live."
"We're going three."
"You're good at this."
"Would you mind leaving us?"
"I will come back another time."
"How are you, my dear?"
"Have you eaten anything?"
"But it is very important."
"You're still the same."
"I was in my room."
"Psychopaths and writers."
"He's a good kid."
"He changed my life."
"I have always loved you."
"We're going to do this right."
"I was coming home."
"That's the truth, isn't it?"
"I want to do this well."
"Are you back together?"
"And that's an order."
"Did you find someone?"
"This is research."
"This one is for you."
"Have you noticed anything?"
"Glad you're here."
"There are only two of them."
"I go back to the car."
"You have to go."
"I'm sorry about yesterday."
"You need to get treatment."
"All right, here we are."
"Tell me where you're going."
"Your parents must be proud."
"Let's not be late."
"He opened his eyes."
"She's in my pocket."
"We are safe here."
"I can only imagine."
"Are you thinking of someone?"
"I'm still your father."
"That's all for you."
"Yes, it is."
"He will take care of you."
"Are you ready for this?"
"It's for TV."
"I'm not here anymore."
"Do you remember anything?"
"I'll put it another way."
"Nice to meet you."
"What's happening now?"
"You have read my file."
"Welcome to the Ocean Club."
"I'll ask you the question again."
"He looks like it."
"Do you want to have dinner with me?"
"For security reasons."
"It's gasoline."
"I have to go, darling."
"I don't speak English."
"How long have you been together?"
"Everyone has it."
"You are a good man."
"Is all this true?"
"What are they going to do to us?"
"Because I loved you."
"I'm going to go freshen up."
"Maybe I should leave."
"You have to tell me everything."
"That's what matters."
"I'm going to get a beer."
"You have to start somewhere."
"Just in case."
"I heard your conversation."
"As I tell you."
"She only has me."
"I know how he thinks."
"He has a lot of work."
"Are we on air?"
"She is at school."
"How are you, my boy?"
"Well, that's great."
"I have to go to work."
"I have to get back to it."
"It worked for me."
"Do you want some beer?"
"I think you know."
"I apologize to you."
"How could I know?"
"You came to see me."
"I never wanted this."
"Did you receive my letters?"
"Do you see how it works?"
"I paid for it."
"It's in two weeks."
"I want to play with you."
"Honey, I have to go."
"What do we know about her?"
"What did they tell you?"
"I want to try something."
"I'll get to the point."
"They can't do that."
"I forgot mine."
"It's a little chilly."
"Give me a leg up."
"You will see for yourself."
"Have you seen him recently?"
"Keep an eye on her."
"Keep an eye on her."
"I hope not."
"I went to war."
"Okay, let's go."
"Leave it, I'll do it."
"He's going to need it."
"Where are you going with this?"
"I called security."
"I can't concentrate."
"How did they know?"
"I was looking forward to this."
"Wait, I'll take care of it."
"It's not there anymore."
"I ask you the question."
"You can count on that."
"They are no longer there."
"Cash or credit card?"
"Are you thinking of something?"
"Thank you for taking me."
"You don't recognize him?"
"The light went out."
"It's in his interest."
"Let's see where this takes us."
"No, I couldn't."
"I found a job."
"But what have you done?"
"I want to see him now."
"Did you notify the police?"
"One, two, three and four."
"I was at church."
"Someone high up."
"How did you meet her?"
"He is safe."
"I'll tell you how."
"She is like her mother."
"I'll meet you there."
"Can you wait a minute?"
"Did someone call me?"
"Look him in the eyes."
"What's the deal?"
"This shouldn't happen."
"I got the answering machine."
"Call if needed."
"Calm down, everything is fine."
"Oh yeah, that's it."
"They had their chance."
"It's a nice surprise."
"Are there any deaths?"
"She looks like her mother."
"You will tell him yourself."
"Who told him?"
"He saw something."
"But I like you."
"What else do you have?"
"Can't you hear it?"
"I haven't changed anything."
"It's packed."
"I will make the introductions."
"I did the army."
"I'll wait for you downstairs."
"You're the expert."
"Can I have a soda?"
"I have a toothache."
"You don't recognize her?"
"Have you seen the others?"
"I always wondered."
"We can count on him."
"If you'll excuse me."
"I will introduce him to you."
"He's right, you know."
"Did they tell you that?"
"It's getting dark."
"You saw the plans."
"You haven't learned anything."
"They don't talk to each other anymore."
"You are part of me."
"I already called him."
"Don't go any further."
"And what should I do?"
"It's just an accident."
"It's always been me."
"Put this in your pocket."
"Take a look at this."
"I solved the case."
"It will only take a minute."
"I need to rest."
"I assure you it is."
"I will come with you."
"She was in my class."
"Vital signs are good."
"Put them on the table."
"I have so many questions."
"Where is the investigation?"
"Are you ready to order?"
"Yes, of course, I understand."
"It's upside down."
"This time I'm going."
"Where are you going?"
"As much as possible."
"She's your best friend."
"Who is this young woman?"
"Don't go there."
"You are safe and sound."
"Everything will be fine for you."
"Is he breathing?"
"Because I'm pregnant."
"They may have left."
"Here's what I know."
"This is what it looks like."
"I'll bring you something to eat."
"I've heard it before."
"I've heard it before."
"He's a good match."
"Where did you learn that?"
"Yes, that's why."
"I promise you I won't."
"It's part of me."
"It's better than that."
"We'll get through this."
"You have to make a decision."
"She was a nice girl."
"I was passing through the neighborhood."
"Have you been there before?"
"Have you been there before?"
"It's going to be okay, buddy."
"What if it was?"
"You're the one responsible."
"It's been a while, huh?"
"He will be back soon."
"How many children do you have?"
"But on one condition."
"Are you proud of yourself?"
"She doesn't have a boyfriend."
"I read your letter."
"I have to call my mother."
"Who was this guy?"
"I just want the truth."
"There are exceptions."
"Yes, you did."
"Only one at a time."
"Do you have something to write about?"
"I found that."
"I will never say it."
"I can't think."
"How old are you now?"
"This is indeed the case."
"It's my brother's."
"That's the only difference."
"I am a reasonable man."
"What were you doing there?"
"I ask you for a moment."
"We're leaving in an hour."
"Please listen."
"Can we get out of here?"
"I have a good memory."
"I prayed for him."
"How did you get it?"
"I love you, goodbye."
"I'll give you a price."
"It's a good deal."
"You have to get used to it."
"She left a note."
"What's his name again?"
"Maybe not for you."
"I have to get back to the lab."
"Dinner is almost ready."
"Do you want to be my wife?"
"So far, so good."
"Well, thank you."
"We'll find something."
"What's in there?"
"I wanted to be sure."
"It's mine too."
"We'll find one."
"Not in front of everyone."
"You want to tell me why?"
"Don't ask any questions."
"Well, where is he?"
"Do what she says."
"See you downstairs."
"Let's not talk about him."
"Will you call me later?"
"I'll let you work."
"What did you call me?"
"We'll come back to this later."
"Yes, I saw it."
"Would you like to eat something?"
"It's important, I hope."
"What is your last memory?"
"How did he get here?"
"I'll tell them everything."
"This is my private life."
"The end of the world is coming."
"I'll get you out."
"I'm setting off."
"I'd like something to drink."
"And what do you think about it?"
"She is not happy."
"I have a new one."
"I have a new one."
"Who sent you here?"
"I found someone."
"What if it was you?"
"And the answer is yes."
"What about freedom of expression?"
"Shall we have a beer?"
"I have to say something."
"Where do you want to start?"
"What do you have for me?"
"Tell your mother."
"But who are you?"
"But who are you?"
"Of course, Mr. President."
"She is a lovely girl."
"What kind of world do we live in?"
"You can tell us."
"I'm staying in the area."
"It's a big responsibility."
"It's a bit heavy."
"When did you know?"
"For me, it's important."
"I just told him."
"We will find another solution."
"He may be sick."
"You need a vacation."
"There is a policeman."
"I'm going back to the beach."
"He really did it."
"We start from the beginning."
"I went to see her."
"It's for their own good."
"It's going to take hours."
"What can we do for you?"
"Have you had enough?"
"I'll give it to you as a gift."
"She won't make it."
"I'm happy for you."
"Do you know who we are?"
"No, I'm just passing through."
"I agree."
"Did you like the movie?"
"It might be serious."
"What's the number?"
"Where did you put it?"
"This is your home."
"I'll get some glasses."
"Ah, that feels good."
"I saw you coming."
"All you have."
"The icing on the cake."
"Yes, she did."
"You should have been there."
"She's my soulmate."
"Who asked you?"
"This is my ex-husband."
"You look great."
"You asked me?"
"How many did you take?"
"I need one."
"I'm looking for him."
"There's a little left."
"And that's where it ends."
"It must be the heat."
"I checked twice."
"Take some rest."
"Anything and everything."
"He is at the hotel."
"We'll take it back for you."
"And that's it."
"The master has betrayed us."
"I will take care of you."
"I want to speak to the director."
"There's not much."
"She didn't eat anything."
"Have you met before?"
"It's part of the job."
"No, I gave up."
"Put that on my tab."
"Everyone knows me."
"Very well, thank you."
"What am I going to do with it?"
"How should I take it?"
"I called several times."
"It will do for this time."
"I was at school."
"Did you tell him that?"
"I want to take a picture."
"Let's take a closer look."
"I'll call security."
"It belonged to my mother."
"I'm going to sit there."
"That's how life is."
"Glad you're here."
"I saw the news."
"I did things."
"Something had to be done."
"Do you have it on you?"
"It wasn't them."
"It's in the book."
"So, are you leaving?"
"If you want to leave, leave."
"I am ready to pay."
"Why are you telling me this?"
"He doesn't know anything about it."
"I really liked him."
"I have to go, Mom."
"It's a bit far."
"What do you want to tell me?"
"Everyone heard?"
"Bring him inside."
"Yes, I will go."
"Come on, you can do it."
"Do you want to party?"
"You don't want it anymore?"
"Since when have you been interested?"
"I arrived on time."
"I'm in a cabin."
"She was my mother's."
"What is your job?"
"You are a great man."
"It's over for the two of us."
"It's in the genes."
"You almost had me."
"Thank you for stopping by."
"I'm going to the car."
"I think I can."
"Two boys and a girl."
"You are a man now."
"We'll take care of the rest."
"It's all over between us."
"What are you trying to prove?"
"It's a big decision."
"How did I end up here?"
"That's nice to hear."
"This is just the beginning."
"Hence your presence here."
"They found a body."
"Come see for yourself."
"It's quite a process."
"It's meant to be."
"Did you call the cops?"
"He is in your office."
"Maybe me too."
"I already told them."
"How long have you known her?"
"Can I come in for a minute?"
"What was the plan?"
"What's this guy's name?"
"It's always the same."
"Go fuck yourself."
"I wish you success."
"I'm going to see the police."
"He has a good head."
"How are you, my friend?"
"It's an old trick."
"I take care of others."
"Not to that extent."
"I'll be back tomorrow."
"You didn't know her."
"What if I'm right?"
"He is at university."
"Why are you still here?"
"You are a good father."
"You have to take care of it."
"He paid in cash."
"What is this job?"
"Have they reached the Shire?"
"I am many things."
"I'll go then."
"I am a new man."
"It must run in the family."
"Who is not there?"
"I never came."
"You're on air."
"Is everything okay around here?"
"What did you call him?"
"I need to know more."
"I want to see his file."
"You will need me."
"And how do you know that?"
"It's for girls."
"I'll stay with him."
"What if she says no?"
"It could have been us."
"Take a look at this."
"Same as me."
"You're not finished yet?"
"I found a job."
"I want to go to bed."
"You're making things up."
"You're out of luck."
"This is slavery."
"This is a private meeting."
"Have you seen the newspaper?"
"I am a busy man."
"I'm going to call my mother."
"Will you keep me informed?"
"It helps pass the time."
"I see perfectly."
"Where does this lead?"
"What's your thing?"
"I'll give you some."
"It's a bit personal."
"It's been a long time."
"I'm in insurance."
"Excuse me, please."
"Would you excuse us?"
"I could come with you."
"They left this morning."
"I'm going to take my shower."
"The appointment is made."
"Do you have alcohol?"
"I need proof."
"I'll leave you to yourselves."
"That's all it is."
"Have a little faith."
"What did you give him?"
"We'll take care of him."
"That's a lot to take in."
"My mother and my father."
"We told you."
"We can take care of it."
"What are you going to do then?"
"I always have a plan."
"He's my best friend."
"If you say so, sir."
"Good luck to all of you."
"Drink some water."
"I know where to find you."
"You must be aware."
"As you did."
"I'll take care of it, sir."
"You have to understand."
"They call it the Worm?"
"She's worth it."
"You are the doctor."
"I'm a nice guy."
"The controls are no longer responding."
"So how is he doing?"
"I took a bath."
"We are close to the goal."
"I'll spare you the details."
"It should go well."
"I'll take my coat."
"Yes, it's right there."
"You see I'm delighted."
"It's on the table."
"Show me how you do it."
"Have you seen my wife?"
"Have you seen my wife?"
"He would be proud of you."
"I was in the car."
"I discovered something."
"Let me introduce you to my friends."
"So where are you from?"
"You don't know how to hit?"
"One of us."
"I can get you out."
"I like this name."
"Was the day good?"
"Everyone is having fun."
"One second, please."
"It should be possible."
"No, I'll manage."
"One can only hope."
"Have I been clear enough?"
"I hope so for you."
"I am a light sleeper."
"I love him too."
"She is in great shape."
"No, it was something else."
"Can you take us there?"
"I can walk on my own."
"He served his sentence."
"You always knew it."
"You have the answer to everything."
"I'll get it for you."
"Can I trust him?"
"Shall I bring you something?"
"This is a good opportunity."
"You still have time."
"The car keys."
"I can't do more."
"She was my father's."
"Everyone adores you."
"How did you guess?"
"Can anything be done?"
"Why do you always say that?"
"We count to three."
"This is an important moment."
"Can you give me one?"
"But they did."
"I'll talk to you later."
"I've never seen one."
"Send someone else."
"You did very well."
"Who is this guy?"
"Is everything okay with you?"
"I'll see you there."
"You promised me."
"It was just a test."
"That's exactly why."
"Do you know who you are?"
"I must leave the Shire."
"Or I'll call the police."
"What condition is he in?"
"Have you had it for a long time?"
"I got rid of it."
"You know how he is."
"Do you have another one?"
"You must be very proud."
"I had to get out."
"I want to make sure."
"I'm going to clean all this up."
"What's the secret?"
"I saw your file."
"I don't know, boss."
"No, I swear."
"I'll have to think about it."
"Come, I want to talk to you."
"It warms the heart."
"And that's it."
"I am responsible for you."
"You should have said so."
"Did I miss something?"
"Of course, I remember."
"Yes, yes, it's me."
"Two and two make four."
"Someone might see us."
"But she did."
"The body is still warm."
"I love you my dear."
"We'd better go home."
"No, that's how it is."
"No, it's too hot."
"Is that all you have?"
"Have you been here before?"
"Sorry to wake you up."
"How did you meet him?"
"How did you meet him?"
"We'll see that later."
"You did this to me."
"I wish I could have seen that."
"This cannot happen."
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"It wasn't the same."
"Can you keep a secret?"
"I know where they are."
"I know where you live."
"Don't you have a cigarette?"
"What can I say to him?"
"You're probably right."
"This applies to you too."
"We'll find another one."
"I'm doing you a favor."
"What is your name, soldier?"
"What are you doing to us now?"
"I'm doing very well."
"Is this within your capabilities?"
"Did you want to say something?"
"They look nice."
"Don't do this now."
"No, no, no, it's okay."
"We'll take care of you."
"I'm going to have a son."
"Because you love him."
"Yes, he just arrived."
"My God, what is this?"
"Get used to it."
"Haven't you heard?"
"Can I call someone?"
"You won't do anything with it."
"Have you ever been in love?"
"You need us."
"This is a good offer."
"Did he give it to you?"
"You're a good cop."
"They let him go."
"What's on your face?"
"I told you so."
"Maybe later."
"Is this within your capabilities?"
"You better come inside."
"It was a real pleasure."
"What color is it?"
"You have to tell me."
"Do you have family?"
"There was reason to."
"You know something about it."
"Water will do."
"And there is better."
"Yes, it's mine."
"Of course, I will."
"I'll see you tomorrow morning."
"Anything else to say?"
"But what have you done?"
"You know everything about me."
"We need to think bigger."
"You helped me a lot."
"Do you want to take my place?"
"What happened next?"
"What's your name again?"
"No, but thank you anyway."
"Where is she now?"
"That, we can say."
"They didn't say."
"Did you tell them that?"
"I'll take another one."
"It's part of the deal."
"I let you down."
"You will always be welcome."
"A friend of a friend."
"You don't know that?"
"I voted for you."
"I knew your father."
"I have a great idea."
"I can't fly."
"And what do we do?"
"Well, I hope so."
"Now that you mention it."
"We have to do it now."
"He owes me a favor."
"We are a big family."
"What did she take?"
"See you later."
"And where are you from?"
"Do you want me to talk?"
"Do you want pizza?"
"If that were the case?"
"I thought I was doing the right thing."
"It's for babies."
"What's the question?"
"Didn't he tell you?"
"Just a quick look."
"Where could she be?"
"It is divine intervention."
"No need to talk about it."
"I wish I could have done more."
"Nice talking to you."
"Have you ever spoken to him?"
"What do you want exactly?"
"It's all old."
"Oh, yeah, that's true."
"You'd think you were hearing my mother."
"I have confidence in myself."
"What does all this mean?"
"He is a good soldier."
"He is a smart boy."
"So what are you doing here?"
"And I'm going to prove it."
"It's a little early."
"I got your call."
"How was school?"
"He is still in surgery."
"What if he's right?"
"Please leave."
"You just have to see."
"It doesn't depend on me."
"I had a hunch."
"For a lot of reasons."
"He's playing with us."
"What do I know about it?"
"Can you explain this to me?"
"Where did you get them?"
"Where did you get them?"
"You know how it works."
"I ask you to leave."
"No, it's not her."
"Have you seen your father?"
"You had me followed?"
"You want me to resign?"
"No, we're leaving."
"The bedroom is over there."
"I'm telling you now."
"I want you to understand."
"I'm on the road."
"But you shouldn't."
"Where did you see it?"
"She'll be right back."
"Honey, please."
"Great work, everyone."
"We have plenty to do."
"Can we talk in private?"
"I haven't tried."
"Until the last drop."
"I will be back soon."
"Tell me about your father."
"How can you not love it?"
"I read the book."
"She should already be here."
"I want that to change."
"I need to talk to you."
"But I'll tell you."
"Do you trust me?"
"We make a good duo."
"Tell me where they are."
"I have a lot to learn."
"You'll never have it."
"I'll give you a ship."
"I got your note."
"Do you want to talk about it now?"
"You're at home here."
"I can do it too."
"You're on speakerphone."
"Very well, as you wish."
"You didn't answer me."
"Why did you bring him?"
"I can't talk right now."
"Can you give me your number?"
"It's going to be okay, sweetie."
"Yes, I received it."
"Is he sleeping?"
"Maybe she knows."
"I want to see my mother."
"What had happened?"
"I saw your photo."
"I don't really understand."
"I thought you were leaving."
"Did you close the door?"
"They knew we were coming."
"What time do you finish?"
"I'll take care of the tickets."
"He needs time."
"The bar is over there."
"What's the next step?"
"You know it as well as I do."
"You have my full attention."
"Is it good or not?"
"I never get tired of it."
"I don't forgive you."
"I'll give it to you."
"I think so."
"Do you have an appointment?"
"Do you want to say hello to him?"
"Do you remember them?"
"And it feels good."
"She's passed out."
"Did you come for that?"
"He's coming straight towards us."
"Where it all began."
"Don't trust them."
"I have one."
"So why did you come?"
"You're a big boy."
"You just have to try."
"She is in the shower."
"Did it give anything?"
"I came to get you."
"She's a great girl."
"What if it was him?"
"I have to live with this."
"I'm pretty sure of it."
"I'm late again."
"Who was that on the phone?"
"I'll get a taxi."
"So where is the money?"
"She is a little shy."
"You're putting on a show."
"Oh yes, I remember."
"Just what I wanted."
"This is the correct answer."
"Do you want to know the truth?"
"Sorry, but it's true."
"And you said yes."
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
"All that is over."
"It's already a start."
"It looks like it does."
"Six weeks ago."
"Tell me about your wife."
"I don't speak Italian."
"They are not."
"It's time to choose."
"It might as well be you."
"You are like your father."
"You didn't ask for anything."
"I'm going to make sandwiches."
"For whatever."
"It's just a hunch."
"This is a secure area."
"Everyone was there."
"It's kindness."
"Did you tell him everything?"
"Left or right?"
"So I'm coming with you."
"I worked with him."
"I heard a voice."
"You don't know each other?"
"What do you know about them?"
"I'm right behind you."
"You taught me that."
"I'll be inside."
"Yes, I will tell him."
"I saw it coming."
"He is from the police."
"It's just the wind."
"Yes, that's his name."
"I have to work."
"He seemed nice."
"I can do without it."
"How do you know his name?"
"How could you know?"
"It's the human condition."
"I'm saying this for you."
"She told me."
"It's a bit fast."
"What's it like there?"
"Can I go see him?"
"What are you getting involved in?"
"Thank you for being there."
"He's in the garage."
"You've said enough."
"Do you want to trade?"
"I say goodbye to you."
"We got a call."
"Nobody heard anything."
"Focus on your breathing."
"Welcome to our humble abode."
"Are we doing business or not?"
"I will take care of it personally."
"Need I say more?"
"She wrote a book."
"Something to tell me?"
"She needs care."
"I'll tell him everything."
"I need information."
"What did you do then?"
"Let's make ourselves comfortable."
"How is he, doctor?"
"Are you seeing another woman?"
"You're hiding things from me."
"It is a university hospital."
"She always did."
"I'll show you something."
"How do you know about this?"
"I had a flash."
"Where did you put it?"
"Yes, I went there."
"He will take care of you."
"He has experience."
"It's a magical place."
"There is something else."
"We have to see each other."
"I'm in the middle of a meeting."
"Are you taking me home?"
"This is a fantastic idea."
"We have another one."
"You got me good."
"That's good, my little one."
"As soon as I'm finished."
"I have it in mind."
"Only one thing interests me."
"You will never find it."
"Where is the baby?"
"But there is better."
"The two girls can leave."
"Don't say that word."
"She's in the phone book."
"He was a good guy."
"Am I not?"
"Do you want to play the hero?"
"Where did you hear that?"
"I wish I had known."
"You are in a hospital."
"An hour, maybe two."
"I thought I'd find you here."
"That's how it is here."
"Route change in progress."
"I am an FBI agent."
"They did not survive."
"There is everything."
"We didn't touch anything."
"I know, I saw."
"Shall I tell you a secret?"
"Nice to have met you."
"I count to five."
"It's time to move on."
"I was just asking."
"Is she breathing?"
"Go in and close the door."
"What should I do then?"
"I saw this movie."
"We're leaving now."
"We need to talk about this."
"I'll buy you a drink."
"What else do you want?"
"How could I have known?"
"I'll keep that in mind."
"I know, it's good."
"Here we are safe."
"It seemed important."
"The lights went out."
"I thought you were in bed."
"I looked on the internet."
"I'm coming back from the hospital."
"Take good care of her."
"You'll love this place."
"No, I'll talk to him."
"I had never seen him."
"It's a bit light."
"She doesn't talk to me."
"It's my favorite color."
"If only it were that simple."
"It's part of the job."
"On whose orders?"
"Where did you meet?"
"Glad you like it."
"Has she seen a doctor?"
"No, I won't."
"Are you proud of yourself?"
"That's a lot to take in."
"Bring me some water."
"We'll go through there."
"We were just talking about you."
"I'll take care of it personally."
"No, you shouldn't."
"But what is it?"
"I left home."
"How is she, doctor?"
"You have to accept their conditions."
"No, it's a gift."
"You made a promise."
"Everyone loved me."
"I saw my father."
"Yes, I heard it."
"I'm leaving in two days."
"I spoke to the prosecutor."
"She is always late."
"He's in my head."
"I received your letter."
"You'll never know."
"Where did she go?"
"It's not just that."
"It's not just that."
"I know you very well."
"I had a few drinks."
"Calm down, everything is fine."
"Do you know where I live?"
"I have a big mouth."
"You have little time."
"This kind of thing happens."
"Thank God it's over."
"It's right next door."
"Would that have changed anything?"
"I suspected it."
"You already have one."
"She didn't call."
"Maybe that's good."
"It is a scientific fact."
"Please pick up."
"I saw his body."
"It's not very far."
"Why are you making that face?"
"It happens to all of us."
"And I said yes."
"And your last name?"
"You don't."
"I really feel better."
"Two nights ago."
"Is there anything new?"
"Better to leave it at that."
"She doesn't live here anymore."
"Guys, let's go."
"Focus on my voice."
"Is it time?"
"Did you swallow your tongue?"
"Did you swallow your tongue?"
"I'm leaving tomorrow."
"Are you coming for a drink?"
"A real fairy tale."
"No, you're not coming."
"Let's stay out of this."
"Where did you meet her?"
"He lives with his mother."
"Don't you like him?"
"It was my last chance."
"It's right across the street."
"Look how beautiful you are."
"Take him inside."
"You would do the same for me."
"I play the guitar."
"She is a young girl."
"It's just a dog."
"Have you known her for a long time?"
"How much did it cost you?"
"And not just any old one."
"It's better for us."
"There is a code."
"I have to go change."
"She has a big mouth."
"I worked for him."
"I'm going to the infirmary."
"No, I've already tried."
"I'll be back in a few days."
"I agree with him."
"You are not anymore."
"Don't you have anything else?"
"All systems are ready."
"I'm in the lobby."
"We still have one chance."
"It's up to you to find out."
"He is a real gentleman."
"No, you have to go."
"Tell me where and when."
"Do you need money?"
"I'll go first."
"It was for fun."
"You barely know her."
"Can I have your autograph?"
"I didn't have any."
"It's not obligatory."
"I won't allow that."
"That is, me."
"I love you very much too."
"Do you want some popcorn?"
"I have a little gift."
"Have you ever done this?"
"I'll take one too."
"She takes after her mother."
"You are responsible for him."
"So what is it for?"
"I should be there."
"But this is the last one."
"But what is it for?"
"They know who you are."
"A dog bit me."
"I'm spending the night here."
"An investigation is underway."
"I am very grateful to you."
"I'm going to the beach."
"You're going to tell me."
"You see I'm delighted."
"I have it right here."
"Because it's over."
"That would be a good thing."
"It had to end like this."
"I don't remember anymore."
"I'll take another one."
"Actually, you're right."
"She is a smart girl."
"This is a great idea."
"It's a beautiful thing."
"I should go home."
"You can't even imagine."
"I have a few."
"There is a party."
"We're going to do it."
"Everything looks good."
"I need company."
"It seems not."
"I'll be back as soon as possible."
"I said yes."
"So where are we going?"
"She made her decision."
"Not far from here."
"And what is your name?"
"Like before."
"What is the real reason?"
"Why are you telling me this?"
"Do you understand anything about it?"
"I'll look downstairs."
"I'll give you my number."
"Did they tell you?"
"It's a simple formality."
"Take her in your arms."
"I liked it."
"He had us good."
"I want to see your face."
"This applies to you too."
"Late, as usual."
"Who needs this?"
"I have always loved you."
"I'm going to call my wife."
"We are at your service."
"Go ahead, spill the beans."
"Do you have another solution?"
"He may have left."
"What can you do about it?"
"It's in our interest."
"She's just a child."
"Whatever that means."
"I filled up."
"I'm expected in court."
"I can let you in."
"I'll get the truck."
"Because you deserve it."
"It looks deserted."
"Is it for the money?"
"She's not sure."
"We have one hour left."
"No, that wasn't it."
"There is food."
"And I will always be here."
"You look great."
"Can you pass me a towel?"
"Listen to me, both of you."
"Where should I put this?"
"But what's wrong?"
"He owes me one."
"Don't even think about it."
"What is your last memory?"
"I looked for it."
"Come let me introduce you."
"How can I do this?"
"How do you see that?"
"You need reinforcements."
"I think it works."
"Do you want a hot dog?"
"Did you call me?"
"This is a crucial moment."
"Yes, it's time."
"Are they all yours?"
"Where did you find that?"
"Don't pay attention to him."
"How many do you need?"
"I need to check."
"You never asked."
"This is my favorite movie."
"The voice of his master."
"You have all the time in the world."
"Do you have any other questions?"
"Why are you telling me?"
"When did you see it?"
"What do we have on him?"
"There will be one."
"So what is this?"
"I was just joking."
"Take a look at this."
"You have two new messages."
"I just walk."
"Okay, that's good."
"I know a good place."
"We're going to call the police."
"This is for you, Dad."
"Where can I find it?"
"That's a good summary."
"Have you ever been married?"
"I want to thank you."
"You are my whole life."
"You're mine now."
"That's everyone."
"I've been around."
"Give me half an hour."
"And what did you say?"
"Who do you think you're talking to?"
"I did that too."
"In a way, yes."
"I think I have an idea."
"What did you tell him?"
"They changed their minds."
"Did he tell you why?"
"Did he tell you why?"
"No, I'm not finished."
"But not all the time."
"I had to come back."
"Can you open the door?"
"I want to go with you."
"This is a true story."
"But that's where it ends."
"He has many friends."
"Who discovered the body?"
"I'll write you a check."
"Do you know who we are?"
"Are you having a good time?"
"Take time to think."
"I will answer your questions."
"What did you want to ask me?"
"It's often like that."
"Have you set a date?"
"Have you seen the news?"
"I like to think so."
"It's for life."
"It must mean something."
"I will never see you again."
"How are you, my dear?"
"And I'm still here."
"To the bathroom."
"Do you have other children?"
"Everything was going well."
"See you at the game."
"Where did you get it?"
"Where did you get it?"
"I need some equipment."
"I hope you do too."
"Are you back together?"
"There are people."
"Give me a second chance."
"A life for a life."
"Everyone is fighting."
"What did you think about it?"
"You don't talk to me anymore?"
"You get that from me."
"I want to trust you."
"Do you want action?"
"How do we do it?"
"With great power comes great responsibility."
"Yes, of course, of course."
"Is this your home?"
"We all know."
"I don't have a brother."
"Do you have enough money?"
"Everything you wanted."
"Do you want us to leave?"
"Did you find the body?"
"I just wanted to protect you."
"Have you made a decision?"
"It's a closed case."
"I don't recognize him anymore."
"You are my little brother."
"It's just a movie."
"What works?"
"No, it's a surprise."
"Previously on The O.C."
"Have you noticed anything?"
"You shouldn't drink."
"Did you receive my letter?"
"It was him or us."
"It's just a name."
"No, I don't care."
"I came to warn you."
"Only if you want to."
"You're going to pay for this."
"I want to tell you everything."
"I live with my mother."
"We don't know anything yet."
"We still have work to do."
"Why did he come here?"
"And they did."
"Good job, everyone."
"This time it's true."
"You have no way out."
"I notified the police."
"And I have to believe you?"
"We are human beings."
"We are human beings."
"Where is the safe?"
"My wife and my son."
"Countdown begins."
"Did you have someone?"
"She can't breathe."
"Did you do something?"
"It's okay for now."
"How small the world is."
"I can fix that for you."
"I'll be back right away."
"What are you made of?"
"But you said it."
"Yes, I can see that."
"Everything is fine, my dear."
"What year was that?"
"You betrayed my trust."
"Yeah, I heard that."
"You changed my life."
"She is in love with him."
"There you go, that's much better."
"This is the right attitude."
"Are you going to the hospital?"
"I read the letter."
"I am here with you."
"Everything is going wonderfully."
"What should I call you?"
"I'm going to the doctor."
"You're a nice guy."
"Is everything okay with you?"
"Is everything okay between you?"
"What if we sat down?"
"You are a brave man."
"It's in two days."
"No, I didn't see anything."
"We're going to take a picture."
"Don't start without me."
"There's nothing better."
"I have a wonderful idea."
"I will be in my quarters."
"In the top drawer."
"I want to get out of this."
"Is this what it's about?"
"We have to go."
"This man is a genius."
"Do you think I can?"
"I'm good for nothing."
"This will be the last time."
"I welcome you."
"We will continue to search."
"For now, at least."
"She didn't do it."
"Do as I tell you."
"Mom, can I talk to you?"
"We have to trust each other."
"You liked it, huh?"
"What you have to do."
"Tell me about your family."
"Nice to meet you."
"I just wanted to introduce myself."
"The jury is back."
"There's that too."
"No, it's too far."
"Where can I find it?"
"Anyway, I have to go."
"You owe me a favor."
"How did they find it?"
"I'm getting you out of here."
"Nobody warned me."
"I'll go with you."
"You're not a man."
"Give me another one."
"You got it."
"Oh, I did it."
"There are cameras."
"And you, what are you?"
"Do you think you're God?"
"It was a different time."
"I have to tell the truth."
"I'll wait for him here."
"No, we're just friends."
"So, where do we start?"
"You would do the same thing."
"Nobody saw me."
"I'll manage on my own."
"I have some change."
"I took one."
"I saw her too."
"Maybe a little bit."
"Yes, he is my son."
"Thank you for supporting me."
"No, it's already done."
"I never have been."
"How did you meet?"
"Do you want to go out with me?"
"Why did you go there?"
"I was born for this."
"What did you want to talk about?"
"I have to look."
"Who else is involved?"
"You're a nice guy."
"I'll be right next door."
"Do you trust him?"
"You are good people."
"What more does he want?"
"I checked it myself."
"We'll talk about it tomorrow morning."
"Are you going to use it?"
"You see, I was right."
"Thank you for breakfast."
"I'm good at this."
"Are you planning to do this for a long time?"
"That was my intention."
"It's in the phone book."
"What do you want to talk about?"
"But you have to do it."
"I wish I could have been there."
"Not as good as you."
"And I am happy about it."
"I'll tell Mom."
"What exactly do you mean?"
"I'm going to leave for a while."
"Give me one more chance."
"Don't talk about him."
"How long has she been here?"
"He is like my brother."
"Are you with someone?"
"It looks good."
"What's wrong with your arm?"
"I want to be with him."
"He'll be right back."
"No one will ever know."
"Should I put on some music?"
"Let's take a closer look."
"Get him out of here."
"Someone has to tell him."
"He works for the government."
"Do you go to church?"
"No, they can't."
"We have to go to the hospital."
"It's my middle name."
"I know, I was there."
"Yes, I'm staying online."
"I have to meet someone."
"Do you know who you are?"
"Have you been married for a long time?"
"There was a boy."
"Can I take notes?"
"Take someone else."
"You know, for the kids."
"You're not married?"
"What is the word?"
"No, I did it."
"Thank you for your concern."
"If I tell you."
"I felt it too."
"She is on our side."
"Have you seen anyone?"
"I'll take my jacket."
"How dare you say that?"
"This way it's better."
"Try not to move."
"Calm down, it'll be okay."
"Up and down."
"It's easy for you."
"I forgot my jacket."
"Why are you telling him that?"
"And what do we do now?"
"It's nice to see."
"You don't get along?"
"It's been ages."
"I'm trying to improve myself."
"I am with a patient."
"That's what I was talking about."
"You're just in time."
"See you up top."
"Shall we go to my office?"
"He came to my house."
"This is quite a surprise."
"What did they ask you?"
"No, I can't do it."
"The best for last."
"What does all this have to do with it?"
"No, but it's true."
"Yes, it is."
"Yes, it is."
"I need a lawyer."
"It's his age."
"I've always done that."
"Would you mind doing it?"
"We don't have anything better."
"He's just a kid."
"For over a year."
"One for one."
"And you know it well."
"I'm past that stage."
"Can I clean the room?"
"He was my father's."
"No, don't get up."
"They weren't there."
"He's my half-brother."
"Have you been doing this for a long time?"
"What is what?"
"I'm on the case."
"I won't say more."
"Did she tell you about it?"
"Here we are, guys."
"I was born like this."
"Nobody tells me anything."
"It's for the principle."
"I'm going to get a soda."
"Is this a good move?"
"I'm going to bed early."
"What am I supposed to say?"
"You seem nice."
"By any means necessary."
"Have you kept in touch?"
"I take care of you."
"You deserve it."
"Do you take it like that?"
"I am with a client."
"I live just across the street."
"Are you offering it to me freely?"
"Who do they think they are?"
"I've never seen them."
"He was right behind me."
"Give him money."
"The director wants to see you."
"Don't ask me that."
"No, it's too late."
"In the middle of the day?"
"I still have questions."
"Am I in the right place?"
"He did his duty."
"I remember that."
"There was one."
"Do you have space?"
"Not what you think."
"I just received them."
"Few people can."
"I have to tell you."
"I'm interested in you."
"Everything is fine, my boy."
"I feel like throwing up."
"Yes, I said that."
"I want to give this to you."
"Go to the other side."
"Go to the other side."
"No, but it's good."
"I'll be in the kitchen."
"You have to trust us."
"I still have a few questions."
"They look delicious."
"It looks good."
"I have to see my son."
"It's to our advantage."
"Nice to see you too."
"He might be there."
"It's all going to be okay."
"No one can do that."
"He arrived this morning."
"That is the question."
"That's the question."
"I am leaving next week."
"As far as you know."
"And you believed it?"
"He is the one responsible."
"I don't know."
"Where do you know each other from?"
"Yes, I'll take care of it."
"I rented a car."
"But everything is fine now."
"You are a good horse."
"But what was I thinking?"
"I have fulfilled my contract."
"I had a baby."
"I will pass the message on to him."
"What color is it?"
"I'm coming to see a friend."
"It comes at just the right time."
"So we all say."
"Yes, that's my name."
"She won't listen to me."
"He is an important man."
"You can take mine."
"I'll take my bag."
"You dropped that."
"Family is sacred."
"Have you been working here for a long time?"
"It's such an honor."
"There are worse things."
"What's got into you?"
"Who is this handsome man?"
"And what is your name?"
"You kept your promise."
"You didn't have to."
"You have to tell him."
"Later in the week."
"That's more than enough."
"It's contraband."
"It's important to her."
"We make a good team."
"And what did you answer?"
"Oh, that's very good."
"Glad you're back."
"It's for my work."
"Come inside, please."
"Put this in your mouth."
"Don't react like that."
"I prefer not to think about it."
"I can still do it."
"It's a good job."
"How did we get here?"
"You should take a vacation."
"Someone you know?"
"Who doesn't?"
"Everyone to work."
"Now I don't know anymore."
"Are you sure you're okay?"
"What are you doing in town?"
"Did I make myself clear?"
"Alert to all units."
"Yes, that would make me happy."
"What did you call me?"
"What did you call me?"
"It's much more important."
"Do you remember everything?"
"What are they doing there?"
"And you didn't say anything?"
"You make a beautiful couple."
"Are you going to get back together?"
"I didn't speak."
"Take care of yourself, okay?"
"You still have a choice."
"Oh, I agree."
"The wind has risen."
"I was waiting for that one."
"I'm happy too."
"What did you dream about?"
"Have you read the newspapers?"
"It's a beautiful name."
"This is for your protection."
"It must be done now."
"That explains a lot."
"She can't hear you."
"I hope this helps."
"Take me in his place."
"I don't think I can."
"You were so kind."
"What's your name again?"
"Have you known her for a long time?"
"They passed by here."
"It's luck."
"Who wants some pie?"
"I have it on me."
"There's no one else."
"Yes, it is quite possible."
"We will see that later."
"There is noise."
"Nice to see you again, sir."
"It has always been like this."
"Call me as soon as possible."
"I had him come."
"Can we go home?"
"And you, where are you going?"
"She is at her mother's house."
"How are you doing, girls?"
"I'm being taken care of."
"You say it like that."
"It was given to me."
"I got you good."
"Where do you know him from?"
"Please don't do this."
"Did you really do that?"
"It's a public place."
"I should have told him."
"You understood very well."
"Yes, I will."
"What do you think of them?"
"I want to make peace."
"It's an election year."
"Don't you miss it?"
"And who are you?"
"I saw his picture."
"Thank you for believing in me."
"It was a good match."
"Can you keep a secret?"
"I want a normal life."
"Please take a seat."
"Tell me who it was."
"It's a piece of cake."
"I believed in you."
"A friend of the family."
"Have you seen the newspaper?"
"Do as you wish."
"No, I promise you."
"I might need it."
"How many do you need?"
"You never will be."
"You're a good girl."
"Who is your friend?"
"Money is needed."
"I have all the time in the world."
"Man of little faith."
"I take care of him."
"Who spilled the beans?"
"I'm going to get something."
"How could you know?"
"It must be this way."
"Are you giving me a hug?"
"I'm having a little fun."
"Do I really have a choice?"
"Will you give me one?"
"With the greatest pleasure."
"How do you know my name?"
"It's quiet tonight."
"I know who you are."
"I have so many questions."
"I forgot your name."
"It is better to be careful."
"There is a car."
"No, I'm still here."
"How did she do that?"
"I think about that."
"I came by your place."
"It was just a game."
"I never knew him."
"Yes, I will remember it."
"And she's a woman."
"I ordered coffee."
"Inspired by a true story."
"You don't like me anymore?"
"He's like my brother."
"There is hope."
"Who is the king?"
"Oh, that feels good."
"I need love."
"He has a lot of talent."
"I'm coming to pick up my wife."
"How long have you been doing this?"
"She can't come."
"You will never have it."
"What did you just say?"
"And how do you know that?"
"It's in the closet."
"We did our best."
"Together we catch killers."
"Can I take your coats?"
"I met a guy."
"You're pissing me off."
"What was on it?"
"I'll tell you what, man."
"You have piqued my curiosity."
"It happened last night."
"Come in, please."
"I want her to leave."
"I have a good reason."
"You better get out."
"I was abroad."
"A little more coffee?"
"Why did you marry him?"
"She means a lot to me."
"Is there a connection?"
"We've heard this before."
"And where are they now?"
"No, it's this way."
"How did you meet?"
"I want to make a deal."
"They were very clear."
"I thought it was good."
"And I have to go."
"Do you have anything to write down?"
"I know where to start."
"You are part of the People."
"Do you need this?"
"Do you trust me?"
"Are they always like this?"
"I have enough friends."
"I want to be like you."
"You're starting to piss me off."
"I have a busy day."
"They need me."
"My nephew and niece."
"It was like a dream."
"You mean like that?"
"Tell him to hurry up."
"I'm in the shower."
"They took my son."
"We'll meet there."
"Of course not, darling."
"I've never experienced that."
"I just wanted to see you."
"Eat whatever you want."
"Have fun tonight."
"I got the role."
"Do you know who they are?"
"How do you do it?"
"I'll get the coffee."
"Good luck to you too."
"You don't talk much."
"You were going to tell me?"
"It's the middle of the night."
"She made a choice."
"I want to work with you."
"I can promise you that."
"And what did you see?"
"As I planned."
"They're a good team."
"No, I found it."
"Why are you still here?"
"Why are you still here?"
"He's a great guy."
"You are retired."
"A bullet in the back of the head."
"I am very happy about it."
"We'll find another one."
"Can we take a look?"
"You can say that."
"She's using you."
"When did you get married?"
"Do you want to take a look?"
"It's a new era."
"Do you think we can?"
"This is how I know."
"Don't play this game."
"You know what, buddy?"
"I should have stopped him."
"They will take care of you."
"We made a bet."
"I'll give you a price."
"Until proven otherwise."
"It's just a loan."
"I like your dress."
"Within reason."
"Go there right away."
"It must be said."
"Can anyone attest to this?"
"Who wants some ice cream?"
"I work for the police."
"I've never felt like this."
"I make you a promise."
"If you can hear me, answer."
"You have a beautiful house."
"This is good coffee."
"I'll get the rest."
"You really love him, huh?"
"I already explained to you."
"Where is the corkscrew?"
"There is a boat."
"Is this the right direction?"
"We have to get started."
"No, I want to."
"I have to get rid of it."
"No, no, it's true."
"How long have you had it?"
"Glad you like it."
"And I've had enough."
"You are the writer."
"What are you going to do, Lamar?"
"Luckily he was there."
"I'm going to get the votes."
"It's German."
"But I agree."
"There is an exit."
"It's locked."
"How can you know that?"
"I thought so with you."
"It's a nice place."
"It's the same for you."
"Do you want another beer?"
"They must have spotted us."
"You've got something there."
"That's it, of course."
"Do you want to go see him?"
"I did a test."
"His wife left him."
"How long have we known each other?"
"It's ice."
"Why are you telling me this?"
"This is the best place."
"What is he accused of?"
"That's saying something."
"You look stressed."
"Because I'm hungry."
"What if it was her?"
"Are you interested or not?"
"I almost died there."
"I want ice cream."
"I feel lighter."
"Here we go, buddy."
"You should have seen her."
"It does something to me."
"Who doesn't love it?"
"Because of your mother?"
"I received the message."
"We'll do as you wish."
"How many did you take?"
"How did all this happen?"
"Someone should do it."
"Come on, this is going to be fun."
"Take time to think."
"Have you reached your verdict?"
"Try to remember that."
"Who is he talking about?"
"Nice to meet you."
"Good night, and good luck."
"Tell him we're coming."
"How could it be otherwise?"
"Everything is upside down."
"Will you excuse me for a moment?"
"What did you do there?"
"Was that your plan?"
"Do you play an instrument?"
"Do you think you can do it?"
"You'll have to follow me."
"I advise you to leave."
"Have you spoken to him recently?"
"Change is good."
"I found the solution."
"This is the big moment."
"We have to try."
"Who is the girl?"
"I was beside myself."
"Don't let her down."
"I'll show them to you."
"No, I'm sure of it."
"It's all over the news."
"We must make an example."
"She is no longer here."
"Do you know where he's going?"
"Call me when you can."
"This is my little boy."
"Are you family?"
"So how are you feeling?"
"I have just one question."
"They are no longer there."
"I did the job."
"This is my life."
"I'm in the dark."
"That's what it is."
"Come down, please."
"Not a penny more."
"Do you want some coke?"
"That's enough for now."
"He changed his name."
"I'll give it to you."
"I'll give it to you."
"I'm making breakfast."
"Why do you want to do this?"
"What does your heart tell you?"
"I'm so lucky."
"I want to try."
"Thank you for telling me that."
"I'll show it to you."
"I finally found it."
"One day you will thank me."
"My God, this is amazing."
"Straight ahead and left."
"You don't look like it."
"You played very well."
"How long will it last?"
"We don't know anything yet."
"I met a man."
"How did you do that?"
"Don't attract attention."
"What's the deal?"
"It's against the rules."
"We're on the right track."
"Where did you get that?"
"Will you let me go?"
"He is different from others."
"What's your first name?"
"You haven't paid."
"Did you let him do it?"
"He has a big mouth."
"Not at this hour."
"This is my first mission."
"How did you find us?"
"I need proof."
"Thank you for meeting me here."
"We'll be back in an hour."
"I have asthma."
"I'm going to buy something."
"I read the reports."
"How do we get out of here?"
"But how do you know?"
"And what do I gain from it?"
"I brought some wine."
"He's quite a character."
"Don't say that, Mom."
"You'll get along well."
"Don't miss your train."
"I'm going to go see them."
"Do you want to make a fuss?"
"No, it's fine like that."
"An idea comes to me."
"I'm not sure yet."
"Where did you take her?"
"He is also my son."
"Can I take the car?"
"Don't you like her?"
"Everything is fine, my love."
"As you did."
"You are my last hope."
"You should be more careful."
"Maybe you're right."
"I brought him here."
"And you believed her?"
"The rest is up to you."
"I need a cigarette."
"It looks real."
"Well, that's good."
"Where are you going with that?"
"It's a hot dog."
"No, I want to go."
"Your appointment is here."
"I needed the money."
"Don't you want to sit down?"
"It's in the Constitution."
"It's safer here."
"Who told you?"
"I'm taking her home."
"She is a good friend."
"You have to say something."
"Where did you get that from?"
"You haven't eaten?"
"This night is yours."
"Please move along."
"He came to get me."
"She may have left."
"Do you want to talk?"
"No, I shouldn't."
"You weren't ready."
"If you change your mind."
"I was there first."
"Maybe I should go home."
"I did all that."
"How could I have known?"
"I'll get you out of here."
"As far as possible."
"Can you go get it?"
"I was just asking that."
"She is different from others."
"He is the strongest."
"It's for fun."
"I find it very interesting."
"Maybe you should."
"How did you find that?"
"I quite agree."
"He is in the room."
"I'm just the messenger."
"Put that on my account."
"This one is for me."
"Fifteen years ago."
"Can I have a drink?"
"What's wrong with your face?"
"You did this to me."
"Can you tell me?"
"I'm in the elevator."
"It's painting."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"Are you sure you want to?"
"I always think of you."
"Did you find someone?"
"What are you referring to?"
"Take a look at this."
"Take a look at this."
"Are you with someone?"
"I'll take a look over there."
"I have a good job."
"Where's your head?"
"I apologize for him."
"You will see for yourself."
"It's going to be your party."
"No, I'll take it."
"I'll be back in two days."
"Please come back."
"Is there a doctor?"
"What's that smile?"
"I don't count them anymore."
"That gives us time."
"Does it ring a bell?"
"It had never happened."
"That's the whole difference."
"She was a little girl."
"A road accident."
"And you, how are you?"
"The house was searched."
"I signed a contract."
"What are you still doing standing up?"
"I'll take care of it immediately."
"It's just my business."
"You don't say hello?"
"You do it for yourself."
"Everything will work out in the end."
"I'll find another one."
"He looks normal."
"What did you do to me?"
"I saw his eyes."
"What grade are you in?"
"Someone we know?"
"Don't call him that."
"You are a beautiful woman."
"You are a beautiful woman."
"You are a beautiful woman."
"Nice to talk to you."
"And the rest of the time?"
"Who does he think I am?"
"I need details."
"I have faith in him."
"I hope I did well."
"How much did you pay for it?"
"You are a good doctor."
"A little gift for you."
"He did his job."
"Are you going to mass?"
"No, I'm his father."
"I didn't know them."
"Do you want to know something?"
"Did you have an affair?"
"I'll come up right away."
"I'll take care of her."
"And what did she say?"
"Do you need him?"
"Is this the only reason?"
"Nothing to do with that."
"You'll find something."
"Isn't she lovely?"
"No, I would remember it."
"Do you need money?"
"Is that the reason?"
"Can I take a bath?"
"What are you going to do with it?"
"And I believe in you."
"Are you in or not?"
"Yes, it's very good."
"You can trust them."
"Who is this girl?"
"Do you have any ice?"
"I think you can."
"You must already know this."
"I need caffeine."
"What if I did?"
"Let's do what he says."
"Who will take care of it?"
"I found this too."
"Why did you take it?"
"Glad you're doing well."
"It's just a dream."
"Do you still want to take me?"
"No resurrection ship."
"And where are you from?"
"It was the good life."
"Not to everyone."
"Am I on speakerphone?"
"I made an appointment."
"I'll call you when I arrive."
"He is on the road."
"That's it, goodbye."
"We have to trust each other."
"I'm doing it on my own."
"This is your home too."
"What kind of world do we live in?"
"I wanted to make myself useful."
"Stand against the wall."
"You're going to screw everything up."
"You helped us a lot."
"You didn't say that."
"I can smell it from here."
"And more than once."
"What do I get in exchange?"
"I want him to stay."
"If it can help you."
"Everything is fine for me."
"Have you discovered something?"
"I'm going to call my father."
"You just made it up."
"I want to do it now."
"He is the boss."
"Nobody ever comes here."
"That wasn't the question."
"I appreciate it."
"Have you seen my mother?"
"Thanks for letting us know."
"I didn't want to."
"It may be related."
"He is in the garden."
"I can't talk to him."
"If you ask me."
"Don't tell Mom anything."
"Do you want to watch the match?"
"Nobody's going to hang you."
"I kiss you too."
"We must make sure of that."
"I want to live my life."
"Ah, so that's it."
"How can you be here?"
"But I'll find out."
"Aren't you introducing us?"
"He threatened my family."
"Are you back already?"
"You've said enough."
"I was just making conversation."
"I know you know."
"For the good of all of us."
"How can I know?"
"I had two."
"I hired a detective."
"I called your house."
"Peace in the world?"
"I am a good man."
"I let her down."
"I take this seriously."
"Thy will be done."
"Do you want to come to my house?"
"You did your best."
"I was with someone."
"Where did you find this?"
"There are inscriptions."
"I almost believed it."
"I wanted to say thank you."
"So what's your plan?"
"See you up there."
"I'm happy for them."
"You don't like them?"
"I have my own business."
"Isn't it almost over?"
"Do you like Italian cuisine?"
"Can you wait a second?"
"He wanted money."
"Do you want to start again?"
"He's your little brother."
"I'll talk to him later."
"We should go now."
"Have you seen a doctor?"
"Yes, he is with me."
"Everyone relaxes."
"It's everyone's turn."
"You have some nerve."
"Isn't she beautiful?"
"You're in my head."
"It's good for me."
"Keep an eye on him."
"How many people on board?"
"Don't say otherwise."
"But in a good way."
"There is a step."
"Look how handsome he is."
"If only it were possible."
"I have to make a call."
"I'll take you to my place."
"What is he doing here?"
"That was the good news."
"You, what's your name?"
"I finished my work."
"Don't you like it?"
"Please stay."
"It's true love."
"I will tell him the truth."
"You're welcome, darling."
"I just wanted to be sure."
"You received orders."
"Do you want a piece?"
"You'll get another one."
"What do we do in the meantime?"
"I found a solution."
"And when is it?"
"You should see Mr. Leland."
"Try to remember that."
"You don't want it anymore?"
"Are you asking me to marry you?"
"Can I have some bacon?"
"He's good at it."
"I have a new idea."
"I said no."
"Call it what you will."
"They already know."
"How do I get out of here?"
"Sorry to arrive so late."
"He stopped breathing."
"Ticket, please."
"This is just the beginning."
"You're going to want to see this."
"She's in the truck."
"I'm going back to base."
"She opened her eyes."
"Do you have enough to pay?"
"Are you really going to do that?"
"I met a boy."
"Sounds like a plan."
"No, I promise you."
"I want one too."
"I'm taking him home."
"Maybe you too."
"Can we have a minute?"
"She gave it to me."
"Our prayers have been heard."
"It was supposed to be a surprise."
"Would you please shut up?"
"He is at the bank."
"Tell us where he is."
"We'll make sure of that."
"They will take care of it."
"Thanks for covering for me."
"This is for my brother."
"I'll pay you later."
"We're going to church."
"Can you give us a second?"
"The Ring is mine."
"We do as usual."
"I've got you, little one."
"I will make a report."
"You need him."
"I give you the choice."
"It looks like a little finger."
"I saw a light."
"She saw something."
"You must obey the rules."
"And what do you think about it?"
"Nice to meet you too."
"They never existed."
"Do you want to live with me?"
"Allow me to introduce myself."
"No, it's for you."
"Don't think about me."
"Oh, it is."
"Have you changed your hairstyle?"
"I can hear you very well."
"There are priorities."
"Do you have it on you?"
"I am proud of us."
"I got the message."
"It's your choice."
"I want to do something else."
"In less than an hour."
"Give me another one."
"Yes, I know that well."
"I've already found it."
"She says hello to you."
"Thank you for supporting me."
"The people love their king."
"A real pleasure."
"You have the power."
"Have you heard anything?"
"No one can see us."
"How are you going to do that?"
"And I'm grateful for that."
"You have a big heart."
"When did you discover it?"
"Just give me a second."
"It's open to everyone."
"You hadn't stopped?"
"I have something else planned."
"It's been a tough day."
"It's a beautiful gift."
"She was everything to him."
"I went out with him."
"I like them like that."
"Mom told me."
"You didn't do it."
"I've had it up to here."
"What will it be used for?"
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
"I can guarantee it."
"Will you give me a kiss?"
"Where did he go?"
"She's just a kid."
"No, don't."
"That's another one."
"I can't sing."
"But who is this guy?"
"He wants it for himself."
"I will take care of it."
"I am a good father."
"I have to try."
"He's behind all this."
"You are very late."
"Yes, it was one."
"That's life."
"Something is brewing."
"That's what intimacy is."
"It's all about you."
"All I know."
"She left a message."
"Of course, it's obvious."
"May I say a word?"
"It's in the bag."
"There is a choice."
"Yes, she's right there."
"Thanks, I'll take care of it."
"Doctor, please."
"Would you like to have dinner with me?"
"I don't have them anymore."
"But I feel better."
"Do you think you can do this?"
"You are my best friends."
"Let's see if it suits you."
"He's a good kid."
"Go ahead, tell me."
"I remember that too."
"I thought you were leaving."
"This is paradise."
"But yes, it's true."
"Do you remember me?"
"You have made a choice."
"What do you expect from us?"
"You should have known."
"I need protection."
"You are a true genius."
"Because we are friends."
"That's why you're here?"
"This is the only way."
"A real chatterbox."
"Because I like it."
"Is everything going as you want?"
"I know, it's incredible."
"I came by your place."
"I followed orders."
"You are the only one."
"Can you come for a minute?"
"Not like last time."
"I call it that."
"And what are you doing here?"
"Did you take anything?"
"Isn't that cute?"
"I didn't ask him."
"Where do we go from here?"
"Can we have an autograph?"
"It's not just him."
"It's your last day."
"You're late again."
"I'm in your camp."
"Can I go now?"
"I am open to suggestions."
"If you agree."
"Everything you know."
"No, I'm going home."
"The one and only."
"Can we talk for a second?"
"He was a wonderful man."
"Do you have anything better to offer?"
"Have you seen enough?"
"It could happen differently."
"What's the score?"
"It's been a long week."
"Calling all cars."
"How did she get there?"
"What time was it?"
"That's all they ask for."
"There are cops everywhere."
"Look at yourself in the mirror."
"I have a new friend."
"You don't want to answer?"
"I got used to it."
"Make room for me."
"That's a hell of a lot of money."
"How is your love life going?"
"He has company."
"Yes, how do you know?"
"What was I supposed to do?"
"Issue a wanted poster."
"I still have things to do."
"It was a great evening."
"So I'm going to do it."
"I have known you for a long time."
"I've seen them all."
"You did me a favor."
"I've never done any."
"So why did you do it?"
"He is a good student."
"What do you think about it?"
"Because you are you."
"God bless us all."
"Is it far from here?"
"Your attention, ladies and gentlemen."
"To be or not to be."
"I needed you."
"Do you really have to go?"
"What's down there?"
"I'm going to prepare something."
"Don't start with that."
"And you, where are you going?"
"I'll take you to him."
"That would explain a lot."
"Don't you want to eat?"
"It looks easy."
"Not about that."
"Do you love me a little?"
"Where can we find some?"
"Do I have to do this now?"
"I was just asking a question."
"What am I attracted to?"
"The only thing to do."
"But that's the past."
"It's a big thing."
"It's going to be something."
"Where did you get it?"
"Where did you get it?"
"I have to find my father."
"I promise you it won't."
"What more is needed?"
"Do you want to get shot?"
"Thank you for being so understanding."
"I have traveled the world."
"Take me to the hospital."
"Take me to a hospital."
"You can stay with us."
"We'll see each other again one day."
"It's for both of us."
"And he found it."
"We'll be right behind you."
"It is a sacred place."
"So where are we?"
"And who are they?"
"Did you think of me?"
"Put it on the table."
"Yeah, I think so."
"In the blink of an eye."
"They're coming for me."
"I prayed for you."
"Thank you, I will remember that."
"Does that answer your question?"
"Well, what are we talking about?"
"It must be for you."
"Who wants pizza?"
"Do you have water?"
"I would like to go home."
"I'm in the bedroom."
"We all have been."
"Pie in the morning?"
"I'm going to make a speech."
"I've never seen you."
"Your mother who loves you."
"Nice to see you."
"You have one."
"Someone needs to be warned."
"Down the street."
"But what are you going to do?"
"I had a wife."
"Yes, it's much better."
"I love you, my darling."
"It's her or me."
"Make room for him."
"That's a lot of people."
"Who is this woman?"
"What do you remember?"
"I'm happy for him."
"They went that way."
"It was the right time."
"We're going to do something."
"Can I open my eyes?"
"I'm starting to like it."
"Do you know TV series?"
"We are home."
"You, what are you doing here?"
"It was just to know."
"The city is ours."
"Are you going to do something?"
"Are you going to do something?"
"I found an apartment."
"Sheltered from what?"
"Does this bring back memories?"
"Several months ago."
"You don't know why?"
"Can I see your license plate?"
"Can I have some ice cream?"
"You promised me."
"We must stop them."
"Who is this jerk?"
"I was at the library."
"Yes, I will do that."
"You're driving me crazy."
"I want another opinion."
"Its forests and fields."
"Do you have a better plan?"
"You are a true gentleman."
"The door was wide open."
"Outside the city."
"He is an intelligent man."
"I had an affair."
"Don't think like that."
"It's just a glass."
"I'm going to go get dressed."
"Do you remember anything?"
"So what do we do now?"
"Does it have to be specific?"
"You're always late."
"Would you like to have dinner with us?"
"You understood very well."
"Do you remember him?"
"Yes, I want to marry you."
"I'll leave you for a moment."
"You know that, right?"
"I didn't go there."
"I got fed up."
"I do it anyway."
"You're a good friend."
"We found something."
"How long have you been working here?"
"Is that a life?"
"I was your only friend."
"This is my home."
"This is a normal reaction."
"I'll take two chickens."
"Yeah, I have to go."
"The calm before the storm."
"I met a guy."
"Is this a cell phone?"
"I don't think about it."
"What matters?"
"I'm going to get out of here."
"It seems to be working."
"You have to get out."
"I'll give you the address."
"What did you give him?"
"Is that what you call it?"
"Have you seen my keys?"
"It's better for her."
"That's the big question."
"What's going on?"
"Do you have anything to drink?"
"Take the next right."
"I remember you."
"What is your son's name?"
"She's perfect for you."
"And you, do you love him?"
"Tell me about your mother."
"Very kind of you."
"For me or for you?"
"Now it's too late."
"See you at the office."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Do you want me to sing?"
"He'll take care of it."
"You never understood."
"This is the only way out."
"It's a beautiful boat."
"This is the last day."
"The car papers."
"I have it somewhere."
"And what are you planning to do?"
"I thought you were joking."
"It really happened."
"Can I ask you why?"
"You need to know."
"It looks like it does."
"That's an idea."
"I'm going back to school."
"Everyone poops."
"Want to know something else?"
"It's worth it."
"It's better than before."
"I gave it to you."
"Can you repeat the question?"
"What do we do now?"
"You're a real tough guy."
"Take what you can."
"We can come back later."
"So, a little or a lot?"
"I said my goodbyes."
"Since when is it negotiable?"
"It's a beautiful watch."
"Do you have a copy?"
"I'll tell you how."
"I must do my duty."
"This had never happened to me."
"I have to tell you."
"So what do you want to do?"
"When can I see it?"
"She didn't say."
"I had a stroke."
"We took a detour."
"It is in good condition."
"Watch what you are doing."
"My name is Shawn Spencer."
"I think about it all the time."
"Do you want to come with us?"
"How did you get them?"
"I like this one."
"Allow me to withdraw."
"Could you be more specific?"
"Just a moment, I'll see."
"There is justice."
"It's not practical."
"A big one, is that it?"
"Please leave."
"You kept your promise."
"I think I know."
"Stay where you are."
"Glad you were there."
"You have a beautiful family."
"More than you can imagine."
"On my father's side."
"Thank you for doing it."
"I know where we're going."
"Who let him in?"
"I never wanted any."
"It's nice of you to call."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"This is my mother-in-law."
"I never could."
"I need an address."
"I'll give you some advice."
"Yes, that's the goal."
"Have you seen them before?"
"How did we get here?"
"Can I go too?"
"That's the truth."
"My father was like that."
"It's a Spanish name."
"I brought this for you."
"I brought you this."
"Do you know where he's going?"
"And did you like it?"
"You have to remember that."
"How did he get in here?"
"Butch, how do we look for him?"
"I will send you a check."
"He looks charming."
"Look what's happening."
"Can we go somewhere?"
"You heard the chief."
"It looks heavy."
"So far so good."
"I brought you here."
"Are you taking care of that?"
"Yes, it's himself."
"I made an oath."
"You deserve to be happy."
"Is he nice to you?"
"My feet are cold."
"There was a witness."
"You have to get used to it."
"She never existed."
"Not enough for my taste."
"I'll get my device."
"I was assaulted."
"What about blueberry pancakes?"
"It was really something."
"He's a private detective."
"He was my best friend."
"He is a busy man."
"Have a drink with me."
"Well, that's how it is."
"What are you talking about?"
"We got along very well."
"I'm new in town."
"Can I stay here?"
"Please get out of the car."
"Everyone came."
"How is he doing?"
"Maybe so."
"I have to eat something."
"And you, where are you?"
"I expected more."
"Give her my regards."
"Want to see the menu?"
"You don't speak English?"
"You came for nothing."
"All that work for nothing."
"No, it can't."
"Will you have everything tomorrow night?"
"Who took this photo?"
"Where did you find this?"
"Yes, I feel better."
"Please wait."
"I'll bring you a towel."
"How long does it last?"
"Nice talking to you."
"You have done your job."
"Don't call the police."
"Not a word to anyone."
"I heard it too."
"Take it as you wish."
"I shit myself."
"I was at university."
"I'm going to the hairdresser."
"But I'm fine now."
"Do you want to go home?"
"I called my mother."
"You always get away with it."
"What have I done now?"
"What is a pilot?"
"I saw you there."
"Can I call you James?"
"Yes, what is it for?"
"It's not yours."
"There are two possibilities."
"Isn't it yours?"
"We have half an hour."
"If we have the means."
"Don't close the door."
"I like it here."
"Who are our first competitors?"
"Isn't that something?"
"And you, do you love me?"
"And you want to know why?"
"Remember to breathe."
"What if I do this?"
"I have made a reservation."
"It was just a shortcut."
"I will cut across the fields."
"And I'll tell you."
"I'll be back as soon as possible."
"Just tell me the truth."
"Can I ride with you?"
"Thanks for bringing her back."
"Can I see your passport?"
"Have you ever thought about it?"
"Please excuse us for a moment."
"Did you hear the news?"
"I am a patient man."
"You have to see something."
"Glad you came."
"Can you open your eyes?"
"This is a good opportunity."
"They are our best friends."
"All lines are busy."
"You have company."
"He was a courageous man."
"Have you seen his eyes?"
"He is a good son."
"I don't speak German."
"They took everything from us."
"I have to catch my breath."
"It was good work."
"Can you lend us your garage?"
"I saw a girl."
"Do you still have your Malibu?"
"Thank you for this wonderful dinner."
"Nice to see you here."
"But promise me one thing."
"What did you answer him?"
"And we did it."
"Where are you from?"
"It's never good."
"I'm in a band."
"Did you find a topic?"
"There is only one solution."
"What am I supposed to do?"
"It's on my way."
"Is that his name?"
"Are you proud of me?"
"I should have been there."
"You can do that, right?"
"Because I was there."
"I'm here to work."
"I'm here to work."
"How did you get here?"
"Always the word to make you laugh."
"Why are you so interested in her?"
"I am in perfect health."
"I did you a favor."
"He is in the basement."
"I'm trying to relax."
"You look great."
"Do you want to get rid of it?"
"You are right, of course."
"You scare me."
"It happens all the time."
"You drink more than before."
"Can I see your license?"
"Nice to meet you."
"Since when have you been doing this?"
"I'm thinking of something."
"We will be safe there."
"You don't want to come?"
"He does whatever he wants."
"I'll be there tomorrow morning."
"Please, yes."
"It's fake."
"You are not her."
"I underestimated him."
"So there could be five of them?"
"I wondered why."
"You heard the captain."
"He shot him."
"Do you think the same thing?"
"Catch me if you can."
"It's a beautiful city."
"Isn't that good?"
"How can she do that?"
"He's a good little guy."
"This is a first draft."
"I'll explain it to you on the way."
"And how are we going to do it?"
"I don't have a father."
"No one can hear you."
"It's the jet lag."
"You helped me a lot."
"You shot him."
"He's a cool guy."
"We'll talk again later."
"Who takes care of you?"
"This time it will be different."
"Did you stay there long?"
"Do you need anything?"
"It's an old house."
"I have tons of them."
"Can you tell me?"
"Yeah, I did it."
"We just learned it."
"I'm on the street."
"Go get me a beer."
"You only think about that."
"You keep me informed."
"No, don't go."
"You didn't like him?"
"If it makes you happy."
"Who are you, anyway?"
"We take care of them."
"I received your letter."
"Let's talk in my office."
"Dad needs us."
"Yeah, you said it."
"You have to make a choice."
"I've always liked you."
"Welcome to base camp."
"I'm going to turn off the light."
"I will never see her again."
"But I need it."
"Did you see his eyes?"
"Let me take your bag."
"What was in it?"
"It is in a safe place."
"Why are you so calm?"
"That's enough, both of you."
"Yes, you will."
"Yes, it is very important."
"Yes, it's over there."
"How was the work?"
"I got this for you."
"Do you know who it was?"
"He came out from behind."
"Why are you sulking?"
"If you change your mind."
"I made two."
"You must leave and quickly."
"You won't get far."
"Do I owe you something?"
"We have to go get her."
"I wrote something."
"I swear I do."
"You can't imagine."
"What do you want from him?"
"I challenge you."
"So what are you talking about?"
"No, don't apologize."
"But what are we going to do?"
"Yes, he is there."
"I'm staying here with you."
"You just arrived."
"Can't it wait until tomorrow?"
"This is our new home."
"It was a great idea."
"Did you get to see it?"
"What is its origin?"
"We should go together."
"How can you think that?"
"He's still a baby."
"We're doing well, and you?"
"Great kings of Men."
"Yes, most of the time."
"I've never been here."
"You're leaving in an hour."
"I came to warn you."
"Who wants to live forever?"
"He was my grandfather."
"He's in the infirmary."
"Where do you want to start?"
"They are all the same."
"Let me introduce you to my wife."
"He was beside himself."
"And what about that?"
"When did you decide that?"
"Bring him home."
"Do you want to know?"
"I know a lot of people."
"Something is happening."
"I changed the locks."
"We would need a miracle."
"What are you doing with her?"
"Do you want a piece?"
"Haven't you seen it?"
"Many people do this."
"We should be able to work it out."
"So what did you do?"
"I'm leaving for good."
"I know where she lives."
"One bag, is that okay with you?"
"You are a real hero."
"She was a wonderful woman."
"I'm going to take pictures."
"The road is going to be long."
"As I expected."
"I'm shaking like a leaf."
"I'm going to see the others."
"It's a good lesson."
"Is this a new dress?"
"Have you read my diary?"
"He is abroad."
"It's over, guys."
"I'm going to the kitchen."
"I must have lost consciousness."
"Sounds exciting."
"It's a side effect."
"They were men once."
"It's all in the mind."
"What am I supposed to say?"
"A wonderful thing has happened."
"He taught me a lot."
"I only see you."
"He is talking to someone."
"I know who it was."
"I'm holding your hand."
"You'll never find her."
"Are you always like this?"
"You come home."
"Things have changed a lot."
"You have gained weight."
"She is capable of anything."
"Go to the other side."
"Nice to meet you too."
"You're going to wake the baby."
"Have you tried his cell phone?"
"Survival of the fittest."
"It was better than that."
"Of course he can."
"I was trying to protect her."
"What did you give me?"
"No, I'll stay with you."
"We must keep moving forward."
"Where should I start?"
"She's in my bag."
"Have you seen the news?"
"Where can we find it?"
"Where is your home?"
"You have a short memory."
"They won't know anything about it."
"I am his only family."
"Are you going out with Mia tomorrow?"
"Now I don't know."
"Did he have family?"
"No one can hear us."
"Did he come to your house?"
"Do they speak English there?"
"I am all yours."
"I'm taking the princess to lunch."
"You have to hold on."
"This is my secret garden."
"What is this book about?"
"Have you ever met him?"
"I heard gunshots."
"Yes, I have been."
"I think about you a lot."
"The miracle of life."
"It was last month."
"I am your grandmother."
"He was very brave."
"Haven't seen me for six months."
"You have to stop him."
"Do you put whiskey in it?"
"Do you know who he is?"
"No, where do they come from?"
"Call me whatever you want."
"He is in the tree."
"So, you said 'best intentions'?"
"Shall I bring you something?"
"I just received this."
"Where did you meet?"
"I'm going to the pharmacy."
"Who called the cops?"
"Get yourself a real job."
"He got caught."
"Of course, this is normal."
"Give us another chance."
"Because I'm here."
"Maybe it's here."
"I want to be with her."
"No point in trying."
"What is the dog's name?"
"I need to leave."
"Tell him to hurry up."
"I went to his house."
"My husband left me."
"I'm the victim."
"I had my eyes closed."
"What is this air?"
"I prefer not to answer."
"You are in charge."
"I'm not normal."
"How did you end up here?"
"This place is well protected."
"It means something to me."
"Another day, maybe."
"It's starting to show."
"I already know all that."
"Right next to you."
"I'll give you an example."
"Sorry, those are the orders."
"I like it like that."
"This is a serious question."
"I'm fine, I'm fine."
"But who are these guys?"
"This is the desired goal."
"I was just watching."
"He's just a boy."
"Here, it's yours."
"Yeah, it is."
"She's there, somewhere."
"What else does he say?"
"What are you doing?"
"Who is your dad?"
"Say goodbye to mom."
"I'll go find him."
"Can I have a drink?"
"This is a generous offer."
"Yes, you did."
"No, it's not nothing."
"He knows where she is."
"And you, where were you?"
"You'll have to follow us."
"She is a good mother."
"How do you know all this?"
"I know how to talk to him."
"Were you in the army?"
"Want to know more?"
"We're not breaking up."
"Sorry, we're late."
"And I found it."
"If I want to."
"It's just an exercise."
"No time to play."
"You heard your mother."
"I'll give you a price."
"How many chances do you have?"
"It's a good decision."
"She must not be far away."
"Right or left?"
"I swallowed the wrong way."
"What is the reason?"
"What am I paying you for?"
"I'll come as soon as possible."
"He's a nice guy."
"And that's very good."
"I did it myself."
"And what did you answer?"
"Actually, he's right."
"You have to stay."
"We're going to go there."
"I have to make a decision."
"You need to be more careful."
"Maybe we'll see each other again."
"Have a cup of tea."
"I'll give you a minute."
"I'll give you a minute."
"I'll get that for you."
"You have my sympathy."
"It wasn't the right time."
"She is in front of the house."
"Nothing can be proven."
"I needed her."
"She's good at it."
"That was last year."
"I want to know something."
"All this is mine."
"They are out of reach."
"And who will make them leave?"
"How am I going to explain this?"
"Can I have a word?"
"This is a wonderful idea."
"You have to do everything yourself."
"I left it there."
"As fast as you can."
"I can't find any."
"You look like an angel."
"I told him to get lost."
"He had that on him."
"Look what I'm doing."
"It was given to me."
"Who is the best?"
"But it's a good sign."
"What are you trying to prove?"
"Put your head back."
"Something like that."
"Something like that."
"I conducted my investigation."
"Did he say it?"
"Yeah, I'll do it."
"Have you been here before?"
"I can see it now."
"Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson."
"No, I don't dance."
"I'll get a blanket."
"It's a good title."
"I will pray for you."
"Are you taking drugs?"
"Can I use your restroom?"
"Is everything ready for tomorrow?"
"Have a good day at school."
"But it's different now."
"I want to know one thing."
"We need her."
"Who else but them?"
"That's the general idea."
"That's what family is all about."
"You are our only hope."
"Take all available men."
"Are you looking for company?"
"I'll make you an offer."
"All this has already happened."
"We've all been there."
"It looks great."
"We must keep moving forward."
"Don't you feel something?"
"It's an old building."
"You stay in the car."
"I'm on the ground."
"Who is on the case?"
"What have you done?"
"How did you meet her?"
"How did you meet her?"
"He will take care of you."
"He needs him."
"You have a lot of imagination."
"Please stay."
"Who does he work for?"
"Pocket money."
"I already have plans."
"He made me promise."
"Do you want to play with us?"
"Let's start by going down the hill."
"What is the code?"
"She decides."
"My work here is done."
"I never think about it."
"Is that you, my dear?"
"I thought she was with you."
"What did you hear?"
"Everyone sees it."
"You have to make a good impression."
"From your point of view."
"It never will be."
"It never will be."
"This is wonderful news."
"You're right, my dear."
"Very generous of you."
"He's just a baby."
"I do it for her."
"Yes, I have to do it."
"See you at the club."
"I am a new man."
"Oh, it's for me."
"It has already happened."
"Who would you like to speak to?"
"Did you call my wife?"
"I take care of the children."
"You are in good health."
"But you just arrived."
"On the way back."
"How far have you got?"
"I'm telling you, man."
"I'm going to the back."
"How do you know so much?"
"Tell me about your family."
"He is very lucky."
"Does she have a name?"
"It never worked."
"It's meat."
"I'll bring you a coffee."
"Who is entering my domain?"
"Now I'm sure of it."
"Your skin is so soft."
"I need medicine."
"I give you my card."
"But I can't anymore."
"I am near you."
"Did you see the shooter?"
"It's just business."
"The world is full of them."
"What time are you coming home?"
"You can use it."
"I'm resting a little."
"It's a beautiful country."
"He will never forgive me."
"I know the perfect place."
"A real bloodbath."
"Do you want to work with me?"
"I have a busy day."
"You are true friends."
"Your oath has been honored."
"It's a big event."
"I'll take care of them."
"How much will it cost me?"
"You have all the time in the world."
"As long as we're together."
"There is a body."
"Am I on air?"
"You are a fine blade."
"It's really hot in here."
"She was a strong woman."
"I love you guys."
"We found his car."
"What's your idea?"
"I don't know, Sergeant."
"Where are we going like this?"
"It's about you."
"And you're coming with me."
"Hide under the bed."
"Face the truth."
"Sorry about that."
"We have a new client."
"He's right behind us."
"What is it for you?"
"I went out with her."
"I'm asking you a favor."
"It's thanks to him."
"I need to breathe."
"Let's draw straws."
"It's a bit similar."
"I told you everything."
"You should have been there."
"How is it good?"
"I was just asking the question."
"The Community will dissolve."
"You don't look alike."
"Are we going to see a movie?"
"I speak to you as a friend."
"I need the answers."
"Tell me about your life."
"How did I get here?"
"Thank you for talking to us."
"Is this the right road?"
"Of course I knew."
"Nobody wants you."
"How are we going to do this?"
"Glad you're here."
"This is mine."
"Do you have proof?"
"Do you have proof?"
"And you trust him?"
"Where did you get that from?"
"Where did you get that from?"
"There is still hope."
"We have to make a decision."
"I betrayed you all."
"Merry Christmas, everyone."
"No one can know."
"It's going to be okay, darling."
"We're onto something."
"He needs rest."
"What's your name, kid?"
"I need an assistant."
"It will be worth it."
"See you later, girls."
"Thanks for keeping it."
"I know them by heart."
"He gets paid for it."
"I have a new band."
"Easy for you to say."
"It's on the table."
"Maybe he's sleeping."
"You don't follow them."
"Clothes make the man."
"You don't talk much."
"You have everything going for you."
"Have fun tonight."
"But I just arrived."
"He's just a kid."
"The bridge is very close."
"I live in the present."
"That's a challenge."
"I know the whole story."
"I know, it's great."
"Did you learn something?"
"I can't find it anymore."
"Stay with me for a while."
"When will he wake up?"
"We're going to have so much fun."
"Let me catch my breath."
"It was important to him."
"You need care."
"I would like to open an account."
"How is your lovely wife?"
"I would be very happy."
"You dare ask me that?"
"I hadn't decided anything."
"We were just talking about you."
"If I have time."
"Do what they say."
"It suits you very well."
"Where did you find it?"
"I went to the bathroom."
"I went to bed late."
"You better come."
"I was hoping to talk to you."
"Do you want to be my friend?"
"Put it on the table."
"It's not a chicken."
"I saw the tape."
"I didn't touch anything."
"Will I see you again one day?"
"She won't wake up."
"We're going to make a deal."
"Forever and ever."
"And what should I do?"
"He came towards me."
"How can I do this?"
"Who is this young girl?"
"You would never do that."
"Did I do something?"
"How much time do you have?"
"I'm good at this."
"They're going to have a baby."
"Because I like you."
"Wait for me at the hotel."
"Who do they think they are?"
"Does this mean anything to you?"
"Thank you for this wonderful evening."
"And that's the end."
"My mind was elsewhere."
"I knew who I was."
"I will give him the message."
"Don't let him in."
"And how do you feel?"
"Have you been working here for a long time?"
"I did my best."
"Have you ever been in love?"
"It's just a picture."
"I'm willing to do it."
"It's a new world."
"Everyone liked him."
"Nothing is ever certain."
"Take good care of him."
"And what about us in all this?"
"Can I get you one?"
"I know where to find some."
"No, that wouldn't work."
"It's always dark here."
"You stay home."
"What did you do with it?"
"But hearing is one thing."
"What did they tell you?"
"No, she's not here."
"She dreams of tender meat."
"You must be very proud."
"The United States of America."
"It must be for me."
"Do you want to add anything?"
"He's another man."
"This place scares me."
"Maybe it's you."
"The force of habit."
"I am the first to be surprised."
"The day has dawned."
"Do you still want me?"
"I'll read it to you."
"It's out of control."
"I'll get the newspaper."
"It's mine too."
"Do me a favor, will you?"
"It's oil."
"He is in his place."
"Would you like to have a drink?"
"I saw them together."
"I have free time."
"I never have any."
"They are good people."
"I wanted to go home."
"You're coming to my house."
"Do you still think about her?"
"You have to stay with me."
"I made a cake."
"Do you want to get out of here?"
"Please continue."
"What did your father say?"
"If that can reassure you."
"I want to be the first."
"It was in my pocket."
"I can read and write."
"It's mine now."
"It's almost over."
"I took my precautions."
"Do you see it like that?"
"No identity papers."
"Put her in the car."
"How long have you had it?"
"He passed by here."
"Did you find someone?"
"You are subpoenaed."
"What did you do to me?"
"I know how to judge people."
"And they disappear forever."
"You have to see something."
"So what are you going to do?"
"Luck is with us."
"Is that your name?"
"I wanted to say goodbye."
"My father and my mother."
"Can you open the door?"
"God bless you all."
"Are you going to eat all that?"
"I think I understand."
"Do you speak Na'vi?"
"There is an alternative."
"They need rest."
"See you at school."
"Can't we discuss this?"
"You have to get used to it."
"Where are you going, buddy?"
"I wanted to get some fresh air."
"I did this to you."
"Is that your advice?"
"They are all like that."
"Oh, I have an idea."
"And what is it?"
"I heard the news."
"You have to let him go."
"I asked you."
"Yes, yes, everything is fine."
"You have a beautiful house."
"Have a nice day to you too."
"You saw a child."
"This is your new home."
"How did you meet him?"
"Take a look at this."
"When did you do this?"
"This will all be over soon."
"That's what research is all about."
"And you, in all this?"
"Who did it, then?"
"Something is going to happen."
"What should I do about it?"
"Do something for me."
"I brought the money."
"I want to go there."
"You must tell the truth."
"No one really knows."
"Thanks, but it'll be fine."
"I choose."
"And now you are here."
"I'll write you a check."
"I told him yes."
"You have a beautiful voice."
"I would do anything for him."
"You should have told me."
"Is there a reward?"
"It's almost dawn."
"It will be our little secret."
"We have good news."
"But who cares?"
"How did he survive?"
"I'd better stay."
"There is a bed."
"I'll spare you the details."
"I try to be nice."
"Do you think you can get away with it?"
"Have you chosen a name?"
"First thing tomorrow."
"It's on the road."
"You both are."
"Do you have a pass?"
"She went too far."
"Let's get to the point."
"I have an idea."
"That is well said."
"You better speak up."
"How are things between you?"
"Can I have your name?"
"It's the fastest."
"Where is the next bridge?"
"I read your statement."
"You look different."
"No, he doesn't want to."
"It's to defend myself."
"I'm going to dance with her."
"I will never drink again."
"Do we really have to do this?"
"I know everything about him."
"I heard about it."
"Take me instead."
"I'm taking the next flight."
"This never happened."
"Where did I put it?"
"Are you coming home?"
"He looks different."
"No one saw us."
"The police will be here soon."
"Can you give me one?"
"Put it on speakerphone."
"I find you very beautiful."
"No, there aren't any."
"Give them my regards."
"I need a beer."
"Never heard of them."
"I didn't vote."
"It's English."
"I forgot my book."
"Who made this decision?"
"I have faith in you."
"I love you, Mom."
"That's a big word."
"You do it so well."
"She's mine now."
"Can I speak to the chief?"
"It's about money."
"You have made progress."
"What do you call this?"
"It was the only way."
"Have you ever felt this way?"
"I'm close to the goal."
"Coffee, please."
"Do you remember him?"
"I'll tell you later."
"He had enough."
"It's just a word."
"We have things in common."
"Tell me who I am."
"You ask me the question?"
"He's out of control."
"I didn't choose it."
"I'm going to do this right."
"I think he knows."
"It's part of you."
"You are his spitting image."
"How can you tell?"
"And you, do you know that?"
"I had a daughter."
"Maybe a little less."
"He sleeps soundly."
"Should I call my lawyer?"
"I do the same thing."
"What are you trying to do?"
"We still have a chance."
"This is for delivery."
"Where did you buy it?"
"I want to make an exchange."
"Good luck to you too."
"No, it will be fine like that."
"Where did you learn this?"
"Do you want to hear a story?"
"I would like to come with you."
"My son is with them."
"She has a date."
"I heard the explosion."
"I want to make things right."
"Come back in half an hour."
"You've crossed the line."
"As long as you're fine."
"I'm going to get some cigarettes."
"She's out of control."
"Are you sure?"
"There is a chest."
"I am his best friend."
"It was your father's."
"You need her."
"Do you want me to try?"
"Whatever she wants."
"Yes, we are aware."
"It will give you a souvenir."
"Are you having a good day?"
"Are you having a good day?"
"You are not serious."
"Let me see your eyes."
"What she did."
"It's a good hiding place."
"Did you like the movie?"
"I made a few calls."
"But I'll fix that."
"She is in a good mood."
"Are you ready for this?"
"What were you thinking?"
"Where did you put it?"
"Have a drink with us."
"I'll get the file."
"I'm going to see the cops."
"Yes, I have a question."
"What do you mean she's gone?"
"It's different for me."
"He needs air."
"Want to know more?"
"What do you say to that?"
"What did you answer him?"
"You still have a chance."
"I have a good ear."
"He's mine now."
"They will never find it."
"What does this have to do with my father?"
"Is this for me?"
"Did you have a vision?"
"Don't say another word."
"It's just a book."
"I wish I had one."
"Of course, I knew that."
"And one, two, three, four."
"Did I really do that?"
"I've seen a lot of them."
"How long have you known each other?"
"Where are you from?"
"What is the most important?"
"Everyone stays here."
"Do you want me to come back?"
"Do you want me to come back?"
"But where did he go?"
"How did you guess?"
"This is what we are."
"So you have the money?"
"What do you say to that?"
"It was part of the plan."
"I just did it."
"And you are part of it."
"Do as you please."
"I told you."
"He's a smooth talker."
"Can I get you something?"
"I was trying to protect him."
"Close the door when you leave."
"I wanted to give you this."
"Everyone is welcome."
"I'm going to the bank."
"No pun intended."
"I work all the time."
"That's the right word."
"They're making fun of me."
"I learned about it yesterday."
"I'll meet you downstairs."
"I'll meet you downstairs."
"She must be around there."
"Just a quick look."
"I have to go, Dad."
"But it's mine."
"You need to see a doctor."
"How do you know that?"
"I think I can."
"This is going to be headline news."
"What's yours?"
"Who are you exactly?"
"You are not human."
"I was going to call the police."
"I'll take them later."
"When can we see each other?"
"I have to go relieve myself."
"Put it in my car."
"Sorry we're late."
"It's morphine."
"Where is the score?"
"You tell yourself stories."
"He is an honest man."
"Come give me a hug."
"It's just an experience."
"I am so grateful to you."
"Ten years is a long time."
"It's a heavy load to carry."
"What are you doing here then?"
"What are you doing here then?"
"She was just a girl."
"How did you get it?"
"How did you get it?"
"What did you do after?"
"It's easy to find."
"What is this again?"
"Do you have another one?"
"They must be somewhere."
"Have you talked to mom?"
"She's bound to be out there somewhere."
"I already answered you."
"One day after another."
"I took a shortcut."
"Where did you hear that?"
"But it was a long time ago."
"Can I have some milk?"
"Call me back in an hour."
"It feels so good."
"Ask whoever you want."
"Did she tell you why?"
"I already have a family."
"It is loaded with blanks."
"See you at the station."
"Where did you meet him?"
"Go see for yourself."
"I read it too."
"I had never seen one."
"Let's start from the beginning."
"What if I'm right?"
"It looks comfortable."
"We're on the road."
"Where did they go?"
"I'm going to see the children."
"I'll play the game."
"I knew he would come."
"I've always had it."
"But where did she go?"
"I'll tell you."
"Is that the law?"
"Why did you say that?"
"Did you have a good trip?"
"It's an interesting choice."
"Do what is right."
"Even if I wanted to."
"You're fine like that."
"You didn't know him."
"What is this painting?"
"But you already knew that."
"Yes, my Precious, very kind."
"How did you do that?"
"And take care of yourself."
"Nor the guidance of missiles."
"Are you thinking about your family?"
"I'll give you the seat."
"It's him or us."
"I'm going to get you treated."
"He is in the subway."
"How did you come here?"
"But I can fix that."
"And how do you know that?"
"How are you, little one?"
"You'll need this."
"I got the job."
"Tell me you understand."
"How did you find out?"
"That is, us."
"I love you for that."
"We have proof."
"Don't ask me any questions."
"We have a past together."
"I'll get some ice cubes."
"It's up to you to say."
"He took it well."
"It's just work."
"I wanted to show you this."
"Do you trust me?"
"I'll give it a try."
"They say anything."
"Who's the boss?"
"Who's the boss?"
"They didn't come back."
"Yes, it's been a while."
"He's a double agent."
"Tell him who I am."
"You can open your eyes."
"Who do you think we are?"
"Sorry for calling so early."
"You owe me an apology."
"So, are you going to do it?"
"But where is he going?"
"I should go see her."
"It's all about timing."
"I want her to stay."
"I want him out."
"Not ours, his."
"You make a lovely couple."
"I am proof of that."
"Yes, thank you for coming."
"She didn't ask for anything."
"It's just a precaution."
"I'm just asking a question."
"I can't play."
"They take care of everything."
"My wife did it."
"I'll show you something."
"No, you didn't understand."
"Would you mind talking to me?"
"What do you remember?"
"So what is he doing here?"
"I paid your bail."
"This is a great song."
"His heart no longer beats."
"She has class."
"I am a single mother."
"It's time to intervene."
"I'll send you a car."
"Do you think I'm making this up?"
"Yes, yes, I understood."
"Everything was going so well."
"You are the strongest."
"Everyone wants that."
"We're on TV."
"Yes, I'm doing very well."
"I still don't see."
"You only think about yourself."
"I had a drink."
"What is he thinking?"
"And what did he say?"
"I have to get used to it."
"Are you in love with him?"
"It's starting to take shape."
"It's to protect you."
"Nobody asks you."
"Have you seen this girl?"
"I am a private detective."
"So take me with you."
"Call me back as soon as possible."
"I wish you long life."
"I owed you one."
"This is what he does."
"When will he be here?"
"Have you seen him recently?"
"How can you be here?"
"Don't just stand there."
"I need to see a doctor."
"I was never there."
"No, he has nothing."
"I should go to bed."
"I misjudged you."
"Maybe they'll come back."
"What name did you say?"
"It was taken from me."
"Did he come to see you?"
"Can I go to the toilet?"
"It's a family restaurant."
"I have some good news."
"Don't you want to dance?"
"I play the flute."
"I've never seen you."
"He is in a meeting."
"At the end of the month."
"I want to give it to you."
"Everything will be fine for her."
"You have half an hour."
"But maybe so."
"It's from my mother."
"I wish you would leave."
"It's happened before."
"The rest is mine."
"I went to his house."
"Are you together again?"
"We can do something else."
"We are the same person."
"Put everything on my tab."
"I liked it a lot."
"He's walking towards you."
"You let her go?"
"What if it happens again?"
"I'm going to go buy some."
"You have to tell him."
"I'll warn the others."
"Yeah, I figured as much."
"I let him in."
"Please answer."
"I won my bet."
"Where do we meet?"
"What if it's true?"
"Do you do weight training?"
"You are in perfect health."
"Are you coming to the party?"
"I didn't take them."
"Isn't she awesome?"
"You never say anything."
"It was just a party."
"So, we agree."
"Give it to us, my dear."
"May I know your name?"
"I need coffee."
"I do anything."
"That must feel good."
"She taught me a lot."
"I like simple things."
"And I like you."
"I will be by your side."
"Do you want to play tough?"
"Luckily I'm here."
"And I found it."
"I saw his car."
"Thank you for coming."
"What did we do?"
"What are you getting at?"
"Where are you going with this?"
"Who are we talking about?"
"Where were you last night?"
"I have another suggestion."
"The most powerful of the Nine."
"I felt the wind."
"You have to earn a living."
"Give me half an hour."
"Could you be more specific?"
"Isn't he handsome?"
"All right, here we are."
"I want us to talk."
"Who is your new friend?"
"We have to find a solution."
"If you would be so kind as to sign."
"Who do you think you're talking to?"
"What were you doing up there?"
"I told you about it."
"It's starting to be a lot."
"They are somewhere."
"It's going to take forever."
"And it was."
"It's going to be war."
"That's good, isn't it?"
"Who wins?"
"How dare you come here?"
"The boss wants to see you."
"The boss wants to see you."
"What are you saying?"
"What do we need?"
"Do you have anything to eat?"
"I need a phone."
"What is this book?"
"Where do you get them from?"
"Is that all you have?"
"It's okay, sweetie."
"I was just going to say that."
"We are one."
"He trusts you."
"Let me see your face."
"I hadn't seen it."
"No, she's mine."
"I'll go check that out."
"I forgot the lyrics."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Do you want more coffee?"
"She was nice to me."
"How long to repair?"
"Are you exercising?"
"Please answer the question."
"You are all welcome."
"He must have his reasons."
"This is definitely a good sign."
"What's your story?"
"I thought not."
"Wearing it for a while."
"Don't argue with me."
"You weren't expecting me?"
"So, I took it."
"You, me, everyone."
"They know where we are."
"They know where we are."
"When did you talk to him?"
"So how is she doing?"
"Goodbye, my old friend."
"It was a real pleasure."
"Please, man."
"What do you want to do with it?"
"The police are on their way."
"Didn't she tell you anything?"
"He's using you."
"I thought it was cute."
"Do you have gas?"
"This is our best option."
"It's in his head."
"What are we supposed to do?"
"You are not ready."
"This is important work."
"It's going to be all black."
"It's probably better this way."
"But what is it?"
"They all agree."
"I get to work."
"No news is good news."
"I'm fine, very fine."
"If only it could be true."
"It was an accident, right?"
"I am resourceful."
"It's supposed to be fun."
"What was this circus?"
"I have a new job."
"We should notify the police."
"Did you let him in?"
"She will never forgive me."
"I live with my parents."
"I'll get the champagne."
"I wish you the best."
"I'm just observing."
"Can I have a minute?"
"You're still the same."
"But then not at all."
"I would like to meet her."
"I like this one."
"What are we going to talk about?"
"Did you see it too?"
"You need care."
"You're not helping him."
"He means a lot to me."
"They are old friends."
"I'm taking her with me."
"He's a federal agent."
"Oh, I almost forgot."
"I am like the others."
"This place is familiar to me."
"I decided to come back."
"Can I be of use to you?"
"We have to find something."
"I want to watch TV."
"You have to trust him."
"What was school like?"
"There are pictures."
"And how do you feel?"
"I want to be sure."
"I am part of you."
"Say what you think."
"You should come with us."
"You can be proud of it."
"I am not beautiful."
"Take cover."
"I think I can do it."
"You'll listen to me, right?"
"How long this time?"
"Let me come with you."
"I want to hear your voice."
"Within reason."
"I could have done more."
"In the best case scenario."
"I arm all the pieces."
"We take care of our own."
"Where did you find them?"
"Everyone knew him."
"Come, I'll show you around."
"I have to talk to him now."
"You asked for it."
"I know where you are."
"Do you think that's enough?"
"You look great."
"You look great."
"He is trustworthy."
"You didn't come."
"Yes, but at what cost?"
"Call if needed."
"Let this stay between us."
"She wants me to leave."
"The design is very old."
"Now he's mine."
"It's starting to get hot."
"Just so you know."
"This is my boyfriend."
"I have to talk to you."
"You're a good father."
"I think about it every day."
"I am an American citizen."
"She wouldn't want to."
"Who did you have lunch with?"
"He looks great."
"I have a bunch of them."
"And now, what do we do?"
"Have you seen my daughter?"
"You won't believe it."
"I saw your mother."
"This is a direct order."
"If only I could."
"I'm the boss."
"This is the control center."
"I need to eat."
"What's going on?"
"Oh, that's so cute."
"This time I'll let it go."
"We enter the Vortex."
"So that's why."
"How is your grandmother?"
"He's one of them."
"I tried several times."
"That's what it's called."
"It's a big contract."
"I see a lot of things."
"Do you feel me inside you?"
"She was in the car."
"I want to find my family."
"Are you his girlfriend?"
"Isn't that right, Mr."
"Everyone can cook."
"Haven't you seen her?"
"Everyone believes it."
"Thank you for being my friend."
"I'm working on a case."
"That's life, huh?"
"You should be proud of it."
"I just want to talk to you."
"What did you do to them?"
"You will feel better afterward."
"That's all he does."
"We have a mutual friend."
"Are we going inside?"
"Where did you get it?"
"You should go see her."
"I got your text."
"Not a minute longer."
"We'll come get you."
"Come over here."
"It won't happen to us."
"Nobody touches anything."
"I'll get some champagne."
"It looks delicious."
"Madam, please."
"What's your name again?"
"How did you get in here?"
"Let them be ready."
"I don't want him."
"Thank you for coming here."
"Everyone knows them."
"It's glue."
"It's really well done."
"I'm leaving right now."
"His alibi holds water."
"I will do what is necessary."
"Can you give this to him?"
"No, it's yours."
"Did God tell you?"
"Thanks, I have to go."
"I will make it up to you."
"It's part of the show."
"Put this in the car."
"I played my part."
"So where are we?"
"Can you tell me why?"
"Both."
"Morning or evening?"
"This is serious."
"I'm going that way."
"He got me good."
"It was just a question."
"How can I believe you?"
"I want to see my family."
"You better get some sleep."
"There is a plane."
"He knows it very well."
"It's for business."
"We must turn the page."
"Come on, it's this way."
"I'm thinking of something else."
"Let's go back a little."
"Do you like ice cream, Doc?"
"She didn't want to."
"You can tell him."
"Can I have your number?"
"This one is for me."
"This one's for me."
"Are you at the hotel?"
"It was to protect you."
"We're on time."
"You have done your part."
"Does he know?"
"Who is everyone?"
"You know the saddest part?"
"You make me so happy."
"I don't do any."
"I need a plan."
"Is there anything else?"
"It looks brand new."
"I love baseball."
"I remember them."
"We have more than that."
"I'll let you go."
"That was the point, right?"
"No, no, it's nothing."
"I love another one."
"You should put on your seatbelt."
"I thought you might like it."
"Yes, we have one."
"Didn't you hear me?"
"Did you come to see me?"
"I got your letter."
"He is a beautiful dog."
"You are more than that."
"It belonged to my mother."
"It's a bit premature."
"I have to call my father."
"Where will he go?"
"Can I have some tea?"
"A good night's sleep."
"It was just a dream."
"Will you keep me informed?"
"I'm going to the shower."
"We changed our minds."
"That sounds like a good idea."
"I don't want them."
"I love you, old man."
"I didn't learn anything."
"This is the perfect place."
"We'll get along well."
"I'll take your coat."
"He is in the morgue."
"He's good somewhere."
"You need to regain your strength."
"You're on the list."
"I left it there."
"It's so quiet here."
"Do you want to play the hero?"
"Because it's awesome."
"I'll get the other one."
"She has value."
"What's your plan?"
"Nothing beats the present."
"Anyone can enter."
"I just want to see her."
"What is this then?"
"She jumped on me."
"Have you ever been in love?"
"Have you ever been in love?"
"What did you just do?"
"He showed it to me."
"Have you known this for a long time?"
"She is in love with me."
"Did you hear the news?"
"How did you get here?"
"Yeah, that's not going to happen."
"I would like to go there."
"Do you know where I am?"
"Do you want a drink?"
"I'll do it on my own."
"Can you wait a minute?"
"Good luck to all of us."
"You have to believe so."
"I am with clients."
"Let me take a look."
"There are several possibilities."
"How do you see it?"
"What was going to happen?"
"I just want some information."
"I'm taking this case off your hands."
"They always have been."
"Where did the money come from?"
"We have all day."
"No, it's too long."
"You had no right."
"How can I find it?"
"You will find another one."
"That's very good."
"What's your name, kid?"
"I don't play anything."
"What is this voice?"
"You are a true friend."
"Nobody ever says anything to me."
"You're going to want to see this."
"She likes to eat like this."
"I need action."
"They're after me."
"Nine years ago."
"I love it too."
"When did you decide that?"
"Is this vodka?"
"But he's your father."
"You started without me."
"Did she say why?"
"You won't know."
"And how is he?"
"Did you really say that?"
"I made some tea."
"And that scares me."
"Do you want me to leave?"
"We made love."
"I have to leave you."
"Talk to your father about it."
"What is he playing at?"
"All right, you know what?"
"I'm very proud of it."
"What was the idea?"
"I don't work there anymore."
"It's just a song."
"Yeah, something like that."
"I didn't dare."
"They know who you are."
"I drink to your health."
"That's so nicely asked."
"They are coming straight towards us."
"Have you talked to Dad?"
"We'll make him pay."
"Let me make it up to you."
"A minute ago."
"Thank you for being honest."
"Did you see his look?"
"Do you want to go swimming?"
"He is an excellent doctor."
"Dad, what are you doing here?"
"Are you blocked or what?"
"I live with my father."
"Where have the people gone?"
"He looks cool."
"Put it on speakerphone."
"How is she doing?"
"Can I have something to drink?"
"This happened to you."
"Nice to meet you."
"It's a beautiful view."
"The cops are on their way."
"Was I unconscious for a long time?"
"We all have been."
"I really need to talk to you."
"Anything goes."
"We will take care of him."
"You heard perfectly."
"Return to the starting point."
"Listen, I have an idea."
"This is not normal."
"What time do you finish?"
"I'll leave the door open."
"I want to see the mountains again."
"Tell my father."
"He is on the ground."
"Will you be my wife?"
"I'll take one."
"I'll stay for a while."
"You heard your father."
"It can last a while."
"He brought me here."
"Don't think about it anymore."
"It's the American dream."
"Your life is at stake."
"Did you enjoy the show?"
"The trail ends here."
"You are not him."
"I know them very well."
"Go see who it is."
"I strive to be perfect."
"I already know that."
"I'll fix all this."
"We'll be back in a moment."
"Yes, but you know what?"
"I'll go ask him."
"I don't want to."
"I love musicals."
"I'll go get some."
"Isn't she charming?"
"This is partly true."
"Because I know him."
"You are in my way."
"What are these people doing here?"
"I always felt it."
"You need rest."
"You do this very well."
"I'll bring some water."
"They don't talk to each other."
"No, we have to go."
"He's a man now."
"Glad you stopped by."
"I signed for you."
"We already have one."
"I'm coming from the hospital."
"He is in my class."
"What are you trying to prove?"
"Do you like baseball?"
"Nice to see you."
"That would be wise, my friend."
"No, I don't care."
"It must be fate."
"Someone who loves you."
"I'm made for this."
"You look happy."
"I would do the same for you."
"Would you like something?"
"I've had my share."
"No, I'm a better rider."
"She is really very beautiful."
"This will not happen."
"I need support."
"How long have you known her?"
"Look, I'll show you."
"Yeah, that's how it is."
"It's his livelihood."
"Did they take something?"
"I found a job."
"As long as you want."
"We're going to do something else."
"You're no better."
"And I found this."
"No, we just arrived."
"Who's the new guy?"
"Do you have music?"
"I will let him know."
"We all agreed."
"How could I do it?"
"We are in space."
"I have to see this."
"We have to go somewhere."
"You are a good woman."
"Have you seen this boy?"
"I'm talking into the void."
"What's the catch?"
"A gift from my mother."
"I will make an effort."
"You are hiding something from us."
"I'm doing this for her."
"I just remembered."
"And now, what do I do?"
"Don't you ever think about it?"
"But I have a family."
"Don't you miss me?"
"I saw the car."
"Stand up straight."
"She's around here."
"I'm broke."
"Open the glove compartment."
"I have friends there."
"Milk and sugar?"
"Tell me about your mother."
"That's the idea, yes."
"Do you want to play with me?"
"That's true, actually."
"I told you so."
"They didn't think."
"What is it for you?"
"Half a million dollars."
"No, I'm not staying."
"How did you meet her?"
"You still have friends."
"I'm going to call a doctor."
"I need the money."
"Do you think I should?"
"Do you think I should?"
"Can you be more specific?"
"See you at noon."
"I had you followed."
"Yes, he is mine."
"Yes, I like them."
"It's a great pleasure."
"You were very kind."
"What if it's him?"
"What do you want to do there?"
"But there are some."
"Everything looks good."
"Thank you for choosing us."
"I'll find you some."
"This is what you do."
"I really believed it."
"I'm just passing through."
"Eight months ago."
"I can't read."
"Where are you going so fast?"
"Who is this guy?"
"I didn't order this."
"So I did it."
"And what does it consist of?"
"But not every day."
"He's the boss."
"What is this light?"
"We should go to class."
"They just talk."
"You owe me something."
"What's up, girls?"
"See what's happening."
"You must not leave."
"Everyone is different."
"You have to give him credit for that."
"I'll give you my address."
"Thank you all very much."
"How many do you need?"
"Please wait."
"She is in the living room."
"We'll keep you posted."
"I'll give it to him."
"That's a great idea."
"It's been half an hour."
"Please come out."
"You are better than them."
"I wish you a good trip."
"What is this car?"
"This is my favorite book."
"Can I take your coat?"
"I have to do it now."
"No, I won't say anything."
"She is an extraordinary woman."
"We must continue to search."
"You're coming with us."
"This is what I see."
"Well, that's very good."
"Would you like a drink?"
"Take care of your mother."
"It's just a test."
"I mean, who knows?"
"I've never taken any."
"Are you done playing?"
"I need care."
"It's the same for us."
"I have something to eat."
"Can we do something?"
"I really did it."
"I have just been warned."
"I would like some water."
"It comes from below."
"It's going to be yours."
"What are you looking for, exactly?"
"You are an amazing woman."
"So why did you come?"
"Who is responsible for this?"
"We are very proud of it."
"I'll take it later."
"I searched on Google."
"We had coffee."
"I have to do something."
"He can afford it."
"Do you want to go to the movies?"
"Because it's right."
"The bar is over there."
"Thank you for asking the question."
"It's in your nature."
"This is an interesting offer."
"What is your daughter's name?"
"I saw his look."
"No, no, it'll be fine."
"You do it very well."
"He always knew it."
"Every day of my life."
"I heard my name."
"What year is it?"
"This is what we know."
"It was you, wasn't it?"
"That's good, my dog."
"She gets that from me."
"I agree."
"Did you see a little?"
"Wait, what's this?"
"I should have believed you."
"Face it."
"You have good eyes."
"Can I have his number?"
"The seven CEOs of Tobacco."
"Maybe he is."
"A little more than that."
"My whole life is here."
"I'll buy you a drink."
"I go to the gym."
"You are a pufferfish."
"Father, I beg you."
"We need answers."
"Women and children?"
"I visited him."
"How did she know?"
"You don't answer me."
"Day and night."
"Where is my camera?"
"What do you have against me?"
"Do you want to turn around?"
"You are a woman now."
"Now we can go."
"What is this costume?"
"Have you seen this guy?"
"How can you eat that?"
"Is it raining?"
"It's a fixed idea."
"You're not even trying."
"He is in Los Angeles."
"And yes, I want to play."
"Family is important."
"I'm going to the morgue."
"I work at the hospital."
"It was an honor."
"I can't pay."
"Do you know who he is?"
"Do you think you can do it?"
"She got you good."
"I'm happy for her."
"I'm in the middle of a conversation."
"The investigation is ongoing."
"Isn't he charming?"
"We're having a boy."
"I learned like that."
"Let me do my job."
"I did my job."
"This is a good thing."
"Have you seen my brother?"
"You did your part."
"You look like it."
"Of course, who else?"
"I'll send you a photo."
"I make them myself."
"He shits his pants."
"I have never played."
"And that's it, it's over."
"Are you going to stay with me?"
"Who else lives here?"
"Is he the Worm?"
"He rolls the ship."
"It's just a fact."
"It's an old map."
"I'm going to have fun."
"You are cleared for takeoff."
"And what did it give?"
"I know how it's done."
"It's to protect you."
"And I met you."
"That's business."
"What do you want in return?"
"I was on the island."
"You almost had me."
"It's my home too."
"This is an incredible opportunity."
"It's much easier."
"Can you give me a minute?"
"Can I have more?"
"What school do you go to?"
"Only you remain."
"He has a future."
"I'm going to the bedroom."
"What is this thing?"
"Isn't that cool?"
"Who was this guy?"
"Did you call the police?"
"All men are."
"You betrayed my trust."
"Where is this dress from?"
"There's also that."
"I don't read them."
"You'll feel better."
"I have to say no."
"I spoke with him."
"I ask you nicely."
"You like him, don't you?"
"You don't see her?"
"Your secret will be well kept."
"Your secret will be well kept."
"Yes, you can go."
"Yes, you can go."
"And that doesn't bother you?"
"There is the kitchen."
"Do we have a choice?"
"Can I speak frankly to you?"
"You have to leave the city."
"This is the captain."
"I am well aware of that."
"Can I have one?"
"We are in front of the entrance."
"Did he say his name?"
"Maybe it was me."
"I saw your face."
"Where did the money go?"
"Do you have any other ideas?"
"I'm in the garage."
"Your face is familiar to me."
"Did you do the job?"
"You could have said so."
"The big moment has arrived."
"You're always late."
"It was your mother's."
"And now what do I do?"
"I can't leave her."
"I am a housewife."
"It is a proven fact."
"It's a beautiful costume."
"Where is the other car?"
"We can say that, yes."
"What's the news?"
"Did you say something?"
"Four months ago."
"I didn't wake up."
"I am a cleaning lady."
"It's so beautiful here."
"Put it in your pocket."
"You call this love?"
"I imagined you to be taller."
"But we did it."
"What if we went there?"
"Did you take any pictures?"
"All right, that's it."
"Come on, let's have fun."
"Why did you come here?"
"Why did you come here?"
"The door opened."
"Very kind of you."
"It's heroin."
"The trees will come back to live here."
"Aren't you exaggerating a little?"
"Your father wants to talk to you."
"He was in love with me."
"I've already called them."
"Not even by their mother."
"That's kind of true."
"What will people think?"
"We have to find something."
"It's natural selection."
"What is your first name?"
"Do you remember anything?"
"You were very brave."
"The rest is up to you."
"You forgot a place."
"Are you asking me?"
"Who are you supposed to be?"
"Tell them to hurry up."
"Have you been there yet?"
"Everyone is there."
"We can do both."
"What did you tell me?"
"Where can I find you?"
"Sorry, what did you say?"
"They are all so beautiful."
"What did you want to show me?"
"It's a dressy evening."
"Listen, I have to go."
"This is a great opportunity."
"Who wouldn't want that?"
"All right, that's settled."
"Maybe next year."
"You must make an appointment."
"On the contrary, it's perfect."
"What else do you do?"
"He's a smart guy."
"Do you have any experience?"
"He is a lucky man."
"I just want to talk to you."
"Do you believe in reincarnation?"
"Where do you get that from?"
"Are you going to take care of it?"
"I am a good citizen."
"What will happen to him?"
"There were plenty of them."
"I just received it."
"Take good care of yourself."
"What did we do?"
"Nice to see you again."
"When the time comes."
"Glad you were there."
"I owe him an apology."
"You are not God."
"You are not God."
"What is this movie?"
"Do you live near here?"
"Do you live near here?"
"We will know more tomorrow."
"It's mine too."
"I'm trying to concentrate."
"Is it going as you want?"
"How are you doing?"
"Tell us where you are."
"No, I have an appointment."
"I want you to look."
"Is this your first visit?"
"What's it like there?"
"I take care of myself."
"Yes, that's for sure."
"Yeah, I saw that."
"What is it made of?"
"Maybe more than that."
"It will be better tomorrow morning."
"Maybe we're there."
"How much did you pay for it?"
"You have the right to do so."
"Are we going up or down?"
"I noticed it."
"I see things differently."
"Beyond, another dimension."
"I will remember you."
"This is the case now."
"The whole town knows it."
"I brush my teeth."
"What did you do to them?"
"Did you enjoy yourself?"
"The man in the street."
"I understand you very well."
"I signed the papers."
"It is a registered trademark."
"Home to amazing things."
"Are you having a good evening?"
"There is one thing you should know."
"He trusts you."
"It's true, I know."
"Have you lived here long?"
"What do we owe the honor?"
"This is my favorite dish."
"That's reason enough."
"She never will be."
"I just want to protect you."
"I shot him."
"But yes, you know it."
"Give me your news."
"Give me some news."
"I saw the file."
"That's what friendship is."
"On the ground, face down."
"Listen to me for once."
"You passed the test."
"That's enough for now."
"We'll talk about it again tonight."
"Do you remember it now?"
"Who is this pretty girl?"
"You don't do them."
"I knew him well."
"How much did you drink?"
"You look stressed."
"She was a wonderful woman."
"I thought about that too."
"I've often thought about it."
"You better back off."
"Can you say the same?"
"Have you never been there?"
"I voted for him."
"I came to talk to you."
"It's pure."
"Since always and forever."
"But who did this?"
"We are good people."
"I've always been here."
"They are in the car."
"They are in the car."
"It was his first time."
"This is what I want."
"We can still do it."
"I have gold."
"I'll bring you some tea."
"What was the honor?"
"I join you."
"What is this language?"
"I love you, my heart."
"The man I was looking for."
"Can I use the phone?"
"I'll get a vase."
"That's all, guys."
"Where is your girlfriend?"
"I just made some."
"May God be with us."
"The fishing was good."
"I have to put an end to this."
"I already told you."
"I haven't even started."
"You look very beautiful."
"I took action."
"There was a word."
"She takes care of me."
"I made a deal."
"You do as you wish."
"You still have a choice."
"Are you from the police?"
"Good to see you, man."
"I know how you are."
"I'll let you discuss."
"I heard your voice."
"We'll have to go."
"This is our greatest asset."
"Do you play an instrument?"
"She was a beautiful woman."
"I want to see you smile again."
"Have you been drinking or something?"
"It's D-day."
"I understood something."
"I need to change."
"Some time ago."
"I want one too."
"Take some rest."
"I have to go shopping."
"Let's be clear."
"I'm going to sell the house."
"I will write it to you."
"Yes, you said it."
"Do you want to go to bed?"
"Maybe not for you."
"She didn't know."
"He's a great guy."
"I witnessed it."
"How did you find me?"
"It's just a tip."
"How many did you take?"
"A day like any other."
"I like this guy."
"You know, he's right."
"Do you want to come?"
"It comes from within."
"Not if we stay loyal."
"You look busy."
"It's really very pretty."
"I need the keys."
"We have men everywhere."
"I'll take a look at it."
"I can guarantee it."
"The craftsmanship is excellent."
"Would you like something to drink?"
"I don't know what to think."
"What are you doing later?"
"It's time to play."
"Just answer the question."
"She is in good health."
"I want to go out with you."
"She's coming to see you."
"Would you like to take a tour?"
"The meal is almost ready."
"I want to stay with him."
"I came back for you."
"I am a secret agent."
"I was being funny."
"What are you doing in there?"
"Maybe you should have."
"Do you have any food?"
"And what do we have here?"
"I'll see you later."
"This is my favorite moment."
"Or whatever."
"It's a beautiful country."
"I'll find something else."
"I have to see the doctor."
"Would you like to come with me?"
"I didn't accept."
"I drank a little."
"He's the spitting image of you."
"Don't answer that."
"Don't answer that."
"She has a lot of talent."
"And at that time?"
"We'll come get you."
"I think they're coming."
"How long will it last?"
"I served my country."
"What am I going to do now?"
"They had other plans."
"I needed him."
"I thought she was asleep."
"I know everything about him."
"Yes, I found it."
"I am the rightful king."
"Have you spoken to him about it?"
"She won't be there."
"Tell your friends."
"The voices of our ancestors."
"It's probably better this way."
"I'm getting out of here."
"When did you arrive here?"
"What are you getting involved in?"
"What could he have done?"
"Look what she's doing."
"I packed my bags."
"The rest is up to you."
"But it could be."
"Yes, we have one."
"I want to see your eyes."
"I know how he is."
"It was my first mission."
"But it's very good."
"I hope you will come."
"This money is mine."
"It lasted for a while."
"What's new for you?"
"You can do that, right?"
"I just wanted to see you."
"Sorry for waking you up."
"Who can do something?"
"Do your parents know?"
"So, what do you think?"
"So, what do you think?"
"I'm going to get some candles."
"We have to go that way."
"The Ring has awakened."
"How did you learn it?"
"So you have a choice."
"Do you know where I'm going?"
"Where can I reach him?"
"You know everything about me."
"We should all do it."
"You are the doctor."
"Well, where were we?"
"Who will take care of it?"
"I have it online."
"That must mean no."
"We'll see you tomorrow morning."
"Do you want to stay with me?"
"Do the right thing."
"I saw you taller."
"Everyone is hungry."
"She looked good."
"He's here somewhere."
"We are a good team."
"Just a little further."
"I have been watching you for a long time."
"It will change your life."
"No ID."
"If you wish."
"But what is the connection?"
"It just works."
"A work of art, truly."
"Go ahead for me."
"You don't talk to each other?"
"I'll do it for you."
"We'll talk about that tomorrow."
"I'll pour us a drink."
"He had a stroke."
"Good luck, everyone."
"Compliments of the chef."
"I don't know anything else."
"But we can fix that."
"She has a sense of humor."
"It's up to you to say."
"I have this for you."
"What's in your eyes?"
"One day and one night."
"I can't choose."
"It costs money."
"It's a good mobile."
"I would do it myself."
"We did it together."
"They are not there."
"It should be possible."
"How much did it cost?"
"I'm going back to the hotel."
"Where did you take him?"
"This is witchcraft."
"I have to call my wife."
"I found it there."
"What exactly are you doing?"
"It's a beautiful room."
"Take him back to his cell."
"It makes me so happy."
"You better come."
"Both at the same time."
"Pretty much."
"Can I borrow your phone?"
"I would have liked to meet her."
"I put it there."
"I am an honest man."
"She is the most beautiful."
"I was lucky."
"You are always with me."
"You never called."
"I would be grateful."
"I'll do it on my own."
"So how did it go?"
"There is the account."
"The village gets up early."
"Can you wait a second?"
"It's politeness."
"Her maiden name?"
"I'm going to bed."
"I need reinforcements."
"Oh, of course I do."
"Above your head."
"This is what I was waiting for."
"I will take his place."
"I want to make a deal."
"Did he talk to you?"
"They took it from me."
"Were you in the army?"
"Who tells you otherwise?"
"Because you know what?"
"I earn a good living."
"Let me take a look."
"And who is she?"
"No, don't tell me anything."
"Welcome to your new body."
"He was a good guy."
"Someone to talk to."
"The past is behind us."
"The others, come with me."
"How does this affect you?"
"They don't speak English."
"Where is the rebel base?"
"No firearms."
"He looks harmless."
"Can we do this now?"
"I have another surprise."
"Now it's our turn."
"I wasn't finished."
"Is she dating someone?"
"As you requested."
"How could this happen?"
"Put this in your ear."
"What if we are seen?"
"You move forward."
"Are you going to see him?"
"Up the hill."
"She looks good."
"Everyone stops."
"I need a bag."
"What happens to them?"
"Not because of you."
"What if they do?"
"What do I do with him?"
"He is really very good."
"It sounds romantic."
"I taught him that."
"Are you coming or are you staying?"
"Was he your boyfriend?"
"I think I do too."
"It's happened before."
"I'll bring you something to eat."
"You should go rest."
"Shall we put on some music?"
"I come from the street."
"I can't go anywhere."
"What are you playing at?"
"Did I say otherwise?"
"I'm ready to talk."
"Tomorrow we get up early."
"Do you want her to come?"
"Do you know where we are?"
"Here, please."
"I got fucked."
"I've been thinking about it for a long time."
"It makes him feel good."
"Shall I bring you something?"
"Just a little longer."
"You remind me of your father."
"They are in the back."
"Do I have to sign something?"
"And where are we going?"
"So, did you like it?"
"What did the doctors say?"
"She needed money."
"He's just a man."
"Or something like that."
"No, it's my turn."
"Are you inviting me to dinner?"
"Thank you for replacing me."
"You are in my place."
"He was with a girl."
"He comes from the right."
"Because you love it."
"I take my hat off to you."
"We take care of everything."
"I opened my eyes."
"Someone has to stay here."
"We both know that."
"You look great together."
"Can you get me a drink?"
"How is she doing?"
"Would you excuse us for a minute?"
"They make a beautiful couple."
"She will never know."
"Reason about what?"
"I've had it forever."
"You don't work here anymore."
"Pour me another one."
"How pregnant are you?"
"I called a taxi."
"Do we have to do this now?"
"Where were you thinking?"
"You're safe now."
"You don't recognize me anymore?"
"Do you think she knows?"
"Please answer."
"This is my favorite drink."
"Where were you raised?"
"Do you want to do it?"
"He was one of us."
"Nice to have met you."
"Did she say all that?"
"It is an established fact."
"Go brush your teeth."
"He looks better."
"Thanks for last night."
"No one can hear you."
"Can you come for a moment?"
"You have a nice garden."
"What color are they?"
"It was a beautiful speech."
"What are you going to do with it?"
"You know."
"I found it here."
"This is a new model."
"You look fantastic."
"I stopped him."
"How is that fair?"
"Meat on wheels."
"Did you see the shooter?"
"Have you made your decision?"
"It's in my bag."
"Why did you come then?"
"What is your friend's name?"
"I went to see him."
"But my decision is made."
"I understood one thing."
"I need a room."
"I went for a walk."
"Thank you for everything."
"Is this a real question?"
"I'm going to make a toast."
"And where are we going?"
"He is with us now."
"How did you get out of it?"
"She is in intensive care."
"What is your job?"
"You need a lawyer."
"I came for you."
"Did you find anything else?"
"Did you find anything else?"
"Do you want to get out of here?"
"Bachelor party."
"Do you have a better plan?"
"Do you want to see his picture?"
"Where can I find them?"
"It's in three days."
"I am not homosexual."
"Have you seen a doctor?"
"You heard the gentleman."
"This is a huge opportunity."
"You're scaring me."
"There was a reason."
"Because he is."
"Sit on my throne."
"I did the math."
"But where did he go?"
"Another one did it."
"As if you knew."
"I was hoping to find you here."
"I like the idea."
"I don't speak Russian."
"I forgot the number."
"Where did you see her?"
"Come down, please."
"You have until tomorrow."
"I am sane."
"She was no longer there."
"I will always be your friend."
"I will be grateful to you."
"Who said anything about money?"
"You should ask him."
"He was a good agent."
"Make yourself comfortable."
"In that case, good night."
"I'm one of the good guys."
"I'm going to take the subway."
"You must be very busy."
"No one saw him again."
"He should be fine."
"I have some on me."
"Would you listen to me?"
"Don't let him down."
"How do you know his name?"
"How do you know his name?"
"I need details."
"I have never danced."
"No, I don't have."
"We saw each other yesterday."
"Isn't it good?"
"Have you seen my son?"
"If you have time."
"Dad, did you see that?"
"I would really like to know."
"Remember who you are."
"Who wants to take his place?"
"It's not a word."
"Can you turn off the light?"
"It's up to you."
"She's on the plane."
"I'm starting to like him."
"And what do you plan to do?"
"It's for a few days."
"He was a human being."
"I made some changes."
"They will never find us."
"I have a good teacher."
"It's for something else."
"Hide under the stairs."
"But that's something else."
"I almost forgot it."
"You have to meet her, Kara."
"I arrived this morning."
"I have an idea."
"I am open to everything."
"No, it's my idea."
"You are a good person."
"Haven't you noticed?"
"His gaze was caught."
"Do you think you can do it?"
"You don't listen to the radio?"
"Can we leave here?"
"I know how to manage on my own."
"Of course not."
"You're just a kid."
"Let's postpone this."
"Have you told me everything?"
"Just like in real life."
"His life is at stake."
"You should have stayed there."
"Believe me, it's true."
"He takes care of me."
"There is trouble."
"So you're going to do it?"
"And everything will be fine."
"But you can do it."
"You shouldn't have come."
"Yes, it feels good."
"Thank God you are well."
"You helped us a lot."
"Yes, I'll get her."
"I'm going to my office."
"Please continue."
"You are better than me."
"A family member."
"I saw his mother."
"Everyone wants it."
"It has to lead somewhere."
"What do you plan to do with it?"
"Family comes first."
"She would do anything for you."
"I explained everything to him."
"It could take days."
"Glad you came."
"I should have said it."
"Just tell me one thing."
"And it is very powerful."
"I wrote a poem."
"We got rid of it."
"He let me go."
"We got spotted."
"I have it in my sights."
"I am part of the scenery."
"What is the message?"
"I have friends here."
"You did me a favor."
"I did the calculations."
"No, no, it's good."
"I have a lot of work."
"I was just checking."
"I am the same person."
"How did they get it?"
"But where is the world going?"
"He said yes."
"Aren't you thirsty?"
"You're imagining things."
"Thank you, it's very beautiful."
"The cops got him."
"We must keep moving forward."
"You have to try."
"You almost had me."
"Did he come to see you?"
"It was the right choice."
"Isn't he great?"
"Let me do my job."
"Tell him anything."
"What I had to do."
"You don't want it?"
"I'll have to leave you."
"I need sugar."
"How will it end?"
"It's just words."
"No, we shouldn't."
"That is, you."
"The witness has rights."
"I have to stop him."
"You have to live your life."
"Who are you, anyway?"
"He has personality."
"And what did you do?"
"You are full of surprises."
"But you have to believe me."
"Should I draw you a picture?"
"The world is really small."
"We met yesterday."
"What are we going to do with it?"
"What can we do about it?"
"So, did you find it?"
"Can I touch your hair?"
"I forgot my text."
"You're a little late."
"I see light."
"No, you have to listen to me."
"How many did you eat?"
"This is my point of view."
"Can this stay between us?"
"Because he loves you."
"I know you by heart."
"And I have you."
"This is pure genius."
"Can I borrow your car?"
"I hear him coming."
"And there we go."
"Maybe it's time."
"Thank you for waiting for me."
"You are really very beautiful."
"This is just the beginning."
"Thank you for following us."
"Did you just find out?"
"Who's the boss here?"
"Are you from the police?"
"How did you find out about this?"
"He has special powers."
"The chance of a lifetime."
"Oh, that's so cute."
"When did you see her?"
"Sorry to call so late."
"It is a peaceful demonstration."
"It was just a joke."
"Do you want to listen to the radio?"
"I was hoping for double that."
"How could I know?"
"Where is the old man?"
"They took the little ones."
"It's sunny."
"Two sugars, right?"
"What do you call it?"
"Is it good or not?"
"That's it, very good."
"I want to be your friend."
"She runs the Avatar program."
"I'm going to do some shopping."
"Just the way I like it."
"There is a place."
"She was my best friend."
"You should call the police."
"You should call the police."
"I repeat, do you hear me?"
"Watch your head."
"I've been waiting for this moment."
"And they will trust me."
"Yes, you have one."
"No, he just left."
"No one tells me anything."
"It's on your desk."
"You have until midnight."
"Am I free to go?"
"I always tell the truth."
"Did you hear anything?"
"Welcome to the White House."
"Do you want some popcorn?"
"Have you had your fill?"
"I can't think."
"I must be getting old."
"But you will recover."
"They are all the same."
"Why do you want to go there?"
"It's very well done."
"I'm sure of that."
"I let her do it."
"What did you do next?"
"Don't start without me."
"It was for your own good."
"See you on the track."
"It must be me."
"You look different."
"I have to find something."
"I'm going for a walk."
"I saw a picture."
"Yes, that's the word."
"It's just a job."
"We'll meet there."
"Whose is it?"
"I have a better plan."
"Do you have a boyfriend?"
"And you, where were you?"
"I beg you, Tony."
"Find out who did this."
"That's the dream."
"I followed your advice."
"As best I can."
"How many were there?"
"Tell them they're coming."
"I have other clients."
"I'll take care of the luggage."
"You are beautiful and intelligent."
"Do you remember the Shire?"
"What is this box?"
"So don't tell him anything."
"Put it on my account."
"He has class."
"Ah, you don't know."
"It's true, you know."
"Are you guys hungry?"
"Let's say you're right."
"I'm on time."
"I'm on time."
"Would you please concentrate?"
"It's going pretty well."
"I waited for hours."
"Have you seen the newspaper?"
"Okay, I have an idea."
"I've already done it."
"A decision had to be made."
"You were in my dream."
"Shall I draw you a picture?"
"How did you find me?"
"I like your style."
"How was your weekend?"
"I work with my father."
"It went well."
"She never listens to me."
"Thank you, that means a lot to me."
"What kind of car is it?"
"We've seen enough."
"You were never born."
"Can I see the room?"
"How did you find us?"
"You've come to the right place."
"We'll talk about it tonight."
"It's a friendly visit."
"You're going home."
"It took you a while."
"What's on it?"
"Do you have another one?"
"I blamed myself."
"It makes your eyes pop."
"The Ring is yours."
"Everyone except you."
"What are we supposed to do?"
"Do you need anything else?"
"Same as here."
"You must go."
"She didn't know anything about it."
"Your place is with Victor."
"Oh, how sweet."
"This is serious business."
"Let's talk about the black bird."
"I know and I appreciate it."
"Hello, nice to meet you."
"How long have you been here?"
"As you will see."
"You'll be fine."
"Do you want to take a bath?"
"Your secret is well kept."
"Did you see him leave?"
"I'm going to take a shower."
"It's between the two of you."
"They are after us."
"You should take care of it."
"I'm not leaving without him."
"Let's go take a look."
"I know, that's a lot."
"This is a good catch."
"What do you mean by that?"
"It was in an airport."
"Because, that's all."
"But what are you thinking?"
"And you, what would you do?"
"He's a nice guy."
"Fine, I'll take care of it."
"I've been waiting for an hour."
"Do you think he knows?"
"I saw the Earth."
"I would do it myself."
"I want you to go out."
"You have beautiful hair."
"Do you want it or not?"
"I grew up in Texas."
"I need guarantees."
"Have you seen her recently?"
"No, they're coming to get me."
"I was just passing by."
"Yes, it can be done."
"I have another theory."
"I thought I had seen it all."
"You won't tell me anything?"
"I have to go, sorry."
"Do you want me to come down?"
"Does that suit you?"
"You have a short memory."
"You have an idea."
"Have you ever been married?"
"We are far from everything."
"I risked my life."
"My car is over there."
"Do you want to have dinner with me?"
"Do you want to hear the monkey?"
"Do you want to see a movie?"
"Do you want to see a movie?"
"I got used to it."
"Not a breath of wind."
"Go take care of that."
"I'm not a kid anymore."
"You're in a good mood."
"No secrets between us."
"I heard that too."
"I'm not a victim."
"I have to prepare dinner."
"What do you think, darling?"
"I'm a nice guy."
"I'm a good guy."
"I came to talk business."
"I'm leaving in a week."
"It's been a year already."
"Norm changed his attitude."
"Something to tell me?"
"Does the police know?"
"I don't know, Master."
"When did it start?"
"It's in his file."
"Can you come for a minute?"
"Have you been working here for a long time?"
"How did you come here?"
"Do you want to do this now?"
"I need a reason."
"Yes, I have one."
"Shall we have a game?"
"I haven't planned anything."
"Okay, you got me."
"Where did you hear that?"
"Can I see his room?"
"I am not Japanese."
"You better make sure."
"What did you do to yourself?"
"Thanks for bringing it."
"I'm just going to talk to him."
"It has sentimental value."
"To teach him a lesson."
"He helped me a lot."
"I'll find something."
"Get to work, everyone."
"So I'll go."
"I want to go to bed."
"As if it was going to happen."
"You are safe and sound."
"How can you talk like that?"
"He wants to see you now."
"I have hope."
"Let me open the door."
"Why did you take it?"
"Who could you be?"
"I knew this would happen."
"It's on time."
"We are family."
"Tell them to hurry up."
"Did I win something?"
"She will never love you."
"She was my little girl."
"Rider of the Last Shadow."
"But now it's over."
"He is in the hall."
"We were supposed to go together."
"What's the topic?"
"When can I see her?"
"I just left him."
"I didn't get it."
"I like that about you."
"I just added it."
"Well, he's right."
"And we found each other."
"Could I have your attention?"
"He had it with him."
"Tell me who it is."
"Actually, it's perfect."
"Captain's log."
"Tap water."
"I'll open the door for you."
"Do you like making love?"
"You look great."
"This man is an imposter."
"I needed to know."
"What is this one?"
"I'm almost out of it."
"It's his birthday tomorrow."
"Look through my eyes."
"I'm going to bed now."
"Do you want to go to the bathroom?"
"I should get back to work."
"This is our last hope."
"I will be on the bridge."
"We are the same age."
"How long have you known him?"
"Can we have some coffee?"
"I had to tell him."
"I think he's coming."
"I will need you."
"Go ahead on my behalf."
"You should have called me."
"As far as I know, yes."
"I left my wife."
"This is very, very important."
"Do you have a better one?"
"Yes, you are probably right."
"These are organic crops."
"Who is the commanding officer?"
"I'll take care of it tomorrow."
"Can I see your card?"
"No one else but me."
"I would do anything for her."
"People are like that."
"I don't trust anymore."
"What should I have said?"
"I'll explain to you one day."
"I spoke to the doctor."
"You have to go get him."
"She was my whole life."
"So many things can happen."
"No, I bought it."
"Wait, I'll show you."
"Did you take your painkiller?"
"Of course, if you want."
"And that I love you."
"If you allow me."
"You wanted to see me, boss?"
"You're going to wake the children up."
"Have you ever been in love?"
"Who is the strongest?"
"What's going on there?"
"I took advantage of you."
"But I know the truth."
"I'll put you through to the president."
"But I'm telling you."
"I was in a daze."
"It is important to me."
"Come let me introduce you."
"I take the first plane."
"Make me a copy."
"You are my last hope."
"There it is."
"He works all the time."
"What are you guys doing?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Take care of the girl."
"I need it now."
"I am a just man."
"There is an address."
"Yes, but it's different."
"Just go ahead."
"Where did you meet her?"
"I come for the monkeys."
"It's a natural reaction."
"Hi, Mom, it's me."
"Did you hear the news?"
"You live in the past."
"How long have you known each other?"
"Can I borrow your phone?"
"She doesn't talk to anyone."
"The car is over there."
"Not much to see."
"Where did you meet him?"
"I want you with me."
"It's my hobby."
"Before everything happened."
"I think you know."
"I'll give you my card."
"You are a good commander."
"But yes, I love you."
"That's a good point."
"You think you're at home."
"You didn't dare."
"They are here for you."
"What is this?"
"We have to take care of it."
"My life is at stake."
"They are no longer there."
"The address is within reach."
"It's almost your birthday."
"And she chose you."
"You asked me, Colonel?"
"Because I want to know."
"You will be safe."
"No, he isn't."
"I had an abortion."
"Can't you pay attention?"
"Your word against mine."
"I have an important question."
"Where are we taking him?"
"Honey, please."
"It can be useful to us."
"Can I borrow your cell phone?"
"You'll pay me later."
"I'm going to tell the truth."
"You must not wait."
"This is my little secret."
"Go ahead, call the police."
"Are you still looking for stories?"
"But that will never happen."
"Put it on my tab."
"Put it on my tab."
"What's changing?"
"I heard an explosion."
"No, everything is fine."
"Is that your secret?"
"Do you have any change?"
"Are you in the area?"
"He's a good agent."
"Were you going to say something?"
"Are you sure?"
"The Lord is this mountain."
"He's a good horse."
"There are complications."
"I wrote a book."
"You never talked about it."
"What if I said no?"
"Everything is fine, it's fine."
"Aren't you changing?"
"Do you see how it works?"
"But he's my friend."
"I'll give you the money."
"I read an article."
"I don't know, boss."
"At my place or yours?"
"You're not finished?"
"Nice to meet you."
"They did their reconstruction."
"We are in the street."
"This applies to everyone."
"I got a tip."
"It won't."
"All of us."
"I just wanted to say it."
"Everything else depends on it."
"Where do we start?"
"I chose to stay."
"I want to tell the truth."
"I'll take both."
"Do you do gymnastics?"
"Sorry I'm late."
"I promise you one thing."
"This is no longer true."
"She's a little shaken."
"Things and others."
"Do you think I'm bluffing?"
"Do you want to dance with me?"
"Even if it's true."
"Where did you find this?"
"Where did you find this?"
"This is the main focus."
"Are you giving me orders?"
"You better succeed."
"Who raised the alarm?"
"Light, please."
"Everything will be fine."
"Yes, in a way."
"What are these stories?"
"Do you want to get caught?"
"It's a coded message."
"Nobody wants to believe me."
"I followed my instinct."
"The captain wants to see you."
"You go first."
"You must go home."
"He thought of everything."
"What is it, anyway?"
"Do you know where they are going?"
"I thought it would work."
"Everyone was happy."
"You have a lot of nerve."
"This one is for you."
"I will pass the message on."
"I have hundreds of them."
"I want to start from scratch."
"She will be back soon."
"It's a real fortress."
"I thought you were asleep."
"Do you want to get rid of it?"
"Thank him for me."
"It's a little gift."
"Glad you're home."
"What do you know about him?"
"How did you find it?"
"What is left for us?"
"What's your name, son?"
"She didn't come out."
"You have to do this right."
"I need a pick-me-up."
"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys."
"She left her phone."
"What are you going to do there?"
"You should see your face."
"I have one left."
"The color of his eyes?"
"Come see me tonight."
"There were many of them."
"You will hear from us."
"I could do without it."
"You need a mandate."
"What are you doing with him?"
"You cut your hair."
"We must tell the truth."
"You pay."
"And he was on sedatives?"
"It seemed so."
"I know where to find you."
"He is in a good mood."
"We were shot at."
"On the top shelf."
"Have you seen James Cole?"
"They hide them up there."
"Do you want to see this one?"
"But not as much as you."
"Haven't you had enough?"
"This is another reason."
"And the pay is good."
"Time stood still."
"And what do you think about it?"
"And what do you think about it?"
"He got you good."
"Did he give it to you?"
"Please wait."
"Got you, huh?"
"My father did it."
"I'm doing very well, thank you."
"I forgot my gloves."
"When will you introduce her to me?"
"Are you in or not?"
"I cooked dinner."
"Others will come from Heaven."
"Do you have anything to write down?"
"It's not sexy."
"I will rise to the occasion."
"You don't take any?"
"Tell him to hurry."
"It's up to you to cross it."
"This is our home."
"Have you never done it?"
"I bought a house."
"Are you taking care of yourself?"
"No, it's just me."
"He is with a patient."
"I heard some stuff."
"It's just a cut."
"I will find money."
"You're going to take that plane."
"Do you want honesty?"
"Do you know who's in charge here?"
"Are you coming from the city?"
"Smile, please."
"No, you don't know anything."
"Have you seen this sign?"
"There is a baby."
"The woman of your life?"
"What are you talking about?"
"I made love."
"How can this be possible?"
"You should have told him."
"That's good for that."
"I have to get back to work."
"I will do it as soon as possible."
"I almost got it."
"I made a deal."
"You didn't leave?"
"Tell me more about Jeffrey."
"I'm here if needed."
"I am a security guard."
"You are a wise man."
"He has resources."
"What do we know about him?"
"I'll buy you a drink."
"Did he ask you?"
"I'm doing this for you."
"What did you give me?"
"It's a video game."
"Do you have any on you?"
"If you want."
"If you don't mind."
"I'll make you an offer."
"There is a price."
"They threatened my family."
"It's a beautiful day."
"I heard the call."
"Do you have it with you?"
"Yes, it is a possibility."
"Everything seems to be in order."
"They are at school."
"I'm going to turn around."
"We must keep the faith."
"How are you holding up?"
"I didn't know him."
"Your father is waiting for you there."
"And for how long?"
"Tell me about your husband."
"The law of the jungle."
"I should go see him."
"Does this mean anything to you?"
"Nothing but water."
"I want half of it."
"No, I can't take it anymore."
"I thought I knew you."
"No one should see it."
"Can we talk for a minute?"
"Identification, please."
"Give mom a kiss."
"She was full of life."
"No, he's my brother."
"Please leave."
"I will do anything for you."
"It's hot in there."
"You know that, right?"
"I just want to thank you."
"I'm with the FBI."
"He is as he is."
"It never happened."
"You are a nice girl."
"You are a good girl."
"Dad, what is this?"
"What are you here for?"
"Do you want to get some fresh air?"
"You must understand one thing."
"She is retired."
"You never talk about it."
"She is in the house."
"I'm going to load the car."
"She just left."
"It has always belonged to you."
"What was it like there?"
"This is his modus operandi."
"Day and night."
"What was it this time?"
"You were very clear."
"Was the hunt good?"
"It was all cooked."
"Are you in love with him?"
"I don't touch you."
"Maybe it was him."
"He's a good teacher."
"No one says otherwise."
"This is a talking movie."
"I'll buy you a beer."
"No, he won't come."
"Well, that's a start."
"He is on the beach."
"I hope you understand."
"You're doing whatever you want."
"You're putting on a show."
"I'll make you a list."
"Maybe it will work."
"I'm going to speak to you frankly."
"It's full of vitamins."
"Do you know how we do it?"
"Are you listening?"
"You are a good soldier."
"Let's follow these traces of paint."
"Do you know how much it's worth?"
"And I took it."
"This is your avatar now."
"Your father would have been proud."
"It's beautiful, isn't it?"
"You have always been strong."
"It wasn't mean."
"No, I'll be fine, thanks."
"He knows where you are."
"You must know that well."
"I had to act."
"I like to see the sun."
"I won the bet."
"I didn't ask him anything."
"How long have you been here?"
"How can you believe it?"
"We'll be back in a moment."
"Go get some water."
"He always gets away with it."
"Since when have they been doing this?"
"I brought mine."
"I'll give it back to you tomorrow."
"He has a long arm."
"You are a good police officer."
"Get her out of here."
"You don't need to."
"I came back for this."
"I thank God for that."
"We do our best."
"And what do I tell them?"
"I played the game."
"How long has he been here?"
"No, I'll stay here."
"Were you in love with her?"
"I would like to have your opinion."
"I came back for you."
"Guess what I have."
"He is a powerful foreigner."
"Everyone said it."
"Glad you called."
"The boss wants to talk to you."
"Are we going to the bedroom?"
"I like doing that."
"That's cool for you."
"I want to find my son."
"I have to tell you about it."
"They are from the police."
"I think of my mother."
"He is involved in politics."
"Let's do it your way."
"We are in the right place."
"Yes, everything is in order."
"She has to go."
"They got your message."
"What are you playing at?"
"Have fun, kids."
"I almost fainted."
"It's a good product."
"Let me prove it to you."
"Can you tell me why?"
"Did you party?"
"She might have gone out."
"He is the most qualified."
"Everyone takes it."
"Will it take much longer?"
"How long will it take?"
"She won't do that."
"As he said."
"I brought her to you."
"Your place is with us."
"Why are you so interested in this?"
"What do you have for me?"
"I already know the answer."
"I volunteered."
"But where do you come from?"
"Can you be more specific?"
"What I always do."
"He may be telling the truth."
"You are his spitting image."
"Go get another one."
"This is a good lead."
"Now's his chance."
"No one is stopping you."
"And there, what do you see?"
"People like me."
"I want this to end."
"Any news about my daughter?"
"This is my new friend."
"He is a good lawyer."
"How are you sure?"
"Do you trust me?"
"Think carefully before you answer."
"What was your head at?"
"What should I tell him?"
"He was born like that."
"Did you hear that, guys?"
"Analysis is in progress."
"Are you in the cinema?"
"I think she's asleep."
"Where do you know him from?"
"We've all seen it."
"We've all seen it."
"You are my big brother."
"I will bring you something to eat."
"What was I supposed to do?"
"This is for your mother."
"You tell me something."
"That's the reality."
"Do you want to see his picture?"
"Can you promise me?"
"Here is my business card."
"I got the job."
"This is the last step."
"Look, I'll show you."
"I want the same thing."
"She's his girlfriend."
"I can tell you everything."
"Let's see how it goes."
"He comes every day."
"It always starts like this."
"It's just a costume."
"How would I have known?"
"He asked for a lawyer."
"Who are the other candidates?"
"She doesn't know."
"You already know the answer."
"You should have seen me."
"Have you seen my husband?"
"How did it feel?"
"Do you want to tell me about it?"
"I'll try the number."
"I'm getting married soon."
"I'll take the first quarter."
"In a retirement home."
"That's good news."
"I like you too."
"Why are you making a face?"
"We're going home."
"It's your turn now."
"Let me introduce you to my mother."
"No, I don't hear anything."
"Ahead of his time."
"She told us."
"I know him a little."
"He's that big."
"This is an important topic."
"You are here with me."
"Don't sleep with him."
"Can you tell me about it?"
"It took years."
"I'll meet you there."
"I need to speak to the commander."
"I didn't take any."
"I'll show you."
"It's in a month."
"Do you want to go out with her?"
"Where did you get it?"
"Yes, I believe in God."
"I'm going to look for him."
"What will they say about him?"
"I love you, my angel."
"Not so small."
"Where did you hide it?"
"They are attracted to him."
"What matters?"
"I have to tell him."
"I called your office."
"Was he your boyfriend?"
"I taught myself."
"And what is the answer?"
"But we can talk, right?"
"She is part of me."
"We have a good team."
"Now I have to go."
"I should never have."
"It was a great match."
"You're talking about a brother."
"What was her name again?"
"I'm not a kid."
"But I want to do it."
"I must say goodbye now."
"It's a new life."
"You hadn't noticed?"
"What did you want to show me?"
"Nobody knows who you are."
"She can't do anything."
"Is everyone served?"
"You have to go that way."
"Have you seen this guy?"
"We have to go to Florida."
"No, you did the right thing."
"There is glass."
"I wanted to say goodbye to you."
"It's a big family."
"It could take years."
"It changes all the time."
"We received orders."
"I am an honest man."
"I apologize for that."
"We just received it."
"I expect anything."
"How do you want to play it?"
"I'll get it for you."
"Otherwise, it will be the stick."
"Do you have family?"
"There is a queue."
"She needs water."
"That was my first impression."
"Can you give it back to them?"
"I want to have children."
"Who did all this?"
"No one will know the difference."
"I really saw it."
"Is this your last word?"
"Is this from?"
"But it's my life."
"Did he let you go?"
"They are not ordinary."
"How many languages do you speak?"
"How much will it cost us?"
"But what happened?"
"Have you seen this dog?"
"That's good, my dear."
"Please do."
"What is it, Captain?"
"Yes, I called him."
"You're one of us."
"I'll take you with me."
"I will wait with you."
"I read your article."
"Have you seen the news?"
"Have we seen each other before?"
"Do you have any other ideas?"
"This is the next step."
"They are heading towards us."
"Are you ready for this?"
"There are six of them."
"You did your job."
"You owe me a favor."
"I'll show you something."
"And for good reason."
"I hope it works."
"I will trust you."
"I'm leaving soon."
"Don't come any closer."
"I mean, look at you."
"And you, what do you think?"
"What are you going to tell them?"
"What I have to do."
"They know we're coming."
"Yes, I read them."
"Yes, I saw you."
"I can't stop anything."
"Maybe I should try."
"Because you are good."
"Have you found the commander?"
"The car is downstairs."
"Do you remember Ross?"
"I have to go talk to him."
"It's a nice hotel."
"Fourteen years ago."
"Glad you're feeling better."
"Thank God you were there."
"I have a feeling about it."
"You need a wife."
"Would you mind leaving us?"
"I have the right, right?"
"It's not there."
"Thank you for bringing me."
"Everyone must participate."
"I asked myself that."
"You need us."
"Who wants to eat cereal?"
"Isn't he perfect?"
"Not at the moment, no."
"I should come with you."
"Is this yours?"
"He was a good kid."
"How long have you been working here?"
"It's a family business."
"Communication with the outside world?"
"I have two left."
"I have to go, okay?"
"It's for show."
"I'm used to it."
"Take back what belongs to us."
"There was a child."
"When are you going to tell him?"
"Did I say it right?"
"You just arrived."
"Did you bring her here?"
"I had already seen it."
"This is your new partner."
"It's just a guess."
"I'll ask him."
"I'm going to take the train."
"You have beautiful eyes."
"Where should I send it?"
"We have common interests."
"And many other things."
"How do you know his name?"
"She's waiting in the car."
"Why did you do that?"
"Baltimore County Hospital."
"Are you closing the door?"
"What does it consist of?"
"I'm in the place."
"Oh, I'll take care of it."
"Do you want to go to bed?"
"And what are you?"
"I'm here to pick up some things."
"Afterwards, we'll leave."
"This is just an example."
"What are you doing down there?"
"My sister liked it."
"Do you want to know the truth?"
"Two bullets in the chest."
"How did he know?"
"Is it to your liking?"
"Are you here on business?"
"How did they do that?"
"I sold the house."
"Did you call home?"
"I'm doing well and you?"
"His words, not mine."
"Tell me just one thing."
"Wait for me in my office."
"You're not the boss."
"Do you want some ice cream?"
"What else can I tell you?"
"Have you tried his cell phone?"
"I'm a good shot."
"As you said."
"All to battle stations."
"How much do you need?"
"Who is this girl?"
"Things are different here."
"Nice to have met you."
"You have a good memory."
"You should go now."
"How dare you challenge me?"
"What do I do in the meantime?"
"You dare do this to me?"
"It's on the map."
"But I have to go back."
"What are you going to do with it?"
"Which side are you on?"
"I have to find my family."
"It's in my car."
"He told me."
"I went to bed early."
"But I still love him."
"I was on the verge."
"You have to get used to it."
"How about we have a drink?"
"She can't hear me."
"You came back for me."
"I'm on my own."
"I thought you understood."
"There is a bucket."
"You are an excellent observer."
"I can't say."
"Oh, yes, that's it."
"What are you apologizing for?"
"Right in the face."
"How would you have known?"
"I'll get a drink."
"We have proof."
"It comes from outside."
"Say something nice."
"Come on, we can do it."
"Do you know where I was?"
"He is a young man."
"She didn't love me."
"And what do I have?"
"Are you going to a funeral?"
"Sounds fascinating."
"You passed the test."
"Don't you recognize me?"
"I was expecting you earlier."
"Did you receive my gift?"
"There is a surprise."
"I need it too."
"No need to scream."
"This is the White House."
"I brought flowers."
"What is the correct answer?"
"You'll tell me later."
"It's perfect for us."
"What was that story?"
"I should be with them."
"We have to make a decision."
"Who's in on it?"
"Do you know how much it costs?"
"You are a remarkable woman."
"You wanted to see me, Commander?"
"It's for our own good."
"Have you seen the news?"
"It was a good start."
"You knew I would come."
"I would have done the same."
"I think of you often."
"Someone is taking care of it."
"Put it back in its place."
"Can we watch TV?"
"He needs to talk."
"It's exactly the same."
"Nick, please."
"No, stay where you are."
"I already have a father."
"I was born there."
"I'll talk to you later."
"I have to take a picture."
"I did the cleaning."
"There is something."
"We will do as you wish."
"You and who else?"
"That's a bit tight."
"Anyone home?"
"Can I have a coffee?"
"This might be interesting."
"Our paths separate here."
"Why don't you come to my house?"
"I was just waiting for that."
"Are you going to just stand there?"
"Don't slam the door."
"I'm going to leave here."
"So, can I go?"
"Something must be done."
"Look at those two."
"Of course it works."
"He's a good actor."
"No, I'm not giving up."
"Are you following me or what?"
"I need to call someone."
"We do a lot of surfing."
"I'll keep up to date."
"I don't think like that."
"Where did you see it?"
"My office is over there."
"I came for you."
"But who are these people?"
"It's mud."
"You're going to get caught."
"I try to stay calm."
"Everyone is here."
"It's great art."
"What are we supposed to do?"
"Would you like to walk without shoes?"
"Where are you meeting?"
"I hope you do too."
"Yes, whatever you want."
"Yes, I learned that."
"Have you read them all?"
"I should have called you."
"And I'm happy about it."
"I'll see you tomorrow."
"Thank you for coming, doctor."
"I didn't want to."
"I'll let you settle in."
"Don, can I talk to you?"
"Everything is fine, my love."
"You didn't know anything about it?"
"Yes, if you say so."
"You have to understand something."
"How long have you known her?"
"What was that thing?"
"What did you answer him?"
"Who am I to you?"
"She's in the pound."
"What do you think about it?"
"She's the one in charge."
"Are you going to the party?"
"What do you plan to do now?"
"Who are you exactly?"
"May I know your name?"
"You should try it sometime."
"What is the police doing here?"
"We see other things."
"Do you know where they are?"
"What do I need?"
"I have a long arm."
"Please, baby."
"Please come in."
"It could take forever."
"Where did you send it?"
"She's just a child."
"I haven't seen them."
"Actually, it was me."
"No, I don't mind."
"I'm not there yet."
"I need to know something."
"What did you want to talk about?"
"I'm taking this case off your hands."
"Yes, she is my wife."
"I read your novel."
"How could it be?"
"He is with a girl."
"We trust you."
"Enough for a new head?"
"I will love you forever."
"She had a boyfriend."
"He deserves better than this."
"You don't have a car?"
"Just a little bit more."
"You weren't expecting me?"
"You were a great friend."
"The journey is going to be long."
"He was a good guy."
"He is my right arm."
"I'll make things right."
"Please accept."
"You are living in a dream."
"One minute, please."
"I love being with you."
"We need to move faster."
"I need them tomorrow."
"What do you do for a living?"
"There are advantages."
"I'll get some plates."
"He's the one calling."
"He looks awesome."
"I told you."
"I told you so."
"I went to her house."
"At least for me."
"I'm going to close the window."
"What did she expect?"
"I didn't drink anything."
"What do you think about that?"
"Shall I bring you something?"
"How about we go to my place?"
"No, he's my husband."
"Are you a sissy?"
"I was having a little fun."
"I'm here for the announcement."
"They won this round."
"My name is Allison Dubois."
"And she said yes."
"Do you know where I live?"
"Would you like to open the door?"
"I'll tell you about it."
"I'm going to get the police."
"Can we call someone?"
"And it still is."
"From time to time, yes."
"I had it removed."
"I will take care of you."
"This is the best, right?"
"As she said."
"Welcome to the real world."
"But it's better now."
"Everything has turned around now."
"Do you have enough space?"
"You're late, man."
"What did she tell you?"
"Come on, please."
"So, what do we do now?"
"That's it, my dear."
"We are on your side."
"I ask you to leave."
"Yes, in a way."
"When did he disappear?"
"Eagle One, this is Star One."
"I have to protect my son."
"Believe me, it's true."
"Because of my wife."
"Did you see him do it?"
"I'm in the hallway."
"But he's my son."
"What's wrong with your arm?"
"And what does that do to you?"
"We'll be there in a minute."
"You would need antibiotics."
"Did you expect that?"
"What if I can't?"
"That's it, go ahead."
"Let's try something new."
"It's all in the details."
"Are you from the area?"
"We're all there."
"Stay exactly where you are."
"Don't you know?"
"They are all yours."
"Can I have the keys?"
"Have you seen any of them?"
"Have you seen your face?"
"Do you want to take care of it?"
"Tell him to let go of me."
"She's not a girl."
"Can I have a kiss?"
"Can I have a kiss?"
"How did you meet her?"
"What is this badge?"
"It's first class."
"He must have had a reason."
"You're like everyone else."
"I wanted to."
"Who do you think we are?"
"Put it inside."
"What if this is it?"
"Do you want me to repeat?"
"Is that your theory?"
"How much is it for?"
"It feels so good."
"Have you had any news?"
"I have to do some tests."
"He must know something."
"You investigated me."
"What are you going to call him?"
"I'm just going to the bathroom."
"There is a 'but'."
"Do I look different?"
"She looks great."
"Oh, that's so sweet."
"You are an intelligent woman."
"Dad, don't say that."
"Let's put on some music."
"Is this the right number?"
"Do you think you can do it?"
"I declare the meeting open."
"Are you asking yourself the question?"
"I was the one driving."
"Do you do gymnastics?"
"I met a guy."
"You come whenever you want."
"I saw them do it."
"He belongs to my father."
"I am proud of myself."
"It won't happen again, I promise."
"I got you again."
"I'm going to the bank."
"Can I make a comment?"
"It can last for hours."
"I feel all different."
"Let's stick to the facts."
"You are all against me."
"You've gained weight."
"She takes care of me."
"I came home early."
"No, I don't feel anything."
"Go ahead, have fun."
"I wanted to see your reaction."
"He came to get her."
"I have work to do."
"I have ballistic expertise."
"It's a big night."
"That's a bit much."
"How many are there?"
"Because you are different."
"Is that right, Captain?"
"He is a brilliant man."
"No, he's my friend."
"I have eye contact."
"I'll take care of it tomorrow."
"Who did you talk to?"
"She needs money."
"That he had plans?"
"She doesn't want to talk."
"I saw his file."
"I will never forgive you."
"How did you come here?"
"It was a good speech."
"I thought you were working."
"Where did you get that from?"
"I'll get a bandage."
"Shall we get to work?"
"You are a rational being."
"Not for money."
"A little more over there."
"He took it from me."
"They're all gone, right?"
"I read his book."
"It makes you feel good."
"How was it last night?"
"Not just about animals."
"Please come out."
"Because he's black?"
"Everyone was."
"But what are you doing here?"
"He betrayed us all."
"What is your wife's name?"
"Sorry to have woken you up."
"When did you meet him?"
"It will take time."
"It was for his own good."
"Do you like another one?"
"I'm going to tidy up a bit."
"No, I don't like it."
"If you have one."
"Are you sure you're okay?"
"Has this ever happened to him?"
"Yes, he is very handsome."
"When can I see you again?"
"They know where she is."
"What's your game?"
"They thought of everything."
"I understand you, you know."
"You have a strong heart."
"Wouldn't that be wonderful?"
"A little common sense."
"I love you guys."
"Thank you for taking my call."
"Give this to your mother."
"I'm not ready yet."
"I will make myself very small."
"I saw the future."
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
"Have you seen my daughter?"
"And how do you plan to do it?"
"Attention to all units."
"I know, it's true."
"What you said."
"We make a great team."
"Did you see your attacker?"
"We will be together forever."
"I almost had it."
"This is my best offer."
"I'm here to win."
"You have a big mouth."
"No, I'm a friend."
"It can't be him."
"Thank you again for coming."
"I could take care of that."
"Do you live near here?"
"Did you get caught?"
"His body was found."
"Can you come back later?"
"Go as far as you can."
"You helped me a lot."
"Do you see it like that?"
"As if I knew."
"What do you want, exactly?"
"She's a wimp."
"You have to swallow something."
"I called your mother."
"That's what they say."
"What do you take me for?"
"How is my big boy doing?"
"I sent flowers."
"He's right behind you."
"You don't work here."
"I know, I get it."
"I think you should."
"Can't you talk?"
"I like your costume."
"You are my only friend."
"I need someone."
"You're not going to say anything?"
"But I can do it."
"What can happen to us?"
"At the top of the stairs."
"I'm no better."
"I recognize her well there."
"We are in the United States."
"I have a lot of experience."
"You should take a shower."
"But I'll get there."
"Do you remember the name?"
"It belonged to my father."
"Were you in love with him?"
"I'll take this one."
"Did you get an offer?"
"What I can do."
"It's over for us."
"Boarding pass and passport."
"Thank you, I feel better."
"Have you been here long?"
"I'm not sulking."
"We have different styles."
"She is with me now."
"He is mentally ill."
"I have to do my job."
"I ate with them."
"They didn't understand."
"You are more than welcome."
"Yes, I'm sure."
"You have things in common."
"What we did."
"But you must know this."
"Do you have another card?"
"Yes, we can do that."
"This can't go on."
"I see it like that."
"There is an inscription."
"You have to tell us."
"Do you know where she lives?"
"Not all at once."
"Who are you hiding from?"
"She already has one."
"Yeah, he's right there."
"Not one more day."
"You need to eat."
"A sleight of hand."
"Please don't do this."
"I don't protect him."
"You just have to find it."
"Yeah, I'll do that."
"He's a straight guy."
"And who said that?"
"There is a protocol."
"It's a pleasant surprise."
"Call me if you need anything."
"Do you remember them?"
"This is the first step."
"What's the deal?"
"I might get a taste for it."
"Where are you going?"
"I want to see the person in charge."
"No, I'm telling the truth."
"You have to keep your strength up."
"But I have one condition."
"Let's go see inside."
"We got your message."
"He thinks he comes from the future."
"That's my name."
"Uh, I have to go."
"That's him, right there."
"It was a lovely evening."
"This is our man."
"Say you love me."
"This is a restricted area."
"It will only take a second."
"We found someone."
"I was talking nonsense."
"This one says he knows you."
"You're going to make me throw up."
"You have to leave town."
"I need a map."
"Do you have a good lawyer?"
"Is he here or not?"
"The man for the job."
"She doesn't."
"It's a beautiful morning."
"Yes, they did."
"But, are you up for it?"
"Dad didn't come?"
"He ran away."
"How many months has it been?"
"The master or the apprentice?"
"Will you open the door for me?"
"Let's go, everyone."
"The King's Dwarf Uncle."
"We'll see when the time comes."
"You have to be very careful."
"I can promise you that."
"You were right about everything."
"Two minutes ago."
"Should I call security?"
"This is a good element."
"How long have you been doing this?"
"Do you like to party?"
"Everything will be fine for you."
"What time is it?"
"He was a good dog."
"I'm in the living room."
"We are your humble servants."
"You don't take any?"
"This book is mine."
"I find you very beautiful."
"I ask you one thing."
"Do you have a better explanation?"
"I want to hear his voice."
"You are different from others."
"How does this thing work?"
"I can go get it."
"There is a dam."
"The world ends like this."
"Are you in love with her?"
"So she played along."
"Yes, I have one."
"You dropped that."
"Nobody talked about it."
"I had a child."
"Are you comfortable?"
"I have to see my wife."
"I know where you are."
"I'll find out soon."
"Can you speak less loudly?"
"He is an extraordinary man."
"I'm in the kitchen."
"I'll see her later."
"Please continue."
"Everyone will be fine."
"It's for all of us."
"You look cool."
"I was expecting you earlier."
"I'll wait for you up there."
"You see, whenever you want."
"Just saying."
"Are we expected this time?"
"Don't you want to try?"
"This is what I was looking for."
"I was nearby."
"It's just a dance."
"He is beside himself."
"One foot after the other."
"No, it's my mother."
"She knows who I am."
"I don't have to."
"If that is your wish."
"You're a smart guy."
"But I am a man."
"The bridge is yours."
"If you were mine."
"I felt the same way."
"Something or someone?"
"Does this remind you of anything?"
"Yes, it's much better."
"He has the means."
"I'll give you two."
"I'll bring you a coffee."
"He will take care of everything."
"Let us take care of it."
"Are we going to the hotel?"
"You should go out more often."
"You have a lot to do."
"I have to go back to the store."
"You remember that, right?"
"Now I remember."
"This is a good photo."
"If all goes well."
"Half is mine."
"So what did he say?"
"I'm looking forward to it."
"We all have secrets."
"I do this for myself."
"Again and again and again."
"Do you want me to dance?"
"You didn't know that?"
"I'll try to talk to him."
"Can you believe it?"
"I would have told you."
"What should I think about it?"
"We have to do it together."
"Do you want more coffee?"
"There is a colony."
"How do I get home?"
"Where did you see that?"
"I want you to go out."
"Can we go back?"
"Do you want to come to my place?"
"They know who feeds them."
"It was the only time."
"How can you tell?"
"It's a perfect plan."
"I can get used to it."
"Tell me where we're going."
"He got had."
"I want to see the movie."
"Have you read the book?"
"How did you do that?"
"Let me do my job."
"I drank two glasses."
"She has green eyes."
"No, you can go."
"Who could it be?"
"I'll see you tomorrow morning."
"She looks smart."
"I'll look into that later."
"But he wasn't there."
"This is reality."
"And the year before?"
"Look the other way."
"She doesn't talk much."
"It's business as usual."
"Did you see his look?"
"I am a respectable man."
"I would like to say a few words."
"Are you ready to go?"
"Look how handsome he is."
"When did you write this?"
"Are you doing this for me?"
"Now it's mine."
"I can show it to you."
"Look the other way."
"Of course it matters."
"Can we take a picture?"
"Go play in your room."
"Where did you get that?"
"When did you find out?"
"What are you talking about?"
"You are in love with me."
"Do you want to come in and examine it?"
"Keep them safe."
"I am the law."
"But you thought it."
"I know others."
"No, it's the Flow."
"Did you hear the news?"
"I know the people involved."
"At least it's clear."
"I should have come earlier."
"I'm getting out of a relationship."
"Let's get one thing straight."
"You're just a wimp."
"How should I take it?"
"I found the body."
"I like how it sounds."
"We're going to draw lots."
"Do you want to go to the bathroom?"
"May His will be done."
"He's making fun of me."
"I need tools."
"Can you do me a favor?"
"Are you listening to me or what?"
"Are you listening to me or what?"
"You will feel better tomorrow."
"It has everything in it."
"Actually, it's true."
"It's in the basement."
"You didn't ask for anything."
"Do you know where he lives?"
"We found a donor."
"How did you get it?"
"How did you get it?"
"Don't move from there."
"I woke up here."
"A pleasure to meet you."
"Are you sure it's him?"
"Gone with the Wind?"
"We are inside."
"It tastes like it."
"You are a busy man."
"He's going to do something."
"Do you know how much it costs?"
"I'm coming to see my brother."
"I took the call."
"It comes down to this."
"I forgot to ask."
"My opinion doesn't count?"
"Are you going to let me go?"
"That's it, guys."
"You are safe."
"I have other ambitions."
"It looks good."
"I'm going to the mall."
"Are you coming to do some shopping?"
"I'm from security."
"He knows where to find me."
"She won't know."
"Will you leave us for a moment?"
"What more could you ask for?"
"Do you know where to find it?"
"How do you feel about me?"
"It's like a miracle."
"The Shadow and the Flame."
"Don't you want to watch?"
"I know how to get there."
"Are you taking this seriously?"
"But we have to go."
"Slowly, please."
"Are you in your room?"
"They are already on their way."
"I think you're in good shape."
"Hallowed be thy name."
"I will make an effort."
"That's pretty good, right?"
"Don't you see them?"
"See you at work."
"I've seen it all."
"Did you find something?"
"That's exactly it."
"What do you mean he's gone?"
"She didn't say that."
"I didn't ask for that."
"Can I take my things?"
"What do you say to this?"
"You should know something."
"It's very quiet here."
"We are on time."
"Sorry for bringing it up."
"He never does that."
"We'll get it later."
"If that's how it is."
"This is also my favorite."
"I had it done."
"I'll take care of it, thank you."
"I live nearby."
"You should get treatment."
"A dinner would be nice."
"Met the general or me?"
"We certainly have been."
"You have to turn around."
"He is heartbroken."
"I was behind the door."
"You freaked us out."
"Where should I stand?"
"No, it doesn't exist."
"Please find safe shelter."
"Are you on my side?"
"What do you know about him?"
"He thinks he's God."
"What do we know about her?"
"All this in one week?"
"Did you take the money?"
"She can't take it anymore."
"They shot at us."
"A big fat hot dog."
"Not really a personal message."
"Where are you from, Willard?"
"I can afford it."
"It must come from here."
"There is a regulation."
"Where are my manners?"
"He is nice to me."
"I get in the car."
"Did you come for that?"
"We'll take care of that."
"Let me introduce you to my mother."
"I can't talk right now."
"This is a first step."
"This is what you are."
"I opened the window."
"Is this love?"
"I'm going to pack my things."
"I'll give you a price."
"Haven't you found anything better?"
"He may have come home."
"But I am his wife."
"He'll be pleased."
"Let's go on another tour."
"It will not be so."
"I'm just telling the truth."
"I will behave myself."
"Where is this guy?"
"That's good, sweetie."
"We'll be back in a moment."
"I assure you it is."
"I like watching TV."
"We will take care of him."
"I'll write you a check."
"What do you want for Christmas?"
"Now I have one."
"Tell whatever you want."
"They are good kids."
"I come from very far away."
"Do you want me to drive?"
"It has to be done right."
"He's just a guy."
"I was paying you a compliment."
"I'll take it with me."
"Put it in the truck."
"I still love you so much."
"I wanted to do you a favor."
"Do you want to go for a walk?"
"I live in the present moment."
"Who was this guy?"
"Ah, I don't know."
"What does the police say?"
"I worked for them."
"I can't have them."
"A gift to celebrate."
"I have to remember that."
"We're going to the police."
"Do you believe in God now?"
"She's in the garage."
"You will find another one."
"You're a nice guy."
"We're on a case."
"I'll give you a minute."
"You had us good."
"He is sure of himself."
"He was another man."
"I needed company."
"It's a big commitment."
"But how do you know?"
"She must not know anything."
"She'll be here in a minute."
"It will take a few minutes."
"What did she do to you?"
"In all fairness."
"It looks lovely."
"What was this guy's name?"
"You'll never find it."
"That's great for you."
"I prefer to stay with you."
"I saw the sign."
"I'm going back to base."
"And you, who are you?"
"I'm in the middle of a divorce."
"That's a good theory."
"No need to wait."
"This is the future."
"It went by so fast."
"Doing what?"
"Who doesn't know him?"
"When are you going to do it?"
"What grade are you in?"
"Can I touch your face?"
"It's better to go there."
"This is my little sister."
"No speeding."
"In the meeting room."
"You were there for me."
"Are you going to university?"
"Can I see your ticket?"
"Who doesn't know that?"
"Do you think you can get away with it?"
"Who is your friend?"
"Tell me another story."
"Are you going to let him do it?"
"I'll tell you what."
"I'll tell you what."
"No, I didn't want to."
"I can show them to you."
"Know that I love you."
"I said goodbye."
"A gift from me."
"Through the front door."
"I had a drink."
"I think it's good."
"Otherwise, I'll call the police."
"Whose is it then?"
"Would you let me teach you?"
"Take this and get out."
"Months ago."
"I obeyed orders."
"Can you read and write?"
"Did we miss something?"
"The press conference begins."
"He left his wife."
"A moment ago."
"It won't happen to you."
"He was my first love."
"I found him outside."
"This is the biggest."
"There are two doors."
"Your brother wants to talk to you."
"That was the easiest."
"This is a classic case."
"I am a rich man."
"I wanted to ask you for forgiveness."
"I just want answers."
"How did you get here?"
"You have a long arm."
"Do you want to see pictures?"
"It's a long road."
"She is a real beauty."
"You don't want to leave?"
"What did you promise him?"
"The judge is God."
"Is she home?"
"No one saw them."
"He was a good father."
"He already has one."
"I saw your look."
"Spider-Man was a hero."
"I want you to win."
"But are you coming with us?"
"How many cameras do you have?"
"I need the money."
"Do you still want to go?"
"Because I don't want to."
"Yes, you're probably right."
"Money buys happiness."
"You don't have any more?"
"She didn't arrive."
"I really like your hair."
"We will take care of you."
"Do you live with your parents?"
"No, I don't know him."
"It was every man for himself."
"We get along very well."
"No, why do you say that?"
"Everything will be fine for him."
"No one ever is."
"Have you known him for a long time?"
"Please wait."
"I'll tell you outside."
"She's a nice girl."
"Do you have a spare change?"
"Glad you like it."
"Judge for yourself."
"Yeah, I can do that."
"Both of you shut up."
"Use your intuition."
"You can make your dreams come true."
"I've had enough."
"You owe me one."
"Now go home."
"Ladies, please."
"Do you want to do this here?"
"I'm waiting to see that."
"You look distracted."
"I thought I was done."
"I'm in business."
"I was going to take a shower."
"They were shot at."
"He gives without expecting anything."
"What's your name, honey?"
"And I liked it."
"This wine is good."
"I'll give you some advice."
"It's always a good sign."
"I tried twice."
"I'll give you the lowdown."
"A long journey awaits us."
"The two machines before half."
"As if it were easy."
"Do you exercise?"
"He is a former military man."
"It's the same guy."
"But you have to be careful."
"What do I have left?"
"I saw your ship."
"I'll get you out of here."
"This is really very important."
"She's my only friend."
"Call it what you want."
"You need a drink."
"Go easy on her."
"Who needs money?"
"Where are you going so fast?"
"Where are you going so fast?"
"His father's son."
"I like your friends."
"What else is there?"
"Someone took them."
"Are you coming for a coffee?"
"The case was closed."
"No, that's my name."
"It has become a habit."
"I would do the same thing."
"What's the surprise?"
"It's a simple exchange."
"But you like him."
"You don't ask any."
"We got the shooter."
"I'm proud of him."
"Did she ask you?"
"We are looking for a new life."
"You can leave a message."
"Beth is in the hospital."
"I had a lot of fun."
"This is my first choice."
"Do you want to visit the house?"
"I keep calling."
"Do you feel the same way?"
"You need a lawyer."
"You have trained us well."
"Can I trust you?"
"The third flower is green."
"Have you read my book?"
"You have to get rid of it."
"We'll have you examined."
"But what else to do?"
"Look how pretty it is."
"And that scares them."
"You taught me that."
"I would recognize him among a thousand."
"I hear the bells ringing."
"Just go ahead."
"They are doing their best."
"Have you seen him lately?"
"It looks beautiful."
"He's yours now."
"And you, where were you?"
"When did you meet him?"
"What did I do to them?"
"Want to see more?"
"I can answer that."
"She told me."
"You don't believe her?"
"We feel good at home."
"Who do I think I am?"
"Put this in the trunk."
"I like your house."
"I just wanted to talk to you."
"The road is still long."
"Do you need this?"
"Can we afford it?"
"Do you have any on you?"
"We did our duty."
"I keep it on me."
"But what are you going to do?"
"At your command, Captain."
"I'll go through the back."
"I'm with the group."
"How does it feel to you?"
"I'm just taking a look."
"He was there this morning."
"I made a copy."
"There was a party."
"Focus on the moment."
"Do you want to go talk to him?"
"I made cookies."
"No, don't touch me."
"I can't hear it anymore."
"Can you pass it to me?"
"You have all the time in the world."
"I gave him some."
"That's what I thought."
"How is he doing?"
"From head to toe."
"Was this your first time?"
"Oh, that's very pretty."
"And how do you know that?"
"I bet you it does."
"No, we'll get there."
"It reminds me of a story."
"I forgot the keys."
"I'm asking you a favor."
"So that's how it is?"
"Yours and mine."
"Have I made myself clear?"
"I'll get them for you."
"I have to go home."
"You look like your mother."
"But I trust you."
"How long has she been here?"
"You're acting like a child."
"What did you do?"
"It's a bit high."
"What was his name again?"
"No, you stay here."
"Do you mind if I call?"
"I return to my office."
"He is ours now."
"I'll get the papers."
"I have to call my daughter."
"You're not making any effort."
"You're a good cop."
"I came to say goodbye to him."
"Yes, it's going well."
"You're late."
"There were traffic jams."
"You are a pretty girl."
"I wanted to get rid of it."
"Weeks ago."
"We were in the area."
"Both."
"No, don't leave me."
"Because you're right."
"You always liked it."
"He came by this morning."
"I've loved you for a long time."
"It lives up to its name."
"Not that long ago."
"She called the police."
"Maybe next week."
"No more than an hour."
"Did you see the match?"
"You have reached your destination."
"Have you ever seen any?"
"I want to speak to the chief."
"Don't you want to see her?"
"I prefer the great outdoors."
"Would you please follow me?"
"Can I have a cigarette?"
"Someone we know?"
"It was for the smell."
"Yes, it was."
"It happened very quickly."
"I feel perfectly fine."
"Will there be girls?"
"Something must be done."
"Didn't they tell you?"
"I'm going to mass."
"Can you describe it to me?"
"Bubba was my best friend."
"She never left."
"It was just for fun."
"I'll be in the lobby."
"He is in the hallway."
"What is plan B?"
"Keep an eye on her."
"I did it again."
"Who is responsible for this?"
"They are ready to go."
"If this is your destiny."
"Hey, I have an idea."
"I've barely started."
"Don't you miss him?"
"What's there?"
"I came to tell you."
"Do they all have a system?"
"I closed the door."
"What's your type?"
"And you, where are you going?"
"Where did he go again?"
"You taught me a lot."
"All this hides something else."
"I just wanted to see you."
"They never came."
"He's an ex-cop."
"How can I make up for it?"
"Who closed the door?"
"It was a great day."
"What are our other options?"
"Three bullets in the chest."
"He's going to pay for this."
"Congratulations to both of you."
"Good things happen."
"I'm surprised by you."
"Is that clear?"
"I am safe and sound."
"I slept with you."
"Please, señor."
"I'll find the money."
"Where is he taking her?"
"Or you don't want to?"
"How are you doing, buddy?"
"She was worth it."
"I'll give you my seat."
"Take whichever you want."
"It was the only way."
"Are there any here?"
"Because it was necessary."
"For you, it's over."
"How long will you last?"
"You're out of it."
"I wish I had one."
"I'm talking to you about now."
"Can we count on you?"
"This is censorship."
"She was my grandmother."
"Everything looks delicious."
"Take microbes, for example."
"I only have her."
"No, don't get up."
"Quick, we're late."
"Did you tell them everything?"
"I don't want to."
"I was his best friend."
"We will keep you informed."
"I didn't wake up."
"She didn't listen."
"You have to start somewhere."
"To you and to me."
"Nice to meet you."
"I'll find his number."
"And keep me posted."
"I can't even imagine."
"I did him a favor."
"Where is she hiding?"
"Please let me know."
"I have to see my father."
"But something has changed."
"He went through."
"How are they doing?"
"Blend in."
"He came this morning."
"He's on the plane."
"You never came back."
"And what do I do now?"
"Can I turn on the radio?"
"Do you live with someone?"
"What do you mean by 'naked'?"
"What is this job?"
"Yes, you need it."
"Have you seen the newspapers?"
"We must continue to negotiate."
"Thank you very much for dinner."
"I'm still the same."
"Of course, that's true."
"He does have a name."
"Let me take a picture."
"Does my father know?"
"Do you have a better one?"
"I read this book."
"He made a choice."
"I need cash."
"Let's see where we are."
"I saw them."
"I live just around the corner."
"Is there any beer left?"
"You're supposed to be resting."
"What did I see?"
"They know who we are."
"They went home."
"Whatever he wants."
"Have you seen my husband?"
"Only you can do it."
"Why are you interested in it?"
"I'll give you one."
"He has the right to do so."
"I'll tell you."
"You did very well."
"You'd better back off."
"So join us."
"I've read them all."
"I wouldn't mind."
"Did she take drugs?"
"That's a fact."
"No, don't tell him anything."
"Just a day or two."
"And I'll tell you."
"He looks adorable."
"You have beautiful eyes."
"You don't really think so."
"Everyone, gather around."
"I'll send you the address."
"Do you want a cold one?"
"Nice to meet you."
"We've come this far."
"We'll be there in a few minutes."
"Have a drink with me."
"I have to find a solution."
"Why are you still here?"
"Give me a reasonable time frame."
"He has a history, doctor."
"Who do you want to talk to?"
"And I'm happy about it."
"How does he know?"
"You're on my team."
"Can I have your number?"
"Did you take the money?"
"Because they can."
"I want to go see him."
"Do you have a better idea?"
"Thank God it's over."
"I'm not there yet."
"All the signs are there."
"It's part of the contract."
"Do you already have someone?"
"Well, it is."
"They changed cars."
"Yours or mine?"
"Answer if you're there."
"I am with a client."
"Have you seen this woman?"
"I'm going to win this time."
"You're not following me?"
"We can read you."
"This is a preliminary hearing."
"Anakin was a good friend."
"Was your day good?"
"Do you want more of me?"
"And that's me."
"I would really like to talk to you."
"It's made for you."
"You don't love him anymore?"
"There is a void."
"Have you told me everything?"
"At least, I think so."
"I received my orders."
"Who's in the closet?"
"But you don't want to."
"This forest is mine."
"One behind the other."
"But you know it now?"
"Maybe they are right."
"This is the real truth."
"I can't swallow anything."
"Dad told me."
"That's what we call it."
"You don't want to say anything?"
"Did you win the lottery?"
"This is the best idea."
"We're fine like this."
"He's around."
"I put an end to it."
"I really like your work."
"What am I to you?"
"He's a real tough guy."
"Are you in or not?"
"I am the Chancellor's Ambassador."
"Do you think you can do better?"
"Did he contact you?"
"I am trustworthy."
"Have you ever seen this?"
"I take it all on myself."
"You do it very well."
"Give him space."
"He is a great artist."
"How much did you give him?"
"You have to choose your side."
"Shall I make you a coffee?"
"I will do the same."
"That's all for him."
"Don't forget my secret."
"Are you old friends?"
"Give me some good news."
"It looks real."
"She is on the roof."
"Are you in?"
"He overdosed."
"It all started from there."
"She is in a safe place."
"Yes, that's exactly it."
"When is the audition?"
"But how can we be sure?"
"They are in the kitchen."
"I almost was."
"I should have prevented this."
"I didn't want to."
"I can do it, Dad."
"What do we need?"
"I did it yesterday."
"This is what you do."
"You are a wonderful man."
"Well, can we go?"
"It's in my room."
"I just got them."
"Who do you think we are?"
"I went to your house."
"Maybe we'll see each other."
"I have influence."
"You look very good."
"I have sensitive skin."
"He took my son."
"We made our decision."
"I am a good doctor."
"I should have known."
"I must see the king."
"You'll see, you'll like it."
"You should have said so."
"The other side of what?"
"It's just noise."
"I just wanted to say thank you."
"Or something else."
"You have a lot to do."
"You're the expert."
"I want to see the world."
"It suits everyone."
"Are you going to stay a while?"
"What are you going to do, huh?"
"You can stay at my place."
"This is my toy."
"I need a tuxedo."
"You heard your father."
"We are very grateful to you."
"You are an educated man."
"And how do you know that?"
"It comes from my father."
"You wouldn't."
"They came in through there."
"Why did you bring her?"
"I would be very happy."
"No one should ever learn this."
"I have to tell you."
"I want to see the director."
"You're going to get out of here."
"It's a nice word."
"Have you always lived here?"
"And I want the truth."
"My papers are in order."
"My place is with you."
"What is the occasion?"
"But we must act quickly."
"You're not together?"
"It is a hidden city."
"It's against my religion."
"It's a special evening."
"He looks strong."
"It must be like this."
"What happened?"
"Is that your boss?"
"Not at the expense of the present."
"It happened so fast."
"How can you say that?"
"It's in a day."
"I already knew that."
"Everything looks perfect."
"I swear to my God."
"I will count the votes."
"And you, what do you think?"
"I'll pass it to you."
"We heard shots."
"You're the crazy one."
"Did they come to see you?"
"He is on the way."
"He has an appointment."
"But what time is it?"
"I remember him."
"You were a good apprentice."
"How are you doing since then?"
"You already have an apprentice."
"Is everyone whole?"
"Can you take care of it?"
"Did you get to see it?"
"A connection with the planet."
"I'm going to find a job."
"I did both."
"Have you seen my father?"
"I'm going to make more coffee."
"But you just arrived."
"Do you like baseball?"
"She was my girlfriend."
"That's the first thing."
"No, I'm sure of it."
"Don't you understand?"
"I admire your work very much."
"You know, you're right."
"You are a good agent."
"You don't have to."
"Everything is fine, my angel."
"Come to my office tomorrow."
"For real this time."
"And where is your mother?"
"It's their livelihood."
"He is in the hospital."
"Something happened to me."
"Can we talk a little?"
"It was a great moment."
"I do it myself."
"The throne ship is approaching."
"Maybe not."
"I just stopped by to say hello."
"I would like to go with you."
"The principle is the same."
"I'll let you go."
"What do you want to show me?"
"Dad, I can do it."
"You should talk to him about it."
"He knows where I live."
"I knew she would come back."
"But why are you doing this?"
"I saw you too."
"Susie told me."
"What are you going to call it?"
"The girl is coming with me."
"This is my little cousin."
"Welcome home, son."
"Something must have happened."
"I've already planned everything."
"We are good people."
"Do you want to know a secret?"
"I'm not shaved."
"Did he take something?"
"It's a long list."
"Get on all fours."
"I couldn't say."
"What will it be used for?"
"This is a great opportunity."
"It's steel."
"I understand you very well."
"I was in the neighborhood."
"What is he getting involved in?"
"You need a doctor."
"You need a doctor."
"I didn't hide anything."
"You're going to tell me everything."
"The target is moving."
"We are on the same side."
"I'll keep that in mind."
"Tickets, please."
"She is a remarkable woman."
"Everyone wants it."
"You will hear from me."
"Do you want to go that way?"
"So, who are you betting on?"
"I'm going to see my son."
"I've done enough."
"Do you know where to find it?"
"Do we have everyone?"
"How did you meet him?"
"I'll owe you one."
"Is it the same helicopter?"
"I'll text you."
"Your attention determines your reality."
"Is it alcohol?"
"We don't touch anything."
"He shits on people."
"Here's how we're going to do it."
"But I'm coming with you."
"Do you know all these people?"
"You are as you are."
"Sixth, at the end of the corridor."
"What did you say to him?"
"Who is she talking to?"
"We must be very close."
"Yes, it was very good."
"He owes me a favor."
"Think of yourself first."
"No, I have work."
"Where is he anyway?"
"You look happy."
"Everyone knows that."
"Glad you came."
"I'll drop you a line."
"What is this room?"
"You're tough, aren't you?"
"It belonged to my father."
"You'd better come inside."
"You look nice."
"Who are the others?"
"I followed your advice."
"Where is the other half?"
"Answer yes or no."
"How do you remember it?"
"This path is hidden from me."
"I do everything myself."
"How can you not love them?"
"Have fun, girls."

"But the situation has changed."
"Don't call me that."
"I know, I'll take you."
"Not at all, my dear."
"You've done your time."
"Do you want some music?"

"It's easy to check."
"At the house's expense."
"Yes, she is very pretty."
"It will be good for you."
"You must be very excited."

"Your intuition was right."
"We are approaching the house."
"Did you pay for this?"
"He explained everything to me."
"Do you want to go for a walk?"
"Are you Miss December?"
"It's just a suggestion."
"Can I have the definition?"
"You should see a doctor."
"I was talking about my career."
"I'm going to make dinner."
"Who is he to you?"
"It has to be real."
"You heard the doctor."
"How are you, darling?"
"How are you, my dear?"
"Do you read lips?"
"You fought well."
"Someone wants to see you."
"Have you changed your mind?"
"The Federation is absent."
"It's a good cause."
"Do you know where they are?"
"I heard very well."
"I just want to rest."
"But where do they come from?"
"A commission must be created."
"They are in the hospital."
"Wait, I'll explain."
"This promises to be interesting."
"To end up like the others?"
"I was blindfolded."
"Can you come back later?"
"There are eight of them."
"It's a great party."
"Anything else."
"The kid, in the well."
"No one can enter it."
"We have a big day."
"They are all my friends."

"Nice to see you."
"What year is it?"
"How many did you take?"
"How does it work for you?"
"Just things."
"Downstairs, in the basement."
"Show me how it works."
"How much did he say?"
"I never see them."
"He's a little genius."
"He became a man."
"Since I was little."
"We are on the scene."
"Just a little water."
"Close the exit signs."
"He was in the car."
"It will never happen again."
"Something bit me."
"You are tough in business."
"I don't think so anymore."
"Nice to have met you."
"I'll meet you downstairs."
"Is this the right way?"
"It was a great idea."
"If you don't mind."
"You are her best friend."
"We captured the queen."
"I don't argue."
"How about a beer?"
"Can he do something?"
"Put it back in its place."
"Keep your eyes wide open."
"Is he coming?"
"Are you dating someone?"
"What's with that accent?"
"I thought you knew."
"I'll find one."
"She won't."
"Not as good as me."
"And the handbag."
"Do you think he'll come back?"
"Does he make you wash it?"
"He is in the living room."
"Mom, what are you doing here?"
"No one helped me."
"You must have a reason."
"I have an excellent memory."
"I'll send you a car."
"Where did you find it?"
"You are a good guy."
"Is he talking?"
"Do you remember her?"
"That's a lot, I imagine."
"What did you do to them?"
"I didn't say anything."
"It's a real job."
"It all started like this."
"You can, if you want."
"What was that voice?"
"Prepare the ship to jump."
"We can still do it."
"Let me be clearer."
"I press the button."
"But you will do it."
"I hope you like it."
"What do you have to say?"
"I saw you talking."
"I have always been independent."
"If you are there, answer."
"These are his own words."
"I taste, daughter of Isis."
"I wanted to do something."
"She's my daughter too."
"I'm one too."
"It was before the war."
"Sorry for waking you up."
"Very nice to meet you."
"That must have been hard."
"I'm going to call a doctor."
"Tell them who you are."
"What is this construction site?"
"Did I do that?"
"How is he doing?"
"I just wanted to have fun."
"How are you this morning?"
"He is on parole."
"She looks like it."
"It was his last wish."
"You're going to have fun."
"He's still a kid."
"Thank you very much for being here."
"Glad you like it."
"What did you put in it?"
"What happened to my angel?"
"I'll take care of that."
"I heard someone."
"How are you doing?"
"It's psychology."
"How did it happen?"
"This is confidential information."
"Are you taking care of him?"
"You seem like a good fit for me."
"This is the classic move."
"He still knows, right?"
"How do you know how to do that?"
"Where did you learn it?"
"It was just an argument."
"I like it that way."
"Would you mind relaxing?"
"She is an intelligent woman."
"Can you be more specific?"
"Now go to your room."
"It's a civil war."
"Take a closer look."
"Several years ago."
"I'll make you dinner."
"His car is parked in front."
"Can I have an advance?"
"Can't you hear them?"
"He has a new family."
"You three, come with me."
"Can we go around?"
"Ah, it's nothing."
"What's up, old man?"
"An order is an order."
"Do you want to watch TV?"
"That's exactly how it is."
"Why is he telling you this?"
"Put this against the wall."
"I don't know anything about it."
"Smoke and mirrors."
"What is it about?"
"You come home early."
"Charming, isn't it?"
"Even I know that."
"I'm a pilot too."
"She has a lot of imagination."
"I am safe."
"I'll see you tonight."
"What does he work in?"
"Not sure?"
"What is the theme?"
"I have asthma."
"Did you call the doctor?"
"And a bottle of water."
"I see it in you."
"They're all the same."
"Are there any messages?"
"For You are with me."
"It's a bit big."
"You just talk."
"The floor is yours."
"I have a life."
"Put whatever you want."
"He took my car."
"It never ends."
"Do you want to stay like this?"

"You have to think of everything."
"You will be proud of me."
"I took one."
"You are a true gentleman."
"We need to think."
"How are you, my friend?"
"To your diving stations."
"And once there?"
"The voice of reason."
"I'll tell you later."
"She's still in the operating room."
"It's a pretty ring."
"You should have seen it."
"What is this money?"
"The answer is over there."
"Who wants to be first?"
"Don't talk about her."
"And I do mine."
"This is what will happen."
"Where are you going with that?"
"But for good reasons."
"I should come more often."
"I never thought about it."
"I never thought about it."
"What are we celebrating?"
"Sorry to keep you waiting."

"Oh, for heaven's sake."
"You know I will."
"It's about me."
"No, I'm not well."
"What's holding you back?"
"I'm at the end of my rope."
"Let me ask you something."
"How did he take it?"
"What would that change?"
"I know she's there."
"How are things going there?"
"She has the right to know."
"I will do whatever you want."
"I need to change."
"I brought you flowers."
"Do you hear what you're saying?"
"That's where you come in."
"What are you doing here?"
"I need to rest."
"There is light."
"Go ahead, please."
"I didn't write that."
"What is true?"
"The pleasure is all ours."
"It's very close from here."
"I think you know that."
"I think you know that."
"You know what I want."
"It's hilarious."
"You still don't understand?"
"Sorry about earlier."
"Where have you been?"
"This is really not the time."
"You shouldn't say that."
"I think it's him."
"Do you want me to take you back?"
"What do you think?"
"What do you think?"
"What would you do in my place?"
"What did you want?"
"What is all this?"
"Dad, what's going on?"
"Give him what he wants."
"As long as it takes."
"I am what I am."
"She didn't say that."
"Whose idea was it?"
"I know what you're going through."
"You were lucky."
"Do you need anything?"
"I'll try to remember that."
"We both are."
"Just like the good old days."
"No, it's not over."
"What's up?"
"I love you more than anything."
"I hadn't seen it."
"You have to believe me."
"There it is, I have it."
"I am glad to see you."
"But you won't."
"He'll be here in a minute."
"I would like to show you something."
"I would like to show you something."
"How do you expect me to know?"
"When was the last time?"
"I think it's good."
"I told him about you."
"No, I haven't seen it."
"I've been there before."
"You know what I'm thinking?"
"The past is the past."
"I'm tired of waiting."
"I know what it looks like."
"I see what you're doing."
"What did he do to you?"
"But I didn't."
"This had never happened to me."
"I have no choice anymore."
"I'm going to ask you to leave."
"And you know what else?"
"Isn't that the truth?"
"No, that's out of the question."
"There was an incident."
"Have you heard of me?"
"I know who did this."
"I thought it was me."
"Hey, what's going on?"
"That's all there is to it."
"Thank you for picking me up."
"Tell him how you feel."
"And what did he say?"
"I want to ask you a question."
"I need an answer."
"Look what I did."
"She was lucky."
"I saw light."
"Did you spend the night here?"
"She couldn't come."
"Do you want to join me?"
"We both are."
"Nothing matters anymore."
"This is your chance."
"I only think of you."
"It never was."
"That's what was planned."
"Can we move on?"
"Do you want something to eat?"
"There's more to it than that."
"Did the flight go well?"
"Come sit next to me."
"Look on the bright side."
"Would you like something to drink?"
"I'm looking forward to it."
"Is it because of that?"
"He does what he wants."
"Let them go to hell."
"And that's a good thing."
"One more, please."
"You don't know anything about me."
"My God, what have I done?"
"I did everything I could."
"You have nothing to say?"
"You did a good job."
"What are you singing?"
"Did you tell him about me?"
"It will only take a few minutes."
"I have no one else."
"I made it myself."
"I need a name."
"Because I want to."
"I don't have a son."
"I'll see you at home."
"I knew it from the beginning."
"I know you know that."
"Tell him I love him."
"I need a cigarette."
"Of course I know him."
"Do you receive me?"
"We are on the right track."
"I know you will."
"Whatever the cost."
"What did they want?"
"It's a staging."
"I need a pick-me-up."
"And you didn't say anything?"
"No, not everything is fine."
"I've got my eye on you."
"I've got my eye on you."
"I've got my eye on you."
"It's a matter of respect."
"That's what we want."
"No, I didn't say anything."
"I want to see all the plans."
"I don't have a wife."
"We have work to do."
"No one comes in or goes out."
"I moved on."
"Only one way to find out."
"I want her to be happy."
"I was hoping you'd say that."
"What kind of man are you?"
"What kind of man are you?"
"I read that somewhere."
"I wanted to tell you."
"I have a job to do."
"I ask myself the same question."
"No, there is no one."
"I found it like this."
"What happened?"
"I can manage on my own."
"I bought you a present."
"This name rings a bell."
"Do you think I like it?"
"It's a matter of survival."
"Can I ask you a favor?"
"I'm going to ask you some questions."
"What do you have to tell me?"
"He is a friend of mine."
"You need to rest."
"What do you want me to do?"
"Do you know what he does?"
"What did you hope for?"
"Please forgive me."
"Please forgive me."
"See you inside."
"Don't you want to go?"
"What interests you?"
"I'll take care of everything."
"I'll make a phone call."
"What did she tell you?"
"I never loved you."
"I have to find her."
"We are from the same family."
"He has the right to know."
"What the hell are we doing?"
"It's on the house."
"Can I have a word with you?"
"They can't be far away."
"Because I said so."
"Do you remember his name?"
"You want me to do it?"
"I thought you were gone."
"You only think about that."
"You didn't know?"
"What do you want us to do?"
"What do you want us to do?"
"I suspected it a little."
"Let me show you something."
"I've always been like this."
"Would you like some water?"
"What do you hear?"
"One second, please."
"You know who I'm talking about."
"You know who I'm talking about."
"It's a matter of honor."
"What's going on outside?"
"I'll join you in a minute."
"I would if I could."
"What's he up to?"
"Please listen to me."
"It's Christmas Eve."
"That's what I mean."
"What is he looking for?"
"I'm so proud of you."
"It's me you want."
"It's me you want."
"How much time does he have left?"
"See what you can do."
"No, it's not you."
"What can we do for you?"
"I did it for you."
"I think that's it."
"You have nothing to do?"
"That's what it looks like."
"I live from day to day."
"Of course she is."
"I see it in your eyes."
"Here's what I'm going to do."
"That's where we're going."
"See you inside."
"It's nice to see you."
"I told you about him."
"We have a job to do."
"He's just a kid."
"It's far from over."
"There are a lot of people."
"That's what you do."
"I had things to do."
"What did you want to talk to me about?"
"I have to ask you a question."
"Who do you want it to be?"
"I want to hear you say it."
"I needed to see you."
"Because I'm a woman?"
"I love what I do."
"That's what he believes."
"You never were."
"I thought it was settled."
"He must be somewhere."
"What is love?"
"I'll get us something to drink."
"Don't you agree?"
"Everyone saw it."
"I wish you a good day."
"This is where I live."
"We learn something new every day."
"I never wanted it."
"I need a car."
"Do you know how to use this?"
"I need your signature."
"I think he likes you."
"I've seen this before."
"No, I didn't do anything."
"How are you so sure?"
"What do we have?"
"I wanted to ask you something."
"I wanted to ask you something."
"I've seen others."
"What does this have to do with me?"
"I know what that means."
"Nobody knows where she is."
"This is what we want."
"That's what I hope."
"It depends on your point of view."
"It's my day off."
"Do you know what that feels like?"
"You need to calm down."
"We must move forward."
"I'll take care of them."
"I'll be back later."
"I think it's over."
"I agree with her."
"Not that I remember."
"I hope everything goes well."
"Where am I going?"
"Honey, what's wrong?"
"I know you can."
"Do you see what I'm talking about?"
"I brought you a gift."
"I know you love him."
"Come on guys, let's go."
"I'll take that as a no."
"I hope you're right."
"I'll tell you later."
"Calm down, please."
"I am delighted to meet you."
"She is nothing to me."
"I'm glad to hear it."
"I take it as a compliment."
"That's absolutely correct."
"How much time do I have left?"
"But what is it?"
"He told me about you."
"He told me about you."
"What is he?"
"I know you want it."
"I have to see you."
"Did you have a good evening?"
"I thought I saw something."
"That's what we wanted."
"Everyone please stay calm."
"What happened yesterday?"
"Of course it's me."
"I've never been there."
"This is what I expected."
"So what's going on?"
"The countdown has begun."
"There are cameras everywhere."
"You need to rest."
"What's over?"
"It was the right thing to do."
"This is a golden opportunity."
"I always wanted one."
"You know how spies are."
"You know what I see?"
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"I've never felt like this."
"It's about you."
"I think that's clear."
"No, we are not."
"How long did it last?"
"I thought of something."
"I thought of something."
"Where are you?"
"I'll find someone else."
"I have feelings for you."
"We'll talk about it another time."
"This is what it is about."
"I'll make you some coffee."
"You just have to ask."
"Can I talk to you for a moment?"
"I have to get back to work."
"I didn't believe it."
"How can you be sure?"
"How can you be sure?"
"No, that won't be necessary."
"I hope you like it."
"Come take a ride with me."
"Everything you need."
"I just said it like that."
"Do you want me to go?"
"Tell me what it is."
"Are you seeing someone else?"
"Please go ahead."
"Please go ahead."
"Yes, I told you."
"What will happen?"
"How are you going to do it?"
"I need to think about it."
"There are thousands of them."
"I did it for myself."
"No, she's not well."
"I would like to ask you a question."
"Maybe it's a sign."
"What will you do?"
"It's good for business."
"Fill up, please."
"I had never seen one."
"Peace be with you."
"Did she say anything?"
"You don't want to talk to me?"
"I never knew him."
"It's our honeymoon."
"Like rock water."
"Of course you are."
"What does he look like?"
"I'm so happy for you."
"I'm so happy for you."
"Nice to meet you."
"I have to tell you something."
"What do you mean by that?"
"I'm going home."
"I prefer not to say it."
"Did you give him a name?"
"Do you think it's him?"
"I don't have a husband."
"I love what you do."
"This is what you have to do."
"I didn't say otherwise."
"A little over a year."
"She's a tough cookie."
"So what's the plan?"
"This can't be it."
"And you, what are you going to do?"
"How did you get this number?"
"No, I didn't say that."
"How did he do that?"
"What do we hear?"
"I can take care of that."
"I am only a messenger."
"I want to kiss you."
"He's just a man."
"What really happened?"
"What are you going to do with him?"
"No, I don't."
"It will only take a moment."
"That's very kind of you."
"It's meal time."
"I don't know anything about you."
"Tell him you love him."
"Can I drop you off somewhere?"
"There is water."
"What about him?"
"I was thinking the same thing."
"That's what I meant."
"What's all the noise?"
"It's three o'clock in the morning."
"Can you tell me your name?"
"I don't want any excuses."
"What does he know?"
"Yes, what's going on?"
"This is what I need."
"I think it's great."
"I believe what I see."
"How much time do we have left?"
"How much time do we have left?"
"You have to do it."
"Are you okay with that?"
"Do you agree with that?"
"I have bills to pay."
"This is what we need."
"I guess you're right."
"That's an understatement."
"It's a point of view."
"Listen to me, please."
"Listen to me, please."
"I may have a solution."
"This is just the beginning."
"This is what is happening."
"I'll tell him the truth."
"Give me a hand."
"You would have done the same thing."
"I knew this day would come."
"That's nice of you."
"I'm done with you."
"What do you mean?"
"Do you want me to talk to him?"
"I don't have a father."
"What's in the bag?"
"I'll get us out of here."
"What are you holding?"
"Is that how you feel?"
"It's me they want."
"I'll give you a hint."
"I love you just the way you are."
"What exactly did he say?"
"It's a defense mechanism."
"I have another appointment."
"How did we get here?"
"I think he likes me."
"You know it's true."
"You're going to need this."
"When are you coming back?"
"Stand up, please."
"He's just a baby."
"I'm just doing my job."
"I didn't say that."
"It's time for me to go."
"You could have told me."
"I know how you feel."
"No, he wasn't."
"How was your day?"
"You don't have family?"
"No, you won't."
"More than you think."
"You didn't know?"
"I know you like it."
"I must leave you."
"That's one way of looking at it."
"You're just a child."
"He has to go to the hospital."
"He knows I'm here."
"Until the end of time."
"And it still is."
"I believe that's true."
"I just wanted to tell you."
"No, I don't believe you."
"Do you want me to walk you home?"
"Do you think it's me?"
"You think it's me?"
"Do you think it's me?"
"See you at school."
"Would you like a cup of tea?"
"I don't have a brother."
"They are not mine."
"It's our lucky day."
"It's time for you to go."
"It's a nice leg for me."
"It looks pretty good."
"Can I give you some advice?"
"Let this be a lesson to you."
"Let this be a lesson to you."
"I don't see anything else."
"You know as much as I do."
"Glad you could come."
"Glad you could come."
"How much time is left?"
"The deal is in the bag."
"I want to speak to a lawyer."
"I'll show you your room."
"I'll show you your room."
"It happened so fast."
"I did not order this."
"Did you want to tell me something?"
"I'll leave you both."
"Can I show you something?"
"Can I show you something?"
"I said it was fine."
"Can I get you a drink?"
"There is always one."
"She didn't tell you anything?"
"Maybe I will."
"What do you think?"
"You'll do just fine."
"I need a doctor."
"It's me who thanks you."
"I know what happened."
"No, it's not nothing."
"You're doing the right thing."
"I know he's here."
"Maybe that's why."
"I had a long day."
"This is what I think about it."
"Is it serious?"
"But this is the last time."
"Tell us what you know."
"I called everyone."
"Yes, I remember you."
"I would like to introduce you to someone."
"I'll go see who it is."
"Do we know each other?"
"I want to know who it is."
"What exactly happened?"
"I'll tell you something else."
"What do you think it is?"
"I'll be here for a while."
"He knows we're here."
"I say what I want."
"That's all in the past."
"No, that wasn't it."
"No, I don't like it."
"I never said that."
"We'll talk about that later."
"I need to know."
"I would like to ask you something."
"You know how I feel."
"Leave me alone, please."
"Can I tell you something?"
"Can I tell you something?"
"I think about it every day."
"I came as quickly as possible."
"Something is going to happen."
"This is a piece of evidence."
"Maybe it was an accident."
"Something happened to me."
"You don't want to talk about it?"
"Do what you have to do."
"I am an FBI agent."
"That's what she wanted."
"I know how he feels."
"We need you here."
"Let's see what you can do."
"That's what you are."
"I'm glad to be here."
"I'm glad to be here."
"I think you should leave."
"I think you should leave."
"But you won't."
"When did it start?"
"That's it, I get it."
"It's because of you."
"We had some good times."
"Do you have someone else?"
"I've seen all your movies."
"Have you ever seen this man?"
"I have an important meeting."
"I tried to talk to him."
"I have a train to catch."
"Can I see you for a minute?"
"Can I see you for a minute?"
"Leave her out of it."
"There is another option."
"Did you cut your hair?"
"Who else could it be?"
"You're a good person."
"We're not talking about me."
"I never thought about it."
"I thought I heard a noise."
"You can't always win."
"How did she take it?"
"It doesn't matter anymore."
"I heard about you."
"There is always a solution."
"I need you here."
"Can I see you for a second?"
"What will it be?"
"Do you want to go home?"
"I might have a lead."
"I have a job for you."
"I have a job for you."
"He knows what he's talking about."
"I know, right?"
"Of course I want to."
"Can I speak to you in private?"
"You didn't tell him?"
"Maybe that's true."
"That's a good idea, right?"
"I told you the truth."
"Did you say something to him?"
"I'm going to tell you a secret."
"I wish you a good night."
"I did it once."
"I'm glad to see you."
"I'm glad to see you."
"I'll tell you about it later."
"Is he a friend of yours?"
"Is he a friend of yours?"
"There is something there."
"What are you implying?"
"Where are they?"
"I realized it."
"She does what she wants."
"I came to say goodbye."
"We have a plane to catch."
"Is it me you're looking for?"
"It's in all the newspapers."
"Do you know what it was?"
"Maybe it's a coincidence."
"As if I had a choice."
"I don't want him."
"It's between you and me."
"I think he's right."
"Do you know why you are here?"
"No, it's not there."
"No, it's not."
"Is this her?"
"I didn't think you'd come."
"I have some things to take care of."
"Do you think it's easy?"
"I need a lawyer."
"How could I have forgotten?"
"What do you think it is?"
"We'll meet at the car."
"I am one of your fans."
"Let me ask you something."
"I'm really proud of you."
"Where do I sign?"
"We were lucky."
"What are you hiding?"
"She can't be far away."
"You are not a man."
"No, he didn't say anything."
"Where were you last night?"
"This is what I did."
"Mom, what's going on?"
"That's what we think."
"I am only the messenger."
"When are we leaving?"
"Look on the bright side."
"I know it's you."
"It's the house that treats."
"No, I didn't see anything."
"You'll find out soon enough."
"There is a big difference."
"It's completely natural."
"It never was."
"I should have trusted you."
"I wanted to see you."
"I didn't choose it."
"I would like to ask you a few questions."
"I'm going to go for a walk."
"No, I don't mind."
"That's what I was talking about."
"You're lucky."
"I told you so, didn't I?"
"I told you, didn't I?"
"I need your car."
"What's in there?"
"I think I'm pregnant."
"I'm just saying, I'm not saying anything."
"I tried to tell him."
"I never get tired of it."
"I'll meet you at home."
"Tomorrow is the big day."
"We need to talk to him."
"You're going to have to trust me."
"What are you into?"
"I had a great evening."
"What is his last name?"
"I have news for you."
"I have news for you."
"I can take care of him."
"We can do better than that."
"I had a little accident."
"She has no choice."
"Can I ask you something?"
"Can I ask you something?"
"She had no choice."
"I swear on my life."
"Did you have a good day?"
"I didn't go there."
"We'll take care of that."
"This is one of my favorites."
"Is that understood?"
"I have things in hand."
"Is this what you are looking for?"
"There is so much to do."
"I'll be there in a minute."
"There is another reason."
"I see it in his eyes."
"I have to go to school."
"Do you have what it takes?"
"Let me show you something."
"It's great to see you."
"This is where I work."
"I said it first."
"I gave you an order."
"Where did you get this idea?"
"I'm going to get myself something to drink."
"I have a statement to make."
"I need a beer."
"Let's see what we have here."
"Do you have any brothers or sisters?"
"Thank you for coming."
"Give him some time."
"It works both ways."
"Do I know you?"
"I have it in front of me."
"Where is she going?"
"How did you find this place?"
"The sun will rise soon."
"It's time for dinner."
"Sounds perfect to me."
"I see through your game."
"Everyone did it."
"I need your opinion."
"It will be for next time."
"No, I told you."
"No, I told you."
"It's time to go."
"I'll do it for you."
"You know you want it."
"Did I make myself clear?"
"I swore to protect you."
"I just wanted to hear your voice."
"Is he there?"
"It's not yours."
"What could happen?"
"Everything will be fine."
"Let me take care of this."
"I've had more than enough."
"Smoking is prohibited here."
"I'd better go back."
"No one is safe."
"That's what it is."
"I need to see you."
"I could never do that."
"You're no match for me."
"You're not up to it."
"Can I offer you a drink?"
"Anyone can do it."
"Anyone can do it."
"I met him once."
"Here's what's going to happen."
"I'm going to need you."
"I'm going to need you."
"May the Force be with you."
"I tried to call him."
"I told you no."
"Who told you about this?"
"Do you want to go?"
"Not while I'm here."
"I think I love him."
"I want you to do it."
"Let's see what we can do."
"Can I talk to you for a minute?"
"Would you like a glass of water?"
"Looking for something specific?"
"I had to do it."
"You do what you want."
"When are you coming home?"
"I know who did it."
"You didn't see her."
"What do you choose?"
"What do you suggest?"
"Of course they are."
"I think I found something."
"But you have to trust me."
"Do you know where he went?"
"I'm old school."
"What are the risks?"
"How was the trip?"
"Where are they going?"
"I have to take care of this."
"I want to hear you say it."
"It's been over an hour."
"And you, what are you doing here?"
"You did well."
"What will you take?"
"Calm down, please."
"I'd better go."
"You're just a kid."
"When were you going to tell me?"
"Did it work?"
"This is what I propose to you."
"What would I do?"
"How did you get my number?"
"Do you think you're tough?"
"What are they doing?"
"Did he tell you about me?"
"He never did."
"What happens next?"
"You know, don't you?"
"Do you have anything to add?"
"What would you like?"
"Let it not happen again."
"I mind my own business."
"You have no proof."
"I have to go to the bathroom."
"It's because of him."
"The law is the law."
"Tell me what you have."
"I'm seasick."
"Can I offer you a coffee?"
"Why does everyone say that?"
"What was she saying?"
"You are sure of yourself."
"I have to ask you something."
"Don't kid yourself."
"He didn't tell you?"
"I'm glad to hear that."
"I know it was you."
"Do you know who did this?"
"Do you know who did this?"
"Can we do this later?"
"All right, I'll do it."
"What am I going to do with you?"
"I need the money."
"I need a friend."
"If you will excuse us."
"You never loved me."
"You never did it."
"How can you ask me that?"
"If you don't mind."
"Same as usual."
"I think it's me."
"What is your last name?"
"I think that's all."
"Do you understand me?"
"Can I get you something?"
"You have to start somewhere."
"We have a surprise for you."
"It's easier that way."
"This is where I live."
"It went pretty well."
"She's too good for you."
"The game is worth the candle."
"I feel much better now."
"How did he know?"
"I have to tell you something."
"We have things to do."
"Maybe, I don't know."
"I never told him."
"I bought you something."
"Thank you for joining us."
"I spoke to my father."
"I wanted to say goodbye to you."
"I'm sure it will be fine."
"What kind of man is he?"
"It's about something else."
"No, they are not."
"That's what we thought."
"Are you listening to me?"
"I don't take drugs."
"I'm glad to hear that."
"Don't you read the newspapers?"
"That's what he said."
"What did you want me to say?"
"I need another one."
"What was he saying?"
"I prefer not to think about it."
"I've never been here."
"I've never been here."
"You're right, you're right."
"Would you like a cup of tea?"
"Have you ever been told this?"
"I'll put you on speakerphone."
"Maybe you're right."
"Do you still need me?"
"I want you to take this."
"But everything in its time."
"It's nice to see you again."
"What did he look like?"
"You didn't listen to me?"
"No, I wouldn't say that."
"What more can I do?"
"Is it that obvious?"
"What's happening to them?"
"Are you the one who called?"
"It's between her and me."
"Do you want a cup of coffee?"
"And you, what do you think?"
"I thought you might like it."
"You did well to come."
"You'll have to go over my body."
"I want everything to be perfect."
"You're getting on my nerves."
"I wanted to check on you."
"You want to play it like that?"
"We have the right to know."
"But there's a catch."
"I told him to come."
"Thank you for coming this far."
"Is this a marriage proposal?"
"I feel a little better."
"It's just for a few days."
"I'm going to get myself a drink."
"I had a good day."
"He'll be here in a moment."
"I've been waiting for this moment for a long time."
"You could have told me about it."
"I spoke to your mother."
"Where are you right now?"
"That's what I know."
"And I need you."
"It's you I want."
"He's old school."
"Do you want to play a game?"
"I'm glad to see you again."
"You know what would be good?"
"Is it that important?"
"But you don't know that."
"I will do what I can."
"I want you to take it."
"There is something out there."
"We do what we want."
"I had things to do."
"Where do you think you're going like this?"
"Of course I'm fine."
"It's your turn."
"The choice is yours."
"What does it look like?"
"I have what you want."
"What do you want to talk to me about?"
"In my jacket pocket."
"What were we saying?"
"And what did she say?"
"You can stay if you want."
"I was talking to myself."
"I'm going to show you something."
"Did the trip go well?"
"I had to talk to you."
"They'll be here in a minute."
"I have to find her."
"This is what you have to do."
"I'm glad to see you again."
"I'm glad to see you again."
"It's okay, it's over."
"Can you do me a favor?"
"Can you do me a favor?"
"I don't know what to believe."
"It's bath time."
"What awaits us?"
"It was nice to meet you."
"You and I, it's over."
"I brought you something."
"She can't do that."
"There is something fishy going on."
"Can I ask you a favor?"
"Can I ask you a favor?"
"Please, my God."
"I have homework to do."
"No, she's not."
"What are you reading?"
"What does that mean?"
"How long will it take?"
"What else do you want to know?"
"I need to speak to you in private."
"I can manage on my own."
"Glad you're back."
"You asked to see me?"
"Would you like a glass of wine?"
"I spoke to him this morning."
"It's on the other side."
"What is it, doctor?"
"I'm here to protect you."
"I hope you are happy."
"Everything is going to be fine."
"It was in all the newspapers."
"I wish you much happiness."
"He knows everything."
"Can I talk to you for a moment?"
"Everyone has one."
"That's what they say."
"I have to get back to work."
"We have a lot to say to each other."
"You have to go to the hospital."
"I made the right choice."
"Please calm down."
"I have what I want."
"Do you like what you see?"
"I want to tell you something."
"We will do our best."
"I know you were close."
"No, I'm not saying that."
"It is an honor for me."
"I know how it goes."
"What are you going to do with him?"
"How are things at home?"
"Would you like some water?"
"This is how I see things."
"Let me buy you a drink."
"Thank you for thinking of me."
"I heard about that."
"I'm not sure yet."
"Answer yes or no."
"I'm delighted to be here."
"There's only one left."
"There's only one left."
"She knows what she wants."
"I know you're right."
"No, I'm not going anywhere."
"I'll send you a postcard."
"Please hurry up."
"Something is happening here."
"I hope you're doing well."
"I want to talk to my wife."
"What were you thinking?"
"I almost didn't come."
"It's good to be here."
"No, I'm not going."
"Well, what's left of it."
"I want you to stay here."
"I'm not his father."
"You are safe with me."
"The question does not arise."
"That was a long time ago."
"Are you sure about this?"
"I'll give you some advice."
"This time it's for real."
"Do you think it's over?"
"Do you want to go for a drink?"
"I just got your message."
"What if he doesn't come back?"
"I thought you would be happy."
"Everyone tells me that."
"How was your trip?"
"How was your trip?"
"I have to go to the airport."
"No, there is something else."
"No one comes in or goes out."
"Can I call you back later?"
"It's really important to me."
"I am living proof of that."
"What happened?"
"What does she look like?"
"It was good to see you."
"You know as much as I do."
"Actually, I have to go."
"This is just a theory."
"You think I don't know?"
"I expect nothing less."
"That would be the last straw."
"This is what we are going to do."
"I'll explain something to you."
"Could you do me a favor?"
"Does it matter?"
"I'll take a look at it."
"Do you know what happened?"
"What do you decide?"
"What if he doesn't come?"
"Thanks for earlier."
"There are cops everywhere."
"I'm really happy for you."
"We are what we are."
"Don't you read the newspapers?"
"Take your things and go back to camp."
"No, it's better not."
"I just found out."
"I don't make the rules."
"No, it wasn't me."
"He can't help it."
"I have something to take care of."
"How dare you speak to me like that?"
"I only have one."
"I only have one."
"That's it, it's over."
"We'll find someone else."
"How much time do you need?"
"You've never seen it?"
"I had a great evening."
"It's the gesture that counts."
"I love you, I love you."
"I'll see you at home."
"I'll do better next time."
"He did it for me."
"Is she there?"
"I've seen better days."
"I was the one who called."
"I want you to be there."
"It is out of the question."
"I know it was him."
"And I'll prove it to you."
"He's the one I want."
"You are not the same anymore."
"Do you need anything else?"
"No, you're not going."
"What did he have?"
"It's going to be a long night."
"What is good?"
"Can we join you?"
"I don't know anything about that."
"May I ask your name?"
"We're both going."
"Do you think it's possible?"
"Do you think it's possible?"
"We have to find him."
"We can go wherever we want."
"You can go wherever you want."
"I'm giving you one last chance."
"I will never forgive you."
"No, I'm not interested."
"That's what I like."
"Do you know where it is?"
"Do you know where it is?"
"Do you see what's happening?"
"I almost had a stroke."
"Do you hear what I'm saying?"
"How are things going for you?"
"I will always be by your side."
"What do you have in your hand?"
"How long did I sleep?"
"How long did I sleep?"
"There were deaths."
"What did you want me to do?"
"What did you want me to do?"
"No, I have an appointment."
"I've never seen you."
"I'll join you in a moment."
"There are other solutions."
"You are not yourself anymore."
"She says it's important."
"What are they looking for?"
"You did a great job."
"When will he be back?"
"How could this happen?"
"Of course it's true."
"Glad you could come."
"I can't go anywhere."
"I always wanted to say that."
"I don't even think about it."
"I want us to be together."
"This is a first for me."
"It's my day off."
"We need you here."
"He is a man of honor."
"Do you want me to call him?"
"Do you remember his name?"
"I'm going to teach you something."
"What are you going to do with that?"
"I'm above that."
"It's something else."
"What did you do with him?"
"He does this all the time."
"It's stronger than you."
"We're taking you to the hospital."
"Your father would be proud of you."
"But it didn't happen."
"You know what, you're right."
"Don't make a big deal out of it."
"Did something happen to you?"
"Do you know what it was?"
"Everything you need."
"Are you sure about this?"
"Thank you for coming to see me."
"It's probably better this way."
"Did you see who it was?"
"What are you wearing?"
"Can I have some water?"
"There were others."
"I want to know everything about you."
"I want to know everything about you."
"That's it, it's done."
"I feel great."
"You and I are the same."
"I have a call to make."
"Please do it."
"And everyone knows it."
"So why did you do it?"
"See what you can do."
"I didn't know him."
"Do you have it?"
"What were you told?"
"I thought I'd find you here."
"Let's see what we have."
"That's what's important."
"I don't drink alcohol."
"What's next?"
"Can I ask you some questions?"
"Have you made any friends?"
"Maybe he's right."
"I understand what you are saying."
"It's not love."
"And it's thanks to you."
"Very good, very good, very good."
"What's wrong with that?"
"Do you know why you are here?"
"Do you know why you are here?"
"Do you know why you're here?"
"We're just having fun."
"More than you think."
"I've got you, I've got you."
"This is what I was looking for."
"Did something happen?"
"What are you going to do with us?"
"I hope you like it."
"I'll join you in a minute."
"Not that I know of."
"I think he understood."
"You can do better than that."
"Everyone has a price."
"I had never seen her."
"How do you know who I am?"
"Is anyone in there?"
"It's not yours."
"It's not yours."
"I want you to know that."
"I think he's here."
"Can you do this for me?"
"Do you think what I think?"
"I have something else for you."
"If only it were that simple."
"I'll take a look at it."
"I think it's time."
"I can do it by myself."
"Sorry I scared you."
"I'll get you out of here."
"See you in an hour."
"What do you study?"
"It's as simple as that."
"Do you want us to break up?"
"What were you saying?"
"I take full responsibility for it."
"You've never seen it."
"Not if I can help it."
"You don't have to answer."
"How did you find this place?"
"How did you find this place?"
"I have to see this."
"No, I don't know."
"I'm a little busy right now."
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"What do you prefer?"
"You are more beautiful than ever."
"I think we're ready."
"I know what he wants."
"What the hell is he doing?"
"I think I'm there."
"I thought we were friends."
"No, I'm not finished."
"Do you know what day it is?"
"Let me give you some advice."
"And it's just getting started."
"The first round is on me."
"I did it for him."
"Let's not talk about that now."
"When do we start?"
"That's what's good."
"You did your best."
"I need your advice."
"How did you get on?"
"It was a team effort."
"Is there anyone else?"
"Call me if you need anything."
"I would like to speak to you privately."
"Do you think that's it?"
"I'll get you out of here."
"You can never be too careful."
"He got shot."
"Do you want me to take you?"
"Give him what he wants."
"Are you not well or what?"
"It's part of my job."
"It's part of my job."
"Can you give us a minute?"
"Can you give us a minute?"
"What does he do for a living?"
"It's his day off."
"And you didn't say anything?"
"Do you know where it comes from?"
"What do I risk?"
"You don't have children?"
"He who laughs last laughs best."
"That's what I like."
"You're going to have to trust me."
"I want to see you."
"I spent the night there."
"I know exactly who you are."
"That's what they say."
"Nothing is keeping me here anymore."
"How could he do that?"
"You'd better leave."
"You know what I see?"
"It didn't last long."
"I came to apologize."
"I have to ask you a question."
"I guess it's possible."
"I wonder where he is."
"Is this you?"
"Your tickets, please."
"I'm homesick."
"Can't it wait until tomorrow?"
"I have something for you."
"What did you want to talk to me about?"
"I have a proposition for you."
"I knew you would."
"That's what friends are for."
"I don't ask for more."
"I think it's possible."
"Do you want me to say it?"
"Have you ever done this before?"
"I think I have it."
"Here we go again."
"Sorry it took so long."
"What do we want?"
"I have some time."
"I was just doing my job."
"I'll tell you something else."
"Are you hungry?"
"Aren't you at school?"
"It's self-defense."
"Whose birthday is it?"
"Don't bring her into this."
"There are other options."
"I made you some coffee."
"I have something for him."
"Why are you so sure?"
"Am I right?"
"You know what you're talking about."
"That's one way of doing it."
"What are you doing this weekend?"
"What are they talking about?"
"It was a figure of speech."
"I need the car."
"We have to do it."
"I have plenty more."
"I made you some tea."
"It seems to be working."
"We must take action."
"I have some money."
"I thought you had stopped."
"She is part of the family."
"You're right."
"I like you too."
"I'm going to ask you some questions."
"I have a little idea."
"I have to get up early tomorrow."
"It's a love story."
"I need a moment."
"You don't have any money?"
"This is the only possible explanation."
"This is the Los Angeles Police Department."
"It's written in black and white."
"I need a signature."
"Okay, we get it."
"They all say the same thing."
"In every sense of the word."
"Maybe we should go."
"Show me what you've got."
"Show me what you've got."
"Is there another way out?"
"I wanted to see how you were doing."
"You could say it like that."
"I think it's over."
"I have never been married."
"You can come if you want."
"I have to go."
"This is what we are looking for."
"You can tell me the truth."
"I've had enough of you."
"Looks good to me."
"I went there once."
"You still don't understand?"
"You have your whole life ahead of you."
"I'll be here for an hour."
"You'll find out soon enough."
"Your family needs you."
"You made me a promise."
"I think it is."
"You opened my eyes."
"Well, well, well."
"It's getting late."
"I do what I like."
"Is this about that?"
"Do you think I like this?"
"Okay, here we are."
"My father told me."
"Can we talk in private?"
"I have some work for you."
"You don't want to tell me?"
"I don't want to play."
"Do you want me to tell you?"
"You need to talk to him."
"It's going to be a long day."
"I was just wondering."
"Yes, see you later."
"We will do what is necessary."
"I made them myself."
"I need some fresh air."
"What would you do?"
"It might take some time."
"In a good way."
"You have to see this."
"It's bedtime."
"Do you know what it looks like?"
"This is where I live."
"Where did you learn all this?"
"How are you going to do it?"
"But it was worth it."
"Do you think this will work?"
"Do you think this will work?"
"Can I go to my room?"
"I want us to be friends."
"I'm good for nothing."
"No, I won't do that."
"This is the key to everything."
"Because I'm telling you so."
"Did he say something to you?"
"I worked all night."
"What I always wanted."
"I think I know where he is."
"How can you do this to me?"
"I'm surprised to see you."
"Did he make advances on you?"
"See you at church."
"I'll do it for you."
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
"In another life, perhaps."
"Of course he knows."
"There are millions of them."
"You don't want me?"
"Please leave us."
"It's time for lunch."
"How could it be otherwise?"
"I'm coming to say goodbye to you."
"Can I ask you a favor?"
"I'm feeling great."
"I don't have the answer."
"We had a good time."
"I'm giving you one last chance."
"It's up to you."
"What was I doing?"
"You don't have to."
"We found it like this."
"But you didn't."
"Do you two know each other?"
"In English, please."
"It's a play on words."
"I think we're done."
"That's a good idea."
"Don't bring him into this."
"I give you my word."
"This is probably a good idea."
"What time is your flight?"
"No, he doesn't."
"There is surely an explanation."
"It can't be her."
"I would like to introduce someone to you."
"Did you tell him about us?"
"Have you ever seen this man?"
"That's one good thing done."
"It's tea time."
"I don't expect anything from you."
"Out of sight, out of mind."
"You're doing very well."
"I am just an intermediary."
"It's the moment of truth."
"That's what we wanted."
"How did the interview go?"
"I want you to say it."
"I'm glad to hear it."
"I'm glad to hear it."
"Looks like it worked."
"I need money."
"Let's see what we have here."
"Let's see what we have here."
"All right, I'll take care of it."
"Do you think it's possible?"
"Can I leave him a message?"
"I think they left."
"Two coffees, please."
"I didn't ask him anything."
"Why are you telling me this now?"
"What do you think it is?"
"It is a masterpiece."
"Only one way to find out."
"As I told you."
"We have a lot to say to each other."
"Here's what you're going to do."
"Yes, you told me."
"He must be around."
"What are you hoping for?"
"You could call it that."
"Please talk to me."
"No, he's not well."
"Do you want me to tell him?"
"I can't do that to him."
"You're just a child."
"I could have done something."
"You did well to call."
"Where have you been?"
"You know how I know that?"
"How much time do I have left?"
"They were lucky."
"What's going on now?"
"You know how it goes."
"More than you can imagine."
"You still don't understand?"
"I have one for you."
"Do you hear yourself?"
"We'll see how it goes."
"No, I couldn't."
"This is what it means."
"No, I wouldn't."
"It's like riding a bike."
"You have to go to school."
"Do you know what that means?"
"Do you know what that means?"
"I have to be honest with you."
"We'll be there in a minute."
"If there is one."
"I don't know what to answer."
"I barely touched it."
"You started it."
"You started it."
"That's right, you're right."
"No, I'm not married."
"I won't answer that."
"We have something in common."
"I'm leaving here."
"A whiskey, please."
"I never asked for anything."
"You have to go home."
"Can we go home?"
"No rest for the brave."
"He is a businessman."
"Yes, there is one."
"You don't know anything about me."
"I knew you would be here."
"What am I making?"
"Have you spoken to your mother?"
"Can I be honest with you?"
"You didn't tell him anything?"
"Do you want to tell me something?"
"I'm going to ask you some questions."
"How do you want me to do it?"
"What are you preparing?"
"It is the will of the gods."
"Thank you all for coming."
"I would like to ask you a question."
"I would like to ask you a question."
"It's just water."
"I'm going to tell you a secret."
"Get that through your head."
"It can only be that."
"It's just for one night."
"I know it is."
"You're the one who left."
"I'll bring you some water."
"Yes, I remember her."
"I was wondering the same thing."
"It's just a legend."
"I have some errands to run."
"Take whatever you want."
"That's the rule of the game."
"I think she's right."
"I had to see you."
"You don't need it anymore."
"Do you think he's here?"
"Maybe he knows something."
"I think I'm in love."
"Aren't we all?"
"She needs a doctor."
"Can you do me a favor?"
"Glad you could come."
"You did well to come."
"That's what it is."
"That's what it is."
"This way, please."
"He's a good little guy."
"There is a curfew."
"I just wanted to say thank you."
"Everything went as planned."
"I'm always here for you."
"You know more than I do."
"Let's see what I can do."
"I have friends there."
"No one will ever know."
"It makes me want to throw up."
"Do you know what you are doing?"
"We'd better go."
"I told you to leave."
"I told you to leave."
"I live only for this."
"Do you know what we call that?"
"She is not a woman."
"What do you mean you can't?"
"What are you doing in my room?"
"What are you doing in my room?"
"I always believed in you."
"I think that's true."
"May the Force be with you."
"Do you want to see something cool?"
"I knew I was right."
"Calm down, please."
"I want to show you something."
"I don't mean that."
"That's what they believe."
"Where do you think you're going like this?"
"Of course I remember."
"Where does this lead?"
"We have work to do."
"I'll be back in half an hour."
"Please wake up."
"I always told you."
"Give him some time."
"Yes, she told me."
"I take that as a compliment."
"He's a good-for-nothing."
"I have to go back to the hospital."
"Is he a friend of yours?"
"I will take care of her."
"Maybe yes, maybe no."
"We agreed."
"Of course I love him."
"Tell him what you want."
"Did you figure this out on your own?"
"Did you come up with this on your own?"
"She told me about you."
"You didn't say that."
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"I saw him once."
"That's why I came."
"I never loved her."
"When do we eat?"
"I am very happy for you."
"There are people here."
"Yeah, I've heard about it."
"I could have told you."
"I could have told you."
"You are part of the family."
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"They weren't."
"You need to go to the hospital."
"What am I missing?"
"What am I missing?"
"It's my father's."
"It's nice of you to come."
"I had a great time."
"Sorry about earlier."
"She knew what she was doing."
"It's you he wants."
"That's what she is."
"Do you have something in mind?"
"Think about what you are doing."
"Think about what you are doing."
"Because I wanted to."
"Can I take your picture?"
"Can I take your picture?"
"I know you would."
"The rules are the rules."
"But everything will be fine."
"Just in case."
"I have my say."
"I will be there as soon as possible."
"No, it's not you."
"I've never heard of that."
"I think I'm going to throw up."
"I've already told you everything."
"I did it this morning."
"I knew it, I knew it."
"I just wanted to say hello."
"They do what they want."
"She never was."
"I thought it was over."
"I'm going to do you a favor."
"What did you call me?"
"Why are you telling me this?"
"Do you know what I am?"
"That's what I'm asking."
"Would you like something to drink?"
"This is the first time."
"Did you have a good night?"
"It's a family thing."
"What's your real name?"
"Is that what you think?"
"Is that what you think?"
"What do we win?"
"I only have you."
"We're going home."
"I've never done any."
"I'm not sure yet."
"I need a few minutes."
"I told them the truth."
"It's time to play."
"Can I get you something?"
"Where did you spend the night?"
"What's behind it?"
"You know what I do?"
"I was going to say the same thing."
"I think you should leave."
"A tea, please."
"It was a car accident."
"What is it then?"
"What happened here?"
"You don't know anything at all."
"How are things at school?"
"I feel like I'm dreaming."
"What are you?"
"You said you loved me."
"I have a job interview."
"I knew this day would come."
"I believe it is possible."
"I will do what I want."
"That's what matters, right?"
"I want to be there for you."
"Exactly what I said."
"It's on every channel."
"Does this suit you?"
"This is what we expected."
"Watch where you put your feet."
"You didn't see me."
"I never had it."
"Where are you?"
"Maybe he's telling the truth."
"It's true, I swear."
"I don't think so either."
"I'm lucky."
"Did he tell you about me?"
"Your face looks familiar."
"What happened to the others?"
"You are one of us."
"It's good to see you again."
"You must have heard about it."
"I've never seen you."
"I hope I'm not disturbing you."
"What are we going to do now?"
"I got him on the phone."
"I want to stay here with you."
"I want to play a game."
"Don't take your eyes off her."
"You don't remember anything?"
"I see through your game."
"No, I can't do that."
"She hasn't come home yet."
"What's happening to him?"
"You have my word of honor."
"That must mean something."
"This is good stuff."
"But I have good news."
"Could you do me a favor?"
"Could you do me a favor?"
"You have nothing else?"
"Don't you have anything else?"
"Is this really a good idea?"
"I have no parents."
"I'll tell you what to do."
"Who could have done this?"
"I'll write you a check."
"No, that's not it."
"Tell me what you think."
"Where are you right now?"
"I'm going to take a shower."
"You say that every time."
"I was thinking the same thing."
"If you don't mind."
"If you don't mind."
"You know what pisses me off?"
"I would like to ask you something."
"I was hoping you would say that."
"It's just a detail."
"Show what you can do."
"You never talked about it."
"She's a friend of mine."
"Is it about money?"
"This is where I work."
"No, I don't like it."
"I'll refresh your memory."
"I have a much better idea."
"What did he mean?"
"But it didn't happen."
"I am speaking."
"She's the cleaning lady."
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"Did anyone see anything?"
"We have things to do."
"You should be in the hospital."
"I need you now."
"I didn't ask for this."
"I'll stay a little longer."
"What I just said."
"What color are my eyes?"
"You can still change your mind."
"Not from my point of view."
"You should have seen your face."
"What is your last name?"
"I love someone else."
"That's what it seemed to me."
"It was worth the wait."
"I have to ask you some questions."
"I saw it first."
"I saw it first."
"I sent him home."
"This is probably a good idea."
"Do you think you're better than me?"
"We have to go to the hospital."
"I had a good teacher."
"I had a good teacher."
"Let me explain something to you."
"I thought we were friends."
"I do what is right."
"Come, I'll show you around."
"How was your day?"
"I only have a few minutes."
"I need someone."
"You know what you're saying?"
"I've seen that look before."
"Where did you find all this?"
"What do you want us to do?"
"You said it."
"I am the one who is."
"Who came up with the idea?"
"She never spoke about it."
"How are we going to get out of this?"
"I need something."
"About a year ago."
"That's all for now."
"That's totally you."
"Maybe or maybe not."
"Look at the state you are in."
"It's you they want."
"I'll get you out of here."
"More than you think."
"I'm really lucky."
"It's a very pretty name."
"I touched a nerve."
"We can't hide anything from you."
"We can't hide anything from you."
"I have a letter for you."
"But there is something."
"And what is it about?"
"I'm done with him."
"That's love."
"I'd better go."
"About a month ago."
"You're lucky."
"You're lucky."
"It will take a little time."
"What else did you see?"
"Is this where you live?"
"Is this where you live?"
"No, I cannot accept."
"How can you tell me that?"
"She must be somewhere."
"Do you have any brothers or sisters?"
"We did a good job."
"I want it to be perfect."
"What's here?"
"What are we drinking?"
"No, it can't wait."
"It only happened once."
"You have to move on."
"It's good to hear from you."
"What do you think about all this?"
"Do you realize what you're saying?"
"I'm glad to hear it."
"Haven't you had enough?"
"I experienced the same thing."
"Do you like it?"
"I'm putting out a search notice."
"See what you can find."
"It'll be better in a minute."
"I was very lucky."
"We were just having fun."
"It all depends on the point of view."
"You have to take care of yourself."
"But why did you do that?"
"May I approach the witness?"
"She reminds me of you."
"I was looking forward to meeting you."
"I need a driver."
"There's only you."
"There are children here."
"I thought I'd find you here."
"It has always been this way."
"Do you know how much I love you?"
"I'm so happy for you."
"Tell him how you feel."
"Can I give you some advice?"
"What will it change?"
"I want to tell you something."
"I want to tell you something."
"It's at the end of the corridor."
"I have to say it."
"Are you there?"
"What if we get caught?"
"I am very grateful to you."
"I wanted to show you something."
"I'll get you something to drink."
"I want you to come with me."
"We'll be here for a while."
"I inquired about you."
"I wonder where she is."
"I have news for you."
"You should have told me about it."
"You should have told me about it."
"Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen."
"He never had one."
"What are you doing in my house?"
"It's up to her to decide."
"Who do you think you are?"
"This is what we are."
"Do what I ask."
"I think it's there."
"It's two o'clock in the morning."
"She has no one else."
"You can't go anywhere."
"Let's see what's there."
"What does he like?"
"I thought you might like it."
"He asked me to come."
"I didn't tell them."
"You are absolutely right."
"Please listen to me."
"And then there's this."
"I owe him money."
"We'll do that another time."
"Here's what happened."
"What about me?"
"I'm glad to be here."
"What is it?"
"Do you know what it's called?"
"I'm taking him to the hospital."
"I don't drink beer."
"You don't know anything about her."
"What do you know about this?"
"I'll be a few minutes."
"I need water."
"It's time to wake up."
"Who gave you the order?"
"Everyone has secrets."
"You are on private property."
"How long did it last?"
"Are you a friend of his?"
"No, I'm not angry."
"Do you have anything to eat?"
"I never said it."
"What are you going to do with that?"
"Did she tell you about me?"
"I love you both."
"I know what he's thinking."
"What will happen to them?"
"Sorry to have scared you."
"Do you know who you are talking to?"
"We'll take you home."
"That's what we believe."
"No, I didn't hear anything."
"No, I don't know her."
"Is that you doing this?"
"What's happening to her?"
"What is he accused of?"
"You should rest a little."
"I didn't say yes."
"I need a phone."
"What do you smell?"
"Tell him I'm fine."
"I knew it was him."
"Because I care about you."
"I'll call you a taxi."
"I know how I feel."
"They are not soldiers."
"I'll take you home."
"Maybe it's a trick."
"I didn't know her."
"I know what you are looking for."
"There is a big difference."
"What else can I say?"
"I have never met them."
"Everything is changing."
"Didn't you hear me?"
"Of course I have it."
"Tell him I love him."
"Whether you like it or not."
"Whether you like it or not."
"What do you want to talk to me about?"
"I don't know anything about him."
"Will it work?"
"It's up to him to decide."
"But he's not there anymore."
"My feet are like jelly."
"I'm just saying."
"Would you like to join me?"
"Have you heard from him?"
"How did it happen?"
"They could be anywhere."
"I knew you would do that."
"I'm coming to say goodbye to you."
"I'll give you my card."
"How long did I sleep?"
"What if they don't come?"
"You shouldn't either."
"You have what you want."
"Do you remember this place?"
"There is something in it."
"I want to make this clear."
"Do you see what's happening?"
"I think you were right."
"I didn't even think about it."
"It's up to us to play."
"It's been over a week."
"This is my point of view."
"It was just a game."
"Do you have somewhere to go?"
"Do you know what he's talking about?"
"If you're lucky."
"They started it."
"What is she?"
"He did a good job."
"I need to calm down."
"I found it like this."
"No, no, I can't."
"I am eating."
"I need your support."
"You have to earn a living."
"I think I'll stay."
"I want it to be you."
"There must be one."
"I thought it was obvious."
"That wasn't the question."
"I sent her home."
"Nice to meet you."
"Thank you for taking the time."
"We are on the right track."
"Have you heard of him?"
"Have you heard of him?"
"It happened like this."
"I think it's time."
"I have never been married."
"I am one of them."
"I can't swallow anything anymore."
"Can we talk about this later?"
"It was nice to see you again."
"And I'll tell you why."
"What exactly is it?"
"It should have been said earlier."
"Do I know?"
"You will get what you want."
"You will have what you want."
"Better not to know."
"They are more numerous than us."
"You are on the right track."
"It was nice meeting you."
"I have something better."
"I want to talk to my daughter."
"It's a workplace."
"Is this normal?"
"Maybe it's time."
"I want what you want."
"It can only be him."
"I just need rest."
"It was good to see you again."
"I am very proud of you."
"They have the right to know."
"Anything I should know?"
"Why are you telling me all this?"
"I spoke to him on the phone."
"I felt the same way."
"You know what I would like?"
"You know what I would like?"
"He's the one you want."
"There must be someone."
"So be it."
"Do you want me to open it?"
"Please call me back."
"Maybe it's not him."
"No, I don't remember."
"No, I don't remember."
"Like I told you."
"This was just the beginning."
"I am the Hand of the King."
"There is always a chance."
"I told you yesterday."
"She is not herself."
"He knows what I'm talking about."
"I have some very good news."
"They are not mine."
"No time to explain."
"And what did you tell him?"
"And you, what do you think?"
"We did our best."
"I'll get you one."
"But I need time."
"It's just for fun."
"I'm ready to do it."
"There is plenty of room."
"I can't think."
"No, that's not why."
"She's the one I want."
"Let me refresh your memory."
"She didn't do that."
"You don't have to answer."
"Do you know what they do?"
"I know I can."
"Whose idea was this?"
"Of course, I remember."
"We might have something."
"She didn't talk about it."
"Were you asked for your opinion?"
"I'll bring you some water."
"She's always been like this."
"We're taking you to the hospital."
"Thanks for reminding me."
"We have a job to do."
"Don't lecture me."
"What are you doing in the dark?"
"I'm proud of you, son."
"I don't play that game."
"I made you a promise."
"I have a message for him."
"Look what you've become."
"I need to hear it."
"I asked her to marry me."
"You have to tell me the truth."
"I understand your point of view."
"I understand your point of view."
"I really have to go."
"We'll talk about that later."
"That's what he believed."
"What is she wearing?"
"Did you spend the night here?"
"I know you're busy."
"Let's see how it goes."
"We have some things to sort out."
"It's time for you to go."
"We can still turn around."
"You better be careful."
"You can spend the night here."
"How do you plan to do this?"
"They know I'm here."
"I know a little about it."
"Are you leaving like that?"
"So what did he say?"
"What does it represent?"
"Do you remember when we met?"
"It's up to you to tell us."
"I'll be here when you come back."
"When the hens have teeth."
"What should I do?"
"It's a war zone."
"The sooner the better."
"What was she doing?"
"There never will be."
"I hope you like it."
"I just heard the news."
"I want to say goodbye to him."
"He said he would come."
"I'll be two seconds."
"It is a work of art."
"It is a work of art."
"What's missing?"
"That's all to your credit."
"I thought the same thing."
"What amuses you?"
"I cut my finger."
"Would you like a cup of coffee?"
"That's why you're here."
"It is against the law."
"No, we don't have any."
"Do you know who I'm talking about?"
"I'm taking her home."
"That's what's important."
"It's far from over."
"I need your opinion."
"This is what I have."
"How much time does he have left?"
"Isn't that the case?"
"I have to be honest with you."
"What kind of man is he?"
"You never said anything."
"I need to concentrate."
"I need a volunteer."
"I think it will work."
"You know what I would do?"
"What would you say?"
"How was your night?"
"Maybe it's fate."
"It has to be you."
"I didn't call him."
"What else is there?"
"Two for the price of one."
"I want us to get married."
"I am a man of God."
"My mother told me."
"Do you remember anything?"
"Do you think that's true?"
"What do we look like?"
"Okay, I'm done."
"Eat while it's hot."
"I had never felt like this."
"Of course I'm here."
"I forgot to tell you."
"What happened happened."
"That's what I wish."
"I never thought that."
"We have to go."
"You did well."
"Well, it is."
"Do you understand me?"
"I want to ask you a question."
"I think I found something."
"I want to hear you say it."
"Can we see each other later?"
"You don't trust me?"
"He reminds me of you."
"What is he looking at?"
"Because he's my brother."
"I'll be home soon."
"I can't even imagine."
"What are you doing here so late?"
"You just have to ask."
"Is that what you do?"
"I want to give you something."
"Do you see it?"
"May his soul rest in peace."
"He suspects something."
"I know you're hungry."
"I want to ask you something."
"I know you're here."
"I'll look for some more."
"I have more important things to do."
"I wanted to know how you were doing."
"You are not up to it."
"It's for your own good."
"There is a third option."
"I think we're done."
"I need to speak to you in private."
"Who told you about this?"
"This is an ongoing investigation."
"Maybe you're right."
"It's time for medication."
"Please forgive me."
"Please forgive me."
"I see it every day."
"I've been there before."
"It's a rescue mission."
"That's the difference between us."
"Do you know about this?"
"My legs are like cotton."
"Do you know who said that?"
"She's not yours."
"I'm really happy for you."
"She can't hear you."
"Two beers, please."
"I'll go there myself."
"No, you don't know him."
"What am I being accused of?"
"I like that in a woman."
"It's a wedding gift."
"It's a rite of passage."
"It's a phone number."
"I want you to have this."
"No, I don't want to."
"Will it last long?"
"Tell me what happened."
"Are you aware of this?"
"I just wanted to make sure."
"She's not a girl."
"I'll make things easier for you."
"I pronounce you husband and wife."
"You must leave right away."
"Tell me what you're thinking."
"No need to thank me."
"I want to know where he is."
"And this is for you."
"I think it is necessary."
"It took me a while."
"We'll take care of her."
"I will be as silent as a grave."
"I left you three messages."
"We do this all the time."
"What else did he say?"
"She never did."
"I slept with someone."
"Do you want me to come with you?"
"It's like you said."
"Thank you for coming."
"I love you too, my darling."
"How could I have known?"
"Of course you know that."
"I think I'll go home."
"Leave him out of it."
"I had something to do."
"Honey, what's going on?"
"You should have told me."
"What are you running from?"
"I didn't wake up."
"What's behind it?"
"Can I have some?"
"They didn't say it."
"What's on it?"
"You didn't listen to me?"
"You can still change your mind."
"You are one of them."
"Let's see what you can do."
"How did you get on?"
"I just arrived in town."
"What about you?"
"What about you?"
"Do you understand what's going on?"
"I must be able to do something."
"I have some work for you."
"You know what's coming."
"It's better for both of us."
"We are so proud of you."
"This is just a guess."
"I have one for you."
"I'm taking you to the hospital."
"It's exactly the same thing."
"This better be good."
"I wanted to tell you something."
"But it's worth it."
"You need to listen to me."
"We will take care of you."
"We will take care of you."
"Guess what I found."
"This is a gift for you."
"At the point I'm at."
"Can I offer you some tea?"
"What's holding him back?"
"It's an engagement ring."
"What did you say?"
"I already told you no."
"Everyone is talking about you."
"I'm taking him home."
"You should have come to see me."
"We have a big day tomorrow."
"I saw her first."
"I saw her first."
"Have you spoken to your father?"
"I thought you would be happy."
"There must be something."
"Don't pay attention to them."
"Please let it pass."
"And what happens?"
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
"Do you want something to drink?"
"I know what to expect."
"I had a lot of work."
"Can I sit with you?"
"You know what you want."
"We need to talk to you."
"That's where he is."
"What do you mean, you don't know?"
"And what did he answer?"
"That was nice of you."
"Someone is in a good mood."
"Do you know what I am?"
"You read my mind."
"This is where I live."
"We'll talk about it at home."
"I have to go see someone."
"What are we going to do with it?"
"You have no proof."
"Call me as soon as you can."
"I have to get out of here."
"I have to get out of here."
"It's a guy thing."
"Did you want to tell me something?"
"Do you have anything to add?"
"Where is she right now?"
"It's just a movie."
"I had never heard that."
"He does what he can."
"Is it me?"
"He is absolutely right."
"It's about us."
"I have a big day tomorrow."
"You did it for yourself."
"No, I don't believe you."
"Look after each other."
"Everyone tells me that."
"We have something for you."
"There were a lot of people."
"I will never do it again."
"That's what we think."
"I'll show you how to do it."
"What's left?"
"The police, please."
"No, you don't know that."
"And that doesn't bother you?"
"I only have one question."
"I think we're done."
"She didn't mean that."
"It started to rain."
"When is he coming back?"
"What happened?"
"No one has ever seen him."
"You have your whole life ahead of you."
"Let's see what's going on."
"I never had it."
"Have you ever been told this?"
"You are a very beautiful woman."
"Thank you for telling me about it."
"I have a few questions for you."
"Can you do this for me?"
"He did well."
"I don't know the answer."
"This is completely understandable."
"I relieve you of your duties."
"I don't have a sister."
"He's just a kid."
"What would you do in my place?"
"I have something else in mind."
"He knows what he wants."
"You're right on time."
"How are you so sure?"
"I'm going to brush my teeth."
"If only it were that simple."
"Okay, see you later."
"Do you think it's good?"
"You don't need to know."
"I want you to see it."
"I bit my tongue."
"Come on, I'll show you around."
"If we're lucky."
"I hadn't seen her."
"I can tell you one thing."
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"No, I don't need it."
"I hope they are well."
"It was God's will."
"Do you have a statement to make?"
"I know he is."
"Your mother told me."
"What is he wearing?"
"I'm glad to hear from you."
"Do what he tells you."
"Do you know what this means?"
"She's not with you?"
"I guess that's it."
"I got shot."
"Let me tell you something."
"Is that what you're saying?"
"Have you ever tried our sausages?"
"Please, talk to me."
"Anywhere, anytime."
"Can I tell you a secret?"
"Can I tell you a secret?"
"And I love you for that."
"I want to talk to my brother."
"Isn't that right, guys?"
"Love one another."
"Yes, there is something."
"Nobody cared."
"I'll buy you a drink."
"We made the right choice."
"That's what scares me."
"It's a madhouse."
"Maybe I'll go."
"Please forgive me."
"It's for everyone."
"We'll clear this up."
"I slept on the couch."
"I saw you with him."
"I will never let you go."
"You wouldn't have a cigarette?"
"I want you to do it."
"What does all this mean?"
"He needs his mother."
"No, I don't have time."
"What if I can't do it?"
"It's a gift from heaven."
"There is always one."
"I wrote you a song."
"You only think about yourself."
"What's your name again?"
"Where have you been all day?"
"I have a proposition for you."
"Did you see who's here?"
"Okay, let's go."
"Do you see what it is?"
"What will we do?"
"I have to go to church."
"I'm glad to be here."
"I don't have time right now."
"I thought you knew that."
"I'll make you something."
"I thought everything was fine."
"I should never have come."
"I thought I told you."
"What are you going to do with this?"
"Would you like to do me a favor?"
"I have to move on."
"I grew up in this house."
"Do you have anything else to say?"
"I'm here to protect you."
"I'm out of bullets."
"You don't know anything about him."
"I want him to be happy."
"I'll explain everything to you later."
"Give it your all."
"I can't read this."
"I knew I would find you."
"I understand what you are saying."
"I don't have a plan."
"You weren't even there."
"We're here to have fun."
"The Dutchman must have a captain."
"I am stronger than you."
"What, you don't believe me?"
"Did he do something to you?"
"It helps me focus."
"Maybe I am."
"Can I tell you something?"
"Can I tell you something?"
"I am one of your admirers."
"I thought you left."
"I thought you left."
"Do you know why you're here?"
"I always have it with me."
"I told you to get out."
"I told you to get out of here."
"No, she didn't say anything."
"I'll let you rest."
"It's up to you."
"It's up to you to tell us."
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
"Did you have a good time?"
"Did you have a good time?"
"You know what would be good?"
"Can I see you for a moment?"
"I know exactly where he is."
"What motivates you?"
"I wish you a pleasant stay."
"No, you don't."
"I thought I heard voices."
"It will be for next time."
"Please follow us."
"I know what they're doing."
"You used me."
"You're the one I was looking for."
"No, I didn't."
"I need a bath."
"When are you leaving?"
"I've heard that before."
"It's been over a year."
"There is always a reason."
"That's where I was."
"What is it then?"
"Glad you liked it."
"I found another one."
"You need to know this."
"I'll get another one."
"I think it's here."
"Of course I believe you."
"That's what you were saying."
"What if you can't?"
"You were right."
"This is what will happen."
"Can't you do better?"
"She didn't know."
"He did his best."
"I need a hug."
"It is a masterpiece."
"Maybe you'll change your mind."
"I will give you an example."
"You want me to be honest?"
"You know me better than that."
"I just did it."
"There's a price on your head."
"Of course it is possible."
"I have a family to support."
"They did something to him."
"I feel good with you."
"Ask someone else."
"It's a Christmas miracle."
"And my brother lives with them."
"He is on a business trip."
"Are you ready to go?"
"Don't ask me questions."
"Don't ask me any questions."
"I know it was you."
"But I have another idea."
"Don't go away from me."
"Look what I have here."
"I would like to talk to you for a moment."
"I hope you find it."
"You're going to need this."
"I'm proud of you, son."
"I know how to take care of myself."
"I'll get you something to drink."
"She does this all the time."
"I spoke to him last night."
"It's just a story."
"Have you ever been told?"
"No time to explain."
"If there is one."
"Are you listening to what I'm saying?"
"I left you a message."
"I know what he's doing."
"What is he writing?"
"It's good to hear that."
"Glad you could come."
"We can see it like this."
"You can see it like this."
"What if we can't?"
"I did well to come."
"I prepared something for you."
"Only time will tell."
"You can join us."
"I have always been with you."
"I can't think anymore."
"What does he believe?"
"There will be an investigation."
"Do you know what it's for?"
"Finish what you started."
"No, we are not."
"You would have done the same thing."
"I'm going to get myself a beer."
"I want to talk to my husband."
"I only have a minute."
"I don't have to answer."
"It's our wedding anniversary."
"Anyone else know?"
"You should have seen your face."
"What happens then?"
"Of course I forgive you."
"No need to apologize."
"Thank you all for being here."
"It's just dinner."
"I want you to forgive me."
"Was that a gunshot?"
"I knew you'd like it."
"Is it better?"
"You don't want to do it?"
"Do you think it's him?"
"Tell me what you have."
"Do you know what I have?"
"Thank you for doing this for me."
"It's just a dog."
"What would you like?"
"I want to talk to my son."
"And how did it go?"
"I brought you something to eat."
"I'll give you a hint."
"He's one of them."
"We've known each other for years."
"No, it isn't."
"Can I take a look at it?"
"You just have to trust me."
"Can we talk?"
"You did the right thing."
"I'm not a kid."
"She did her best."
"Do you hear what I'm saying?"
"I'm the one doing it."
"I spoke to your father."
"I want to know everything about him."
"And what am I supposed to do?"
"She never loved me."
"I'll settle the score with him."
"She can't be far away."
"Is it good?"
"Can I talk to you for a moment?"
"No, that's a good idea."
"I read it in your eyes."
"You have to do better than that."
"It was supposed to be a surprise."
"Everything looks in order."
"I have to find him."
"Do you know what I think?"
"She seems very nice."
"I am a businesswoman."
"I'm ready to go."
"I have to tell him."
"What do you hear?"
"I would like to tell you something."
"What's plan B?"
"We've seen others."
"This is your moment to shine."
"What do I win?"
"From one day to the next."
"I have so much to tell you."
"I am not a boy."
"This might be a clue."
"This is the password."
"You need to talk to me."
"You think I don't know?"
"I'd like to show you something."
"Did he say anything else?"
"I answered your question."
"Do you want to do me a favor?"
"Please don't leave."
"No, I'll take care of it."
"I thought it was you."
"I thought it was you."
"You opened my eyes."
"What do I know?"
"I was raised like that."
"Where did you study?"
"Give me some time."
"Give me some time."
"Let me tell you a story."
"I have a mission to accomplish."
"There is something."
"What else can we do?"
"I've had it for years."
"Do I need a lawyer?"
"I think she's right."
"You can't say that."
"What did she do to you?"
"I think it worked."
"That's absolutely right."
"You were very lucky."
"I thought you loved him."
"You know what they say."
"How long will you be here?"
"Tell me what you think."
"What am I writing?"
"I'm just a woman."
"I already told you about it."
"Is this what you were looking for?"
"It's cool to see you."
"You have to get me out of here."
"I had a good life."
"Fuck her."
"How did we get here?"
"I should have thought of that before."
"I'll be here when you wake up."
"Do you want to go to the hospital?"
"What is better?"
"You can be proud of yourself."
"It won't."
"I tried to protect you."
"I have nothing against him."
"He's lucky."
"Yes, I remember him."
"She looks in good shape."
"I'll take care of that one."
"There's one there."
"Your mother would be proud of you."
"I never touched her."
"You need a doctor."
"I need to rest."
"That's all to your credit."
"I'll make you some tea."
"He did it himself."
"Tell me a little about yourself."
"Maybe that's a good sign."
"Have you started drinking again?"
"How can you be sure?"
"They look so happy."
"He sent me."
"It was my grandmother's."
"May the Lord be with you."
"I hope that's clear."
"What does it feel like?"
"She's one of us."
"Do you think I enjoy this?"
"You didn't even look."
"We've known each other for a while."
"I will never have children."
"I know how she feels."
"I took something from you."
"It's a little further."
"Everyone wants something."
"Thank you for seeing me so quickly."
"It's nice of you to come."
"What's over there?"
"I always wanted a daughter."
"You need to wake up."
"He is one of us."
"I love what you do."
"You were just a child."
"I think I'll leave."
"What are you doing?"
"I never want to see you again."
"I can do it by myself."
"I am very happy for you."
"But he wasn't."
"Let's take a closer look."
"I want you to see this."
"His face looks familiar."
"But what is it about?"
"It's easier that way."
"What if you came with me?"
"Look what we found."
"Look what we found."
"There is a price on my head."
"It's my mother's."
"Give her what she wants."
"It wasn't a suggestion."
"I knew you were there."
"Do you know where she went?"
"Where have I heard that before?"
"I knew you would find me."
"What are you writing?"
"Tell us what you want."
"Can we ask you some questions?"
"It's rare, but it happens."
"What exactly did she say?"
"I've got the hang of it."
"Maybe that's it."
"Do you have something to say?"
"Nobody wants you here."
"The number, please."
"What are we going to do with him?"
"You're out of luck."
"You can't hide."
"Oh, it's a long story."
"How are we going to get out of here?"
"Have you ever kissed a girl?"
"I'm here, I'm staying."
"I have a job to do."
"I say this for your own good."
"No, but I will."
"I don't know, we'll see."
"You knew it from the start."
"Do you think you're better than me?"
"Everyone has a choice."
"But I don't."
"He gets what he deserves."
"I need to do it."
"Is that all?"
"It's just an impression."
"He is as gentle as a lamb."
"What's his name again?"
"I had never heard of it."
"They are not mine."
"I saw him in a dream."
"Let's take a look."
"I know she's here."
"I didn't invite him."
"I have little time left."
"You should go home."
"You just have to ask him."
"I saw this on the news."
"I take a look."
"And you, what are you going to do?"
"No, it wasn't him."
"Who gave the order?"
"Please hurry up."
"Please hurry."
"I want you to marry me."
"I had the right to know."
"This better be good."
"I hope you are happy."
"I know you will."
"How could I do this?"
"Because I saw it."
"I know what he looks like."
"I'm surprised to see you."
"As if you didn't know."
"We do it all the time."
"It's a courtesy visit."
"Where did you get all this from?"
"I told you no."
"That's what we thought."
"I have them."
"I'm glad you called."
"I need to talk to you."
"What are you doing here?"
"Do you really want to do this now?"
"It's a witch hunt."
"That's the point of the game."
"Do you still need me?"
"Did you do something to him?"
"I needed to hear that."
"What you just said."
"I have a reputation to uphold."
"You don't think I can do it?"
"Go home and rest."
"What do you think I'm doing?"
"So what happened?"
"When did this happen?"
"I don't have that impression."
"I have to go to a meeting."
"It's black magic."
"It's always the same with you."
"We have something in common."
"She needs to rest."
"I have someone to see."
"Do you know what you have?"
"I thought you loved me."
"Do you know what he says?"
"Nothing is known about him."
"I believe this belongs to you."
"You'll have to trust me."
"I have no desire to do so."
"What kind of work do you do?"
"I did the same thing."
"It's time for that to change."
"The countdown has begun."
"She shouldn't be here."
"Take back what you said."
"Can I have another one?"
"The facts speak for themselves."
"But you have to trust me."
"The keys are in the ignition."
"Sorry it was so long."
"What did you want to talk to me about?"
"Were you expecting someone else?"
"I am so happy for you."
"I should have come earlier."
"This was not the case."
"Why did you bring him here?"
"You must leave immediately."
"See you at the party."
"She didn't tell you?"
"I'll take you home."
"There is no hope."
"I still have a lot to learn."
"Do you know what time it is?"
"No, I'll take a taxi."
"How did I get out of it?"
"This is very good work."
"You can leave whenever you want."
"I wanted to say goodbye to him."
"No point in talking about it."
"Let me explain something to you."
"That's what I like to hear."
"I think he's fine."
"You're right, you're right."
"What do you know about this?"
"Maybe not so much."
"You already asked me."
"I brought you a gift."
"Do you know what that means?"
"Of course it's him."
"You need to get up."
"What is this thing?"
"What have you gotten yourself into?"
"Do you want to know who I am?"
"Can you do this for me?"
"I understood the first time."
"He just told me."
"Enjoy it while it lasts."
"I'll meet you at the car."
"I'm sure you understand."
"You didn't find it?"
"I think it's going to rain."
"He only thinks about that."
"I didn't ask for it."
"Tell him I'll call him back."
"But that's a good thing."
"I see this all the time."
"There is so much to say."
"Could you lower your voice?"
"I wanted to apologize for yesterday."
"I love you, that's all."
"I just knew it."
"It's Christmas Eve."
"Do you want to go see a movie?"
"What are we doing?"
"Yes, there is one."
"Yes, there is one."
"This is the will of Allah."
"Come on, see you later."
"We'll take care of them."
"You hit the nail on the head."
"I shook his hand."
"You're out of luck."
"You did a great job."
"And I'm proud of you."
"Do you want to enter this program?"
"I had a wonderful dream."
"You don't know who it is?"
"One room, please."
"I'll give you a chance."
"Let's see what you have."
"I appreciate what you do."
"I have something planned."
"I know I love you."
"No, I haven't seen her."
"What were you looking at?"
"Leave while you can."
"What do we bet?"
"You didn't talk to him?"
"I think I love you."
"What are you saying?"
"I want to talk to my mother."
"I want you to keep it."
"When do I go out?"
"How did I get here?"
"How did I get here?"
"You could have told me."
"You should go to the hospital."
"You should go to the hospital."
"I can do that for you."
"Take your torches and return to camp."
"I am one of your fans."
"I'll have a word with him."
"I made him a promise."
"This is my reason for being."
"He's somewhere around there."
"What about the others?"
"This is my birthday present."
"I think I know who it is."
"I know what you like."
"How long do you plan to stay?"
"You are really lucky."
"I've done it before."
"What interests you?"
"What tempts you?"
"It's just money."
"It's a lifestyle."
"I know what she wants."
"They told him about a light."
"You look very beautiful tonight."
"No, I don't care."
"Compliments of the house."
"I give you five out of five."
"A time machine."
"Can you tell me more?"
"Can you tell me more?"
"I'd rather not talk about it."
"I drove all night."
"We did well."
"That's what he thinks."
"You better be right."
"What worked?"
"You don't have to."
"I wish you a good evening."
"There must be an exit."
"If it makes you happy."
"I think it's her."
"I think you're right."
"What's going on here?"
"I understand what's going on."
"He's my bodyguard."
"I just found out."
"It's going to be okay, I'm here."
"I need both of you."
"Do you want me to take it?"
"Everyone can see it."
"This is friendly advice."
"I knew he would."
"That's what we were saying."
"I'll let you in on a secret."
"Can I drop you off somewhere?"
"I want to get this over with."
"Let me do this for you."
"It's breathtaking."
"Would you like to come with me?"
"I have some information for you."
"Okay, I've got you."
"We have to find her."
"When will the ships be ready?"
"I'd better go."
"It's time to pay."
"Is this what you want?"
"That's what he's looking for."
"You have to move on."
"Do you know why we're here?"
"I made the right decision."
"Can I call you later?"
"Can't you say it?"
"And you, what is your name?"
"He says so."
"It was worth a try."
"That's right, you're right."
"I'll buy you another one."
"I'll buy you another one."
"I wrote it for you."
"I want you to have it."
"What is it?"
"But you weren't there."
"We have unfinished business."
"Who told you about me?"
"Oh, that's a good idea."
"I made friends."
"I'll give you one."
"You didn't tell them?"
"It opened my eyes."
"I need your advice."
"It had to happen sooner or later."
"Do you have anything to drink?"
"Do you have anything to drink?"
"I need to talk to you."
"I'm going to teach you a lesson."
"When are we going home?"
"Captain, what's going on?"
"We have to stay together."
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"What do you have to gain?"
"He says he loves me."
"Can I show you something?"
"Thank you for believing in me."
"What's going on, Dad?"
"You're right on time."
"I'm going to go get some fresh air."
"We can't go anywhere."
"No one has ever done it."
"Whose house is this?"
"This is what is happening."
"I told you to come home."
"How's it going in there?"
"No, no, no, it's fine."
"What can I do for you, sir?"
"I thought it was settled."
"Please believe me."
"Please believe me."
"I need to see her."
"Take a look."
"Do you think this is true?"
"Who gave you this number?"
"We will take care of him."
"I bought it for you."
"I bought it for you."
"They knew what they were doing."
"Out of sight, out of mind."
"I just wanted to talk to you about that."
"You don't want to say it?"
"I need more men."
"Get out or I'll call the police."
"I wrote you a letter."
"You don't have children?"
"Give us a hand."
"It's rush hour."
"How about we go for a walk?"
"It's good to see you."
"There is always someone."
"You are relieved of your duties."
"I told you yes."
"I'm not leaving without him."
"You never told me about it."
"Look what I have here."
"I don't speak your language."
"Do you know where they went?"
"Have you never thought about it?"
"Do you know what happened?"
"What will I do without you?"
"Am I dreaming?"
"That makes at least one."
"Don't you want to sit down?"
"Do you want to go get a coffee?"
"I've seen it before."
"I've been in your shoes."
"I know you're right."
"And what happened to him?"
"It's good to be here."
"I am pleased to meet you."
"I am pleased to meet you."
"I want to go with you."
"Don't try to fool me."
"You have to enjoy life."
"When were you planning to tell me?"
"What are we playing?"
"Do you want to go with me?"
"I'm really happy for you."
"I think it will work."
"There must be a way."
"I want a cigarette."
"I feel it in my gut."
"You know what I'm saying?"
"That's what she said."
"Please calm down."
"Please calm down."
"You no longer have a choice."
"You no longer have a choice."
"We will do what we can."
"It goes further than that."
"Have I not been clear?"
"Not while I'm here."
"She is in all her states."
"Let's see what happens."
"Explain to me what's going on."
"Why are you telling me all this?"
"Why are you telling me all this?"
"I need to know."
"No, I don't do that."
"I need to know why."
"I know what you were thinking."
"She knows what she's talking about."
"I would like to introduce someone to you."
"Are you from the same family?"
"What do you think about all this?"
"I want to give you something."
"That's totally him."
"I ask you."
"Talk to me, please."
"How did you get here?"
"How did you get here?"
"Of course I'm sure."
"See what you can find."
"I love you, you know that?"
"You can never have enough."
"I just wanted to tell you."
"Did you have a good day?"
"Do you hear what I'm saying?"
"The back door was open."
"I have one too."
"What do you feel?"
"I like your way of thinking."
"Okay, I found it."
"It's a business trip."
"That's good news."
"He was there just now."
"Can't you go any faster?"
"It's all right, it's over."
"It's time for gifts."
"That's what we did."
"It's not up to you."
"I have something else for you."
"What did I do to him?"
"He is a man of his word."
"I know what you're talking about."
"I'll make it easy for you."
"I'm needed here."
"Do as I said."
"You weren't yourself."
"Do you want some company?"
"I do this every day."
"I never knew why."
"Tell them I love them."
"I had an incredible dream."
"The bathroom is there."
"I need to talk to my husband."
"I started it."
"It's a rental car."
"What would I have done without you?"
"Should I draw you a picture?"
"I had that dream again."
"What do you like?"
"Show me your ID card."
"What else can you do?"
"I think I should go home."
"Are you looking for me?"
"No, it's not important."
"I need to talk to my father."
"I think it's important."
"Okay, what's going on?"
"I go there all the time."
"I would have done anything."
"So far, so good."
"It looks delicious to me."
"You haven't read it?"
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"I am working."
"I'll take another one."
"I didn't invite her."
"It's not luck."
"I've always wondered that."
"Do you have some time?"
"Yes, you already said that."
"I'm going to stay here for a while."
"Everyone loves heroes."
"I don't want tea."
"You have to tell him the truth."
"I have friends in high places."
"I will always be there for you."
"What if it doesn't work?"
"I know you're busy."
"I know you're busy."
"Explain to me what's going on."
"Who hasn't?"
"Let me ask you something."
"Do you have someone in mind?"
"I know what they want."
"What do you think it is?"
"What do you think it is?"
"I have what you wanted."
"Who knows what might happen?"
"Who do you think I am?"
"Who do you think I am?"
"That's where we come in."
"You're just like everyone else."
"To what do I owe this pleasure?"
"Didn't they tell you?"
"I keep calling you."
"You know what I have?"
"Yes, it looks good."
"I left the door open."
"Do you understand what that means?"
"Do you understand what that means?"
"Tell him I called."
"What if it's a boy?"
"I'm not a girl."
"You are safe with me."
"Can I go home?"
"It's a secret between us."
"You did well."
"Take a look around you."
"No, he's not here."
"Someone has to do something."
"What if he doesn't come back?"
"What am I forgetting?"
"Maybe it's something else."
"Chance does things well."
"Give them what they want."
"That's really kind of you."
"I told you about her."
"Can you give me some?"
"I'm winning."
"Look what I did."
"Where do you live?"
"Where do you live?"
"I need a moment."
"I know this from a reliable source."
"I told you to wait."
"I told you to wait."
"I'm glad to see you again."
"I was born in space."
"I have some work for you."
"She's not a child anymore."
"Do you want to ask me something?"
"No, I wasn't."
"You better believe it."
"Not long ago."
"Its place is in a museum."
"I went to a good school."
"I have what you want."
"It doesn't hurt to ask."
"Are you sure about this?"
"What kind of person are you?"
"No, not in the least."
"He asked you a question."
"I just got to the hospital."
"You were just a child."
"What is all this stuff?"
"Is there a doctor?"
"And I'll tell you why."
"It's part of life."
"I'll take care of the door."
"Is this what you want?"
"Where do you want me to be?"
"I like what I see."
"Let's go for a drive."
"I've seen this movie before."
"What are you doing in my office?"
"This is the house of God."
"Do you realize what you are saying?"
"It's my way of being."
"Turn around, please."
"I read it somewhere."
"It happened very quickly."
"Tell me how you feel."
"What's your hurry?"
"What else could I do?"
"I knocked on the door."
"What does she know?"
"I did you a favor."
"I have eyes to see."
"It is a gift from God."
"You don't remember?"
"Look what happened."
"She has no friends."
"Just what I needed."
"Don't you see it?"
"I need your phone."
"She's not with you?"
"I have one thing to do."
"You can be whoever you want."
"It's my business."
"It is against the law."
"I come here all the time."
"Is there another way?"
"Everything has to start somewhere."
"I waited all day."
"I need a few days."
"I've been looking into you."
"I see what you're talking about."
"I remember one thing."
"We are the same, you and I."
"All I need."
"Because I need it."
"It's all to his credit."
"It happened to me once."
"You're right, it's true."
"Can I get you anything else?"
"This is how it happened."
"Tell us what you know."
"Did she tell you about me?"
"How much time do we have?"
"She's doing very well."
"You made the right choice."
"So what's your plan?"
"He wants her name."
"Let's take a look."
"No, I'm not ready."
"I am very happy for you."
"I am free as a bird."
"I'm going to put an end to it."
"It never is."
"I should have told you about it."
"I realize it now."
"And you, what are you doing here?"
"I see what you're doing."
"I thought I saw someone."
"Tell him I'm here."
"What's stopping you?"
"I made you a sandwich."
"So, did it go well?"
"I'm not sleeping with him."
"I saw it myself."
"I have patients to see."
"Take all you can."
"I did it for her."
"That's what he wants."
"No, that doesn't make any sense."
"Did you tell him about me?"
"Don't involve her in this."
"I'll give you something."
"I have to go to the bank."
"I only speak the truth."
"Do you want me to come with you?"
"I have to go to work."
"It was nice talking to you."
"I hope you like it."
"You have a very nice house."
"I want to marry you."
"I had something to do."
"I'll be back as soon as possible."
"I need you to come."
"That's what I would say."
"I promise you."
"It was a set-up."
"I've known him for years."
"Go ahead, I'll take care of it."
"He needs a father."
"What did it say?"
"I realize that."
"Please be quiet."
"If you need anything, call me."
"Go see what it is."
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
"In fact, it is."
"I think it's her."
"Guys, guys, guys."
"You have no authority here."
"Let's not jump to conclusions."
"Have you spoken to anyone?"
"Do you have anything to eat?"
"Did it make you feel better?"
"I invited her to dinner."
"What do you have to tell us?"
"Did you tell mom?"
"No, I don't want that."
"What you told me."
"Show me what you're worth."
"That's what I hear."
"You should be proud of him."
"He will take care of you."
"He will take care of you."
"Did you do this for me?"
"You need someone."
"What were they saying?"
"He was inspired by you."
"Do you have any brothers or sisters?"
"No, it didn't work."
"He will be here in an hour."
"You know her better than I do."
"You know her better than I do."
"Of course I have some."
"Move over, please."
"Do you know what she does?"
"I would be very grateful."
"Because he's my friend."
"I called you several times."
"This is a very generous offer."
"I think it's good."
"Don't call him that."
"It's just a car."
"I hope we meet again."
"My father is in the hospital."
"Everything went very well."
"See you in a minute."
"I got what I wanted."
"This is my son."
"Is everything ready?"
"He's doing very well."
"That's what we'll do."
"I don't want his shoes."
"I'm going as fast as I can."
"When was the last time?"
"Didn't anyone tell you?"
"We need to see each other."
"What will happen?"
"Do you want to go have a drink?"
"I thought it was him."
"How did you get here?"
"Can I see you for a moment?"
"I would never do that to you."
"I made it myself."
"I'll make you some eggs."
"I'll make you some eggs."
"Let's be clear."
"I'll tell the others."
"Of course you can."
"No, I don't agree."
"What does she like?"
"I should have done something."
"Do you know what you are doing?"
"Look at me, please."
"You did everything you could."
"The door is locked."
"I hope you find it."
"What will we call it?"
"Ask someone else."
"How can you ask me that?"
"Don't say it like that."
"Do you want to know who I am?"
"This is the dimension of imagination."
"I know it's important."
"No, you don't."
"What are we talking about?"
"Did you do it yourself?"
"I want justice to be done."
"The world is coming to an end."
"I never wanted it."
"He is a very kind man."
"It's about time."
"You don't know who I am?"
"Were you expecting someone else?"
"I spread the word."
"You can't say that."
"Let me give you some advice."
"The government has a secret device."
"Listen to what I'm telling you."
"It could be anywhere."
"Someone knocks at the door."
"She's just a kid."
"Yes, you may be right."
"I don't want her."
"You were right all along."
"Thank you for not saying anything."
"Can I take a look?"
"I thought that was clear."
"What did you do with the body?"
"Please forgive me."
"Yes, there is one."
"And that's just the beginning."
"For saving my life."
"Is it that simple?"
"You don't know it yet."
"Did you know I was here?"
"I said the same thing."
"It's up to him."
"No, it's not the same."
"I need this job."
"I think she's here."
"I'll be there as soon as possible."
"They are friends of mine."
"They are friends of mine."
"That was nice of him."
"I will do my best, sir."
"It has your name on it."
"I apologize for all of this."
"There is absolutely nothing."
"I'll call you when I get back."
"Call me if you need anything."
"I want to know where they are."
"I don't know anything about him."
"No one has seen him since."
"For what I did."
"Did you understand?"
"I'll get you a towel."
"I am a police officer."
"You have to be strong."
"Leave her out of it."
"I think I'll stay."
"I thought about all this."
"You do what I say."
"You were right about me."
"It's a very beautiful place."
"It was a long time ago."
"I will take care of him."
"What are you going to do with me?"
"While there is still time."
"You need to relax."
"I'll walk you to the door."
"Do you believe me?"
"Have you tried calling him?"
"I want to take care of you."
"I want to take care of you."
"Someone shot him."
"What more do you need?"
"You don't remember?"
"Do you know what he's talking about?"
"What do you have in your hand?"
"What is normal?"
"You never told me."
"We'll take you home."
"If it makes you happy."
"I've got my eye on him."
"I have something for her."
"Did you think I forgot?"
"You have a package for me."
"I think he's gone."
"No, you shouldn't have."
"You should ask her out."
"I never said anything."
"Is there a difference?"
"It would be the first time."
"It's nice to see you again."
"They didn't tell you anything?"
"What would you like me to do?"
"What would you like me to do?"
"I'll see how he is."
"I wanted to tell you."
"What is truth?"
"How can you be so calm?"
"Who is this guy?"
"We have to go to the airport."
"I'll take some."
"Looks like it's over."
"I was hoping you would know."
"She shouldn't be here."
"Is that clear enough for you?"
"You are far from home."
"From one moment to the next."
"He never said that."
"I haven't even started."
"I have to move on."
"You should be home."
"There is a good chance."
"Is that what you thought?"
"Is that what you thought?"
"I know, I saw it."
"Repeat what you said."
"It's going to take some time."
"I found this on the ground."
"I need a new assistant."
"Tell me something nice."
"You will be more comfortable."
"Are you homesick?"
"Have I ever let you down?"
"I asked him to leave."
"Do you know what time it is?"
"I'll gouge your eyes out."
"No, they won't."
"That's what I say about it."
"You think it's me?"
"You can leave if you want."
"I'll meet you inside."
"Everything seems to be going well."
"I have a surprise for you."
"I think we're there."
"This stays between you and me."
"They must be somewhere."
"Do you know what they do?"
"This is what he said."
"Did you go through my things?"
"I have a story for you."
"I don't dare think about it."
"I see this every day."
"Look what we have here."
"What do they believe?"
"What do you risk?"
"You're right on time."
"I think I am."
"I did something to you."
"I won't say anything more."
"It is a sign from God."
"Who asked your opinion?"
"I had a great day."
"Take what you need."
"I have to go see."
"Not now, please."
"You've never seen her?"
"It's you I love."
"I need some ice."
"Are you ready to go?"
"I want you to keep it."
"What will happen then?"
"Someone has to do it."
"I need a loan."
"He's stubborn."
"Do you know where he is?"
"I think I got it."
"I don't need him."
"I always wanted one."
"I don't read newspapers."
"No, I have no idea."
"You don't know who I am?"
"I guess that's true."
"This is what I need."
"What is he singing?"
"After what you did?"
"You know I love you."
"Can I get you something?"
"It's time to find out."
"Maybe that's just as well."
"We had a great time."
"What are you going to do with them?"
"What do you mean?"
"I hope you're telling the truth."
"I hope you are telling the truth."
"Is he the one who sent you?"
"Is he the one who sent you?"
"Do you know what's happening to me?"
"What is good?"
"Two heads are better than one."
"It's a dream come true."
"I think I got it."
"Do you see what I'm doing?"
"When did he say that?"
"We have to separate."
"I have to do it alone."
"You have to get used to it."
"What happened to you?"
"I'll never tell you."
"This is all new to me."
"And you're telling me that now?"
"She needs her mother."
"I still need you."
"I know you are friends."
"Why are you so sure?"
"It's just the wind."
"What will I do?"
"Why did you do this to us?"
"You've made a lot of progress."
"I'm glad to see you again."
"It'll only take a minute."
"I have to go all the way."
"We are very proud of you."
"It can be anywhere."
"I prefer to do it myself."
"It's been a long night."
"You don't want me anymore?"
"Smoking is prohibited here."
"Honey, what's going on?"
"What do I smell?"
"Look what I bought."
"Because you are my son."
"It's much more than that."
"I'm not going to start now."
"I'm the one who buys it."
"Thank you for giving me a chance."
"I don't have a sister."
"Is he here?"
"About a week ago."
"You don't trust me anymore?"
"No, I don't feel it."
"How could I have known?"
"You've come to the right place."
"You've come to the right place."
"You'd better leave."
"What did you do?"
"I got ahead."
"Do you know why I'm stopping you?"
"Is this a date?"
"Who are you?"
"We'll meet at the hotel."
"She left me a message."
"They are no longer children."
"What's all this for?"
"I know what awaits me."
"I did this for you."
"Please, God."
"You remind me of him."
"Take it, please."
"Thank you for bringing me here."
"He needs to rest."
"I think I have everything."
"I am so proud of you."
"What do you like?"
"This is my life."
"It's time to go home."
"This is your birthday present."
"He told me something."
"I know you'll make it."
"That's a big word."
"It's much better this way."
"We do what we have to do."
"I didn't find any."
"I'm going there."
"Have you ever thought about that?"
"I'm good for nothing."
"Do you have anything to add?"
"I had another dream."
"It's a birthday present."
"I saw you on the news."
"You should be proud of yourself."
"Just what I need."
"This is the last time, I promise."
"Thank you for keeping me company."
"Can I make a suggestion?"
"You will know in due time."
"I hope this helps you."
"I saw it on the news."
"You don't want to marry me?"
"Did he tell you about it?"
"I just arrived."
"And that's fine."
"What did I think?"
"Go ahead, please."
"If you haven't already."
"What's different?"
"Yes, I realize that."
"Are we not men?"
"No, it's not like that."
"Is that what you would do?"
"There is one here."
"She didn't tell me."
"I am reading."
"I want to go home."
"It's worth checking out."
"I need to talk to your father."
"I don't say anything at all."
"Look what happened to him."
"You just told me."
"You just told me."
"You have to believe me."
"What is it worth?"
"It was on TV."
"Your license, please."
"I went to the hospital."
"Yes, whatever you want."
"It's completely different."
"Do you know who I saw?"
"We've known each other since childhood."
"I just received a call."
"Because I know things."
"I will give you money."
"There is a lot of work."
"What are we making?"
"I'm sure you understand."
"Because I don't know."
"I didn't wake up."
"And what do you expect from me?"
"Is it legal?"
"I'm going to take a little walk."
"Do you know where he is now?"
"No, what is it?"
"I'd better go home."
"I haven't started yet."
"You are stronger than that."
"Sorry I doubted you."
"I think everything will be fine."
"Is this really a good idea?"
"I swear on my head."
"I took care of him."
"Is this where you live?"
"That's what they wanted."
"What did he do with it?"
"Is that fair?"
"But there is a price."
"One for all, all for one."
"What's going on?"
"How did you do it?"
"It's really not my day."
"I can and I will."
"Is your husband at home?"
"How can I help you?"
"I think I see it."
"I can't do anything for him."
"I'll have him call you back."
"This is the end of everything."
"That's a lot to take in at once."
"It's somewhere around there."
"I'm going to give you a present."
"I took care of her."
"I'd better go see."
"I have a present for you."
"I have to tell him the truth."
"You would have done the same for me."
"I already have an appointment."
"It looks like someone else."
"I said anything."
"Where would I go?"
"What do I believe?"
"I tried to explain to him."
"I was wondering how you were doing."
"It's time to go."
"You're not ready yet."
"But it's important to me."
"What's holding us back?"
"You don't have any friends?"
"You should be in school."
"It's locked from the inside."
"We have things in common."
"You need a drink."
"That's all that's true."
"Where does all this come from?"
"And how do we go about it?"
"Would you like to go out with me?"
"Can't we go any faster?"
"How can you tell me that?"
"I have a package for you."
"It only happened once."
"What are you doing here so early?"
"Maybe she's right."
"If I'm lucky."
"I think it's great."
"But what if it is?"
"It was my grandfather's."
"I think I did it."
"I need a job."
"Where did you get this idea?"
"How are we going to do this?"
"The restroom, please?"
"Stand up, please."
"What are you selling?"
"I hope you are happy."
"I brought you some clothes."
"I knew we would make it."
"You are taller than me."
"Are you surprised to see me?"
"I wanted to talk to you."
"I have to call him."
"I'm going to get myself a soda."
"And I never will be."
"Who told you my name?"
"I'll teach him a lesson."
"It scares me a little."
"You don't have time anymore."
"I can't handle this."
"I would like to tell you something."
"I asked myself the question."
"What are you going to do with this?"
"I know what you're going through."
"I know what you're going through."
"It's good for morale."
"I have to take it."
"Let's see what we have here."
"It's more than a coincidence."
"We heard about you."
"Do you remember Miss Simms?"
"She has to go to the hospital."
"Can I ask you a favor?"
"You have until dawn."
"What's special about it?"
"This is a very good thing."
"What are you bringing back?"
"And you let him do it?"
"Are you giving up?"
"You know what I was thinking?"
"They are not men."
"Please talk to me."
"The future of rock 'n' roll."
"I need to get dressed."
"I can't allow this."
"I did it all by myself."
"I'm not there yet."
"We must stick together."
"Can you do it for me?"
"He's one of the weirdos."
"No, it's not going to work."
"Do you know what you're saying?"
"Thank you for coming tonight."
"I'm the one who invites you."
"He ran away."
"I wanted to ask you a question."
"It's going to take me some time."
"I think we've got it."
"I think I messed up."
"We have other things to do."
"I know you have it."
"In English, please."
"A rock sees better than him."
"Do you know who you're talking to?"
"You have other things to do."
"What is real?"
"Do you want us to walk you home?"
"I'm glad to meet you."
"Did you do it for me?"
"It's wonderful to see you."
"We will do whatever you want."
"You've never been there."
"That's totally me."
"There's nothing you can do for him."
"We must go all the way."
"Would you like a cup of coffee?"
"Tell us what's going on."
"I didn't listen to him."
"Sorry for scaring you."
"What do you want to do tonight?"
"Is this what you want?"
"I want you by my side."
"You see what I'm saying?"
"I'm starting to get used to it."
"It feels good to get out."
"Man's best friend."
"I try not to think about it."
"This is for your own safety."
"This is the best thing to do."
"The name rings a bell."
"And what's that for?"
"How long will this last?"
"Do you know why you are here?"
"Do you want me to tell you?"
"I might have one."
"I'm delighted to be here."
"I don't know exactly."
"I did it twice."
"Did you say goodbye to him?"
"I've heard that name before."
"Whether you like it or not."
"I didn't see it."
"I only think of her."
"If you take it like that."
"It's a play."
"I am dreaming."
"That's what interests me."
"See you later, then."
"You don't want me?"
"I made a copy of it."
"Is she the one who sent you?"
"Did you tell him about us?"
"I think it's done."
"I'm going to cook for you."
"I ask you to marry me."
"I don't know anything about that."
"It's rare these days."
"Do you need anything else?"
"I have some work for you."
"Can I tell you a secret?"
"Well, I have to go."
"This way, please."
"I was kind of expecting it."
"I'll talk to my wife about it."
"Have you heard about us?"
"Another one, please."
"What happened then?"
"Find the road to Earth."
"Look what he did."
"You want to go to the Island."
"I thought you would say that."
"Mr. Jameson, your online wife."
"I thought you might like it."
"No, you don't."
"It's more serious than that."
"I'm going to introduce you to someone."
"Don't pay attention to them."
"At least, that's my opinion."
"But it's more than that."
"Do you think it's him?"
"At this point."
"She's not coming with us."
"Not as far as I'm concerned."
"I was just doing my job."
"I've been waiting for half an hour."
"There are many reasons."
"She'll be here in a minute."
"Here's what we're going to do."
"Do you think I'm having fun?"
"Your father had a stroke."
"I'm fine the way I am."
"I thought of one thing."
"I have to get it out."
"This might be the right one."
"I want you to talk to me."
"I'll be there in an hour."
"And you know it very well."
"From one moment to the next."
"It will be an honor for me."
"I'll be ten minutes."
"I have to go to the pharmacy."
"It will cheer you up."
"I'm out of breath."
"I'm ready to go."
"I want to know who you are."
"I asked him the question."
"What color are your eyes?"
"They do what they can."
"We have to find him."
"How are things down there?"
"This better be important."
"I hope you are having fun."
"How did your interview go?"
"You remember him, right?"
"Well, that's a start."
"What do you eat?"
"I'll make you an offer."
"Why did you bring him here?"
"A lot of things happened."
"Don't you have anything better to do?"
"I can leave whenever I want."
"Can I have a copy?"
"Yes, I remember you."
"I had never noticed it."
"We must move forward."
"We must move forward."
"Can I talk to you for a second?"
"Why do you need us?"
"I thought you liked that."
"Thank you for coming."
"Maybe they're right."
"Take this, please."
"This is never a good sign."
"Can we have some music?"
"What really happened?"
"I have some in the car."
"But you already know that."
"Look where that got me."
"But business is business."
"He took care of me."
"I am not a woman."
"I tried to be nice."
"We both win."
"But we did nothing."
"We haven't found anything yet."
"And what did he do?"
"That's noble of you."
"What does he do for a living?"
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"No, it's better this way."
"It's a way of life."
"I wanted to keep you updated."
"Tell me you forgive me."
"Thank you for coming with me."
"Everyone home."
"I was taken by surprise."
"Does this name sound familiar to you?"
"I didn't call her."
"I want you to take it."
"I love you too, my son."
"Can I talk to you for a minute?"
"What was his name again?"
"I know everything will be okay."
"We need to talk to you."
"I should have said something."
"We'll take you home."
"Are you hungover?"
"I'm fine like this."
"It's as old as the hills."
"She is giving birth."
"You'll see when we get there."
"It's a very beautiful name."
"I said goodbye to him."
"Did you let him touch you?"
"What do you know about love?"
"I have to ask you some questions."
"I know where the money is."
"It's for your own good."
"I'll start at the beginning."
"Don't come near me anymore."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"How can you be sure?"
"Did I ask you something?"
"It's like a dream."
"It's a bribe."
"He will get what he deserves."
"You used me."
"This is our first date."
"How did you get here?"
"What else can you do?"
"You've always been like this."
"Have you heard about this?"
"I'm waiting for a phone call."
"You are very sure of yourself."
"It was just a kiss."
"But they are not."
"Do you want to have some fun?"
"What does this imply?"
"I thought about it all night."
"I really need to talk to you."
"Does this make sense to you?"
"There is just one thing."
"This is my way of doing things."
"There is a woman here."
"That's what they are."
"Nothing will happen to you."
"It's just a word."
"How long do you need?"
"How much time do you need?"
"Someone is at the door."
"I can do anything."
"I think we are ready."
"What did he talk about?"
"I want what is mine."
"Men are all the same."
"We did a good job."
"You have little time left."
"It's good quality."
"You can leave whenever you want."
"I thought you would be happy."
"No further questions, Your Honor."
"As I always have."
"I'm more in the know."
"I thought you were gone."
"I thought you were gone."
"You are one of them."
"I was hoping we could talk."
"No, I would never do that."
"I take a look."
"This is my workplace."
"You're a good little guy."
"There are only two of us left."
"How could she do that?"
"Call me, please."
"What kind of doctor are you?"
"I will pay whatever it takes."
"I don't recommend it."
"I think about you all the time."
"I'll go with you."
"He laughed at me."
"But there is one condition."
"What kind of person does that?"
"Everyone is getting involved."
"I can smell it in the air."
"I'm glad to hear it."
"It cost him his life."
"How did the flight go?"
"There must be a solution."
"No one has ever done that."
"I'm glad to see you again."
"I know how you feel."
"See how easy it is?"
"I don't want a woman."
"Please call Central Service."
"After what happened?"
"What does he eat?"
"It was self-defense."
"I'm fine, I assure you."
"What are we?"
"There must be something else."
"Do you have any ID?"
"I came to say goodbye."
"No, I don't like it."
"Do you have something to hide?"
"Do you have something to hide?"
"You have the right to know."
"Can't you tell me?"
"Excuse us, please."
"Where did you learn English?"
"I'm a tough guy."
"Do you want to meet?"
"Tell me what's happening to you."
"How do you plan to do this?"
"How does this happen?"
"You do it all the time."
"Yes, I will take care of it."
"No need to say more."
"Do you want me to introduce you?"
"Is there another woman?"
"Do you know what's going on?"
"How do you know where I live?"
"I'll make you some tea."
"Not sure?"
"I always wanted a son."
"No, it can't be."
"What are you studying?"
"We should do this more often."
"Where did he take her?"
"I came to say goodbye to you."
"It's one o'clock in the morning."
"I am a businessman."
"Do you think this is true?"
"Are you sure you're ready?"
"I waited all night."
"Do you want to get married?"
"How much is there?"
"No one else will."
"God knows I tried."
"Let me see what you've got."
"I'm going to put you to bed."
"You don't know anything about him."
"What more do you want to know?"
"Thank you for your visit."
"Can I get you a drink?"
"Thank you for pointing this out to me."
"We are talking."
"Let me buy you a drink."
"How did the meeting go?"
"I need a miracle."
"You are dreaming."
"Take whatever you want."
"Do you remember his name?"
"No need to do that."
"I never thought about it."
"No, I can't do it."
"I'm talking to myself."
"I have some late work."
"You'll only get one chance."
"That's generous of you."
"I told him to wait."
"How did you get my address?"
"Where have you been?"
"When are you coming home?"
"He's an FBI agent."
"On your mother's head?"
"I was expecting someone else."
"It's okay, they're gone."
"Do you want to talk about it?"
"No, you don't have to."
"I thought I'd find you there."
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"Do you think I'm interested?"
"I think we did it."
"You can see it in his eyes."
"I do it every day."
"As you asked me."
"It's nothing extraordinary."
"She needs to rest."
"Have you done any weight training?"
"They know I'm here."
"They have heavy artillery."
"I love them both."
"I do what I do."
"It's me she wants."
"It's not the same at all."
"I know it, I feel it."
"You better go."
"Have you never been there?"
"I've never taken any."
"Where are we going?"
"I have to do something."
"He used you."
"It's closed from the outside."
"Do you know what awaits you?"
"I thought you stopped."
"I am so proud of you."
"I promised to protect them."
"How did it start?"
"You can go there on foot."
"It's my reason for living."
"He'll be here for a while."
"We'll have to take care of it."
"It looks very good."
"Because I decided so."
"How did you get this number?"
"There's a lot going on."
"I'm in charge of the police."
"I think we should leave."
"I'm giving a hand."
"Where do you think you're going like this?"
"I am not the police."
"I won't do that to him."
"I saw her this morning."
"I want you so much."
"I know what you're looking for."
"He's been there for a while."
"I've known it from the beginning."
"I'll make you a sandwich."
"No, that's not my type."
"He must have changed his mind."
"No, it's not enough."
"It is government property."
"You don't want to get married?"
"Do you know where she is?"
"Of course you know that."
"It was in another life."
"Maybe I have a chance."
"No, I wasn't there."
"How can I trust you?"
"For the rest of my life."
"They didn't see it."
"There will be other opportunities."
"I'm going to ask you something."
"Maybe you should go."
"No, it's not my thing."
"She was very lucky."
"Because I did it."
"I have some things to take care of."
"It's just like I remember."
"I know where the exit is."
"Please keep me updated."
"Can't get enough?"
"I think you were right."
"It's not yours."
"You should have told us."
"From one end to the other."
"The one I told you about."
"Of course I knew that."
"I left it there."
"The witness may return to his seat."
"It was just an idea."
"It wasn't an argument."
"I am very happy for you."
"I am very happy for you."
"Because you can't."
"You know what I like?"
"Wait here, please."
"I have to tell you the truth."
"I guess it's me."
"No need to add anything."
"You don't want to?"
"I can tell you now."
"An autograph, please."
"I still don't know."
"Do you want to go eat?"
"What are we waiting for?"
"I'm busy at the moment."
"How are things going between you?"
"Who knows I'm here?"
"My father is a noble man."
"Who else is with you?"
"It's good to know."
"I will do whatever it takes."
"I want to surprise him."
"I like that in a man."
"We're going to have fun together."
"One for you, one for me."
"You can do anything."
"What do I think about what?"
"Can't get enough?"
"I'm glad to meet you."
"I'll clear this up."
"It's nice to see you again."
"Because he's my son."
"Do you want something to eat?"
"Did you see who's here?"
"Did you see who's there?"
"At the end of the corridor on the right."
"She took me by surprise."
"Do you want some fruit juice?"
"This is one of my favorites."
"Maybe I should call him."
"What do you know about war?"
"There is still some space left."
"You have done everything possible."
"That's what I wanted to hear."
"It's more my age."
"What's going on?"
"You didn't ask him?"
"Where did she come from?"
"I'm just having fun."
"I need you so much."
"I haven't done any."
"I told you to leave."
"I asked myself questions."
"You need to dig a little deeper."
"You are no longer children."
"I can stay if you want."
"I had to make a choice."
"What is he doing?"
"I know how to get out of here."
"What did you think?"
"That's all that matters."
"It's time to wake up."
"What are you talking about?"
"I'm at my wit's end."
"I would like to speak to my lawyer."
"I know what's going to happen."
"I get that from my mother."
"It gets on my nerves."
"I'm so proud of him."
"We have a guest room."
"You need a doctor."
"That seems like a good idea to me."
"No, I want to stay with you."
"Since I was little."
"She had a miscarriage."
"But it never happened."
"No, you're not."
"Think about what you are doing."
"How did he do it?"
"It is very important to us."
"He needs his father."
"The great battle of our time."
"I'll take care of it right away."
"It's my father's."
"How was your flight?"
"Who gave you my number?"
"Tell me what happened."
"No, you don't love me."
"Can I drop you off somewhere?"
"It's safer that way."
"I came to see you."
"There are a lot of them."
"I love him like a brother."
"I came to see how you are."
"She used me."
"Have you spoken to the police?"
"Here is the best of music."
"I did this for us."
"Because I'm a girl?"
"It's a collector's item."
"I want you to go there."
"I have never been in love."
"Driving license and registration document."
"What is it, sir?"
"I feel safe here."
"I did it anyway."
"But it's a good idea."
"Take as many as you want."
"How did you do this?"
"At least, not for me."
"But this time it's different."
"It will be necessary to start again on occasion."
"You can't do anything for him."
"Maybe we'll see each other again."
"Maybe it was a dream."
"Thank you for the vote of confidence."
"Maybe a little of both."
"What did he do to her?"
"You don't have to."
"How about we talk about something else?"
"She never said it."
"Do you want some orange juice?"
"I'll join you inside."
"Maybe tomorrow, who knows?"
"There are better things to do."
"I hope I live up to it."
"I know how to take care of myself."
"Tea, please."
"This is me with my mother."
"He was just a kid."
"Do you still have much time left?"
"I'm going to get myself a coffee."
"Glad to have you on board."
"You should go see a doctor."
"You don't look like it."
"Those were the days, huh?"
"We are meant to be together."
"I like to dress like a woman."
"You told me to come."
"Tell me a little about yourself."
"I really need you."
"But I have good news."
"It's just a comedy."
"I'll get another one."
"It's a guy thing."
"She has no name."
"Come here, please."
"Who are you to judge me?"
"Do you remember anything else?"
"Do you remember anything else?"
"I know what he is."
"It was my father's."
"I take full responsibility for this."
"I take full responsibility for it."
"I want something in return."
"I know it's over."
"Wait for me, please."
"Are you on your period or something?"
"I know where he went."
"What's interesting?"
"What scares you?"
"Do you have a picture of him?"
"I've never been here."
"You did this for me?"
"Let's go, everyone."
"It was different back then."
"I thought it was me."
"There has been a change."
"I never said that."
"This applies to all of you."
"I have no answers."
"Look what we have here."
"We welcome you five out of five."
"I need you to come back."
"She sent me."
"Please remain seated."
"I'll be here for a few hours."
"I told you to back off."
"Have you never been in love?"
"I never asked him."
"You knew, didn't you?"
"It is an act of war."
"He stepped on a mine."
"Can you give us a moment?"
"We found this on him."
"I want you to listen to me."
"We'll take care of everything."
"Maybe it's better."
"But it will take time."
"I think everything is ready."
"I thought we were friends."
"May he rest in peace."
"You should have thought of that before."
"You should have thought of that before."
"There are people outside."
"I'm part of the team."
"Can we see this later?"
"He is a very important man."
"This just happened to you."
"Yes, who is speaking?"
"Look in the glove compartment."
"What if I had?"
"Tell them what you know."
"Thank you for accepting my invitation."
"And who told you that?"
"Are you sure you're ready?"
"Who sent you?"
"That's all, I swear."
"I like it like that."
"That's what we hope."
"These things take time."
"I didn't need it."
"We will take care of you."
"I wish you a beautiful life."
"No, it's a good thing."
"It's because of her."
"After what he did?"
"It's my turn to play."
"You can join us."
"And that's just the beginning."
"Do you know how it happened?"
"What awaits me?"
"There is so much to do."
"Do you think he'll come back?"
"I'll call you when I arrive."
"I've been working on it for years."
"I get that from my father."
"It's my lunch time."
"He shot himself."
"I know you were there."
"This is a genius idea."
"Do you want to talk about it?"
"Do you know what that represents?"
"I think it can work."
"I have to be there."
"I thought you were done."
"That's what it says."
"No, I was just saying that."
"The keys are inside."
"I hope you like it."
"I have things to say."
"We'll see you at home."
"I'll never get out of here."
"What did she have?"
"I just spoke to him."
"I gave you a gift."
"Look at the state I'm in."
"What did she look like?"
"Where did you get all this?"
"I know he loves me."
"There is a reason."
"Is it over?"
"Please hurry."
"Don't you want to know why?"
"Is there another entrance?"
"What do you understand?"
"Do you have family here?"
"And this is for you."
"I got you a coffee."
"You asked me a question."
"Have you been drinking?"
"Are you looking at me?"
"But there is one thing."
"I know how to manage on my own."
"You want to play it like that?"
"Next, please."
"How dare you ask me that?"
"What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
"For now, anyway."
"Who could it be?"
"He said it was fine."
"After the rain comes the good weather."
"What do I think?"
"No, we're not finished."
"Let me explain something to you."
"Let me explain something to you."
"These are just questions."
"I need to speak to him in private."
"I had a good day."
"I will always be near you."
"Let's see how you do."
"I give you five out of five."
"She didn't believe me."
"Where did you get this information from?"
"I need your car."
"Give it your all."
"Here we go, here we go."
"So you haven't learned anything?"
"What's said is said."
"You will get what you pay for."
"That's what it was."
"We don't care about that."
"Of course I can."
"There's a lot at stake."
"How are things up there?"
"He's the one who has it."
"Thanks, but I have to go."
"I can get us out of here."
"Where is it going?"
"You have something of mine."
"Did someone ask you something?"
"I need light."
"Because you are my friend."
"I thought you would know."
"I can't think."
"Made for each other."
"I really want this to work."
"He's a really good guy."
"If it is not the case?"
"It's better than sex."
"I'll tell your mother."
"I had a great time."
"You can really annoy me."
"It's you who interests me."
"Are you saying that to me?"
"This is the best of the best."
"Can I see you for a moment?"
"What can happen?"
"Do you have what it takes?"
"I thought we were partners."
"Maybe I shouldn't."
"I want to have fun."
"I have to show you something."
"What if he's telling the truth?"
"Hold this, please."
"She belonged to my grandfather."
"I wanted to surprise you."
"Do you agree with me?"
"Do you agree with me?"
"In the name of the good old days."
"I'm happy to be here."
"I'm happy to be here."
"See you at rehearsal."
"We can go anywhere."
"She needs a doctor."
"Don't blame me."
"It's nice of you to stop by."
"Do you want my picture, friend?"
"Like most of us."
"I hope he's right."
"Is anyone down there?"
"He came home."
"Is it safe?"
"Look on the bright side."
"I'll walk you back to your car."
"You know what I was doing?"
"What did he say to her?"
"Put your arms around me."
"You are here for a reason."
"I could ask you the same question."
"I did well."
"Do you know what you want?"
"There must be some."
"Have you tried calling him?"
"Take the time you need."
"I'm always on your side."
"You do this all the time."
"What is this?"
"I've been waiting my whole life."
"Can I show you something?"
"I made breakfast."
"I see it on your face."
"What are you playing?"
"Once is not a custom."
"We have a mission to accomplish."
"I told him no."
"How are you going to do this?"
"Oh my God, oh my God."
"You don't remember anything?"
"I only know how to do that."
"What is important?"
"You haven't thought about it?"
"You have a decision to make."
"I need an opinion."
"Give him some time."
"Can I have another one?"
"You know what's great?"
"These are the rules of the game."
"This is what they are waiting for."
"I've waited for you for so long."
"I hired a private detective."
"So, how did it go?"
"Are you the one doing this?"
"I am one of his friends."
"You haven't seen them?"
"When was it taken?"
"It's time to get up."
"You've never met him?"
"But he's a good guy."
"Maybe, I don't know."
"I don't know who to believe anymore."
"It seems like yesterday."
"He looks very good."
"I have a gift for her."
"But I need you."
"Because I'm asking you to."
"Milk and ice cream?"
"It has your name on it."
"Go see what's going on."
"Have you ever seen this girl?"
"It can't be."
"And it's thanks to you."
"I don't know the rules."
"He's here, he's here."
"The floor is given to the defense."
"There's always something."
"We took care of everything."
"I could be anyone."
"Who could do such a thing?"
"Tell me it's true."
"We wanted to surprise you."
"Do you know what it is?"
"I didn't hear them."
"He is heading north."
"I told him to come home."
"She can't stay here."
"This is what I found."
"And you know what else?"
"What started it?"
"I was thinking."
"I need two volunteers."
"You can trust me."
"I remember this case."
"No, she wasn't."
"I already took one."
"Have fun, both of you."
"You're an hour late."
"He needs air."
"No, you don't."
"You can't hide anything from me."
"Bottled by my father."
"They don't know."
"Better not to think about it."
"I wanted everything to be perfect."
"What time is our train?"
"At the end of the corridor, on the right."
"I saw you in court."
"I tried to contact you."
"I never asked for that."
"Did you act in a pilot?"
"I know what you would say."
"I'll do better than that."
"This is what you did."
"Where did you learn all this?"
"You see what I was saying?"
"And you, what's your name?"
"And you, what is your name?"
"Thank you for coming to pick me up."
"I'm not there yet."
"I'm not there yet."
"What am I waiting for?"
"We don't know anything yet."
"No, I'm not married."
"I had a farm in Africa."
"She is absolutely right."
"I saw him do it."
"Exactly what I need."
"We are all proud of you."
"No, I'm not pregnant."
"We had the best intentions, frankly."
"There are other things."
"You're out of time."
"You don't belong here."
"I remember that day."
"I will always be there for you."
"How can you live like this?"
"I will love you all my life."
"You did a great job."
"She is in the recovery room."
"I never saw her again."
"At the end of the corridor, on the left."
"He knows what I know."
"Do you take me for a rookie?"
"I have to get out of here."
"Do you see what he's doing?"
"I hope we stay friends."
"What did you believe?"
"You did well to come."
"I should have known."
"Nothing to do with luck."
"What's really going on?"
"Who is shooting?"
"Go ahead, I'll take care of it."
"She wanted to tell me something."
"Anyway, thanks."
"I think it's you."
"I'll go take a look."
"I feel like I do."
"Have you ever done this before?"
"Are you sure you want it?"
"Do you want to stay and have fun?"
"How can I trust you?"
"I can't do this right now."
"It's a family jewel."
"I just have a quick question."
"What else do you want to know?"
"You didn't even try."
"There is always a girl."
"I know you understand me."
"This is the house of the Lord."
"I have to ask you something."
"There must be one."
"I'm going to ask you something."
"I know what you were doing."
"You are not his father."
"I'll be here when you come back."
"I don't think so either."
"Don't tell Mom."
"We have a score to settle."
"I've never seen you."
"Maybe we can work something out."
"That's more for me."
"Tell me everything is okay."
"You did well."
"It's four o'clock in the morning."
"Please forgive me."
"It's you I'm looking at."
"It's a matter of principle."
"No one can say otherwise."
"We took different paths."
"I'm going to freshen up a bit."
"There's always something going on."
"I'm trying to make a living."
"Do you have anything to drink?"
"You need to know something."
"I'm looking forward to it."
"How did I get here?"
"I'll meet you at home."
"And you, what did you do?"
"And you, what did you do?"
"Can't you do better?"
"Did I talk to you?"
"I have a deadline to meet."
"I have to get him out of there."
"You have to see her."
"You have little choice."
"What do you need?"
"I think I've got it."
"Will I see you again?"
"Did you really just say that?"
"More than you can imagine."
"I would like to tell you something."
"It goes straight to my heart."
"Don't order me around."
"He is in the recovery room."
"I've been saying it from the beginning."
"Don't tell your father anything."
"Let's settle this once and for all."
"We're just having fun."
"I have to find them."
"We might have a lead."
"I feel much better, thank you."
"Of course it's important."
"Look what she did."
"It's a real headache."
"He kicks."
"I spoke to his mother."
"I wasn't there."
"What is your opinion of me?"
"That's nice of them."
"What were you looking for?"
"What, you don't believe me?"
"Do you know why you are here?"
"You're the doc, Doc."
"How am I supposed to do this?"
"I don't even know."
"I have a reputation to uphold."
"I'll try to find it."
"You don't have any parents?"
"I was just a child."
"It was no secret."
"I needed someone."
"I have to pull myself together."
"Yes, but for how long?"
"We will see the details later."
"Give me some water."
"What he says is true."
"What's he doing there?"
"At the end of the week."
"What do you plan to do with this?"
"Where have you been all this time?"
"How did you do this?"
"I know where we can go."
"I only found that."
"I have answered your questions."
"Who allowed you in?"
"I know what's been stalking you."
"One Ring to rule them all."
"You don't trust him?"
"I want a child from you."
"You think I don't know?"
"I had the same dream."
"Do you have anything to declare?"
"Have you never seen one?"
"No, don't go."
"What does that make you think of?"
"They know it's you."
"All this is for you."
"There must be something."
"It's time to close."
"You know who I mean?"
"You're going to do me a favor."
"No, I'm not angry."
"I'll give you something to eat."
"What are you doing right now?"
"What are you doing right now?"
"I know that's a lot."
"I'll meet you inside."
"You knew this was going to happen."
"You are so good to me."
"Because I asked him."
"Want some company?"
"Didn't you hear it?"
"I would like to have a word with you."
"What does he mean by that?"
"What do you guys say?"
"I wrote it for you."
"She's the one who has it."
"Do you know what you are?"
"I couldn't find anything else."
"I have no opinion."
"I'll have another drink."
"This is what we should do."
"There are other jobs."
"He is what he is."
"I thought she loved me."
"Tell me you love me."
"This is real life."
"I'm going to stay here for a while."
"What did you just call me?"
"I thought about her a lot."
"I do what is right."
"It's holy water."
"It's much better this way."
"That's always something."
"I'll come back later."
"Your role in history continues."
"That will be all for now."
"The fluid passes into his lungs."
"Come on, let's get this over with."
"I'll get you a drink."
"I've been waiting for this moment for a long time."
"I'm glad to hear from you."
"What do you think it is?"
"The honeymoon is over."
"You never loved me."
"What's there?"
"There was traffic."
"But no, that's not it."
"He took me by surprise."
"And the rest of the family?"
"I have a letter for you."
"It's nice to meet you."
"He may have done it."
"Give me a scene."
"She was just a child."
"I know you can."
"Here come the days of the King."
"It's just a memory."
"Take the safest route."
"Can you protect me from you?"
"You're not like that anymore."
"What do you want?"
"What's the hurry?"
"And that's what matters."
"What would you like?"
"I thought you liked him."
"He grew up on the streets."
"I don't owe you anything anymore."
"Tell him it's important."
"I wanted to know how you were doing."
"We have to hide."
"There are tons of them."
"I learned it by heart."
"Do you want me to stay here?"
"The one to whom you owe allegiance."
"What are they doing?"
"Nobody calls me that."
"Think about what you say."
"Did you tell them about me?"
"Maybe this is our chance."
"Where did this happen?"
"I'll be there in five minutes."
"There's plenty for two."
"I hope you can make it."
"There is always a choice."
"It's going to be a beautiful day."
"What brings you here?"
"Do you call him by his first name?"
"How long does she have?"
"Faster, please."
"I didn't send it."
"Do you know where it is?"
"What is he doing on my front page?"
"It's a real one."
"You've never seen him?"
"I had to say it."
"I don't have any family anymore."
"What was it like at school?"
"I was dreaming."
"I was hoping you would be there."
"This may be the end."
"It's not yours."
"I told you my name."
"I'll try to fix that."
"I believe he is telling the truth."
"How do you know if it's true?"
"I need a job."
"Who told you about me?"
"I have never been so happy."
"We have so much to say to each other."
"Do you see him in this courtroom?"
"I've been there twice."
"I need to talk to him urgently."
"Forewarned is forearmed."
"You are a man of your word."
"I asked you to leave."
"This is the end of the movie."
"Can you give me your address?"
"I am in a delicate situation."
"You end up getting used to it."
"Do you know who my father is?"
"I've already told you about it."
"I'm going to teach you something."
"It will do you good."
"Since when has she been like this?"
"I take this very seriously."
"Listen to me, please."
"Do you know what time it is?"
"I release you from my service."
"You better not know."
"What does that mean, exactly?"
"I always wanted to do it."
"Do you want to do me a favor?"
"You have to be there."
"I hope she gets better."
"She says it."
"It's quiet right now."
"You are not the same anymore."
"How did you do this?"
"It goes both ways."
"She never did that."
"No, I don't want to."
"No, we don't have any."
"We've come all this way."
"Did you know what was going to happen?"
"You already told me that."
"It's time for me to go home."
"We have to face facts."
"Do you hear what they're saying?"
"Don't you agree?"
"Just what I needed."
"This is my wedding present."
"We have a surprise for you."
"I wanted you to see it."
"I can write you a check."
"I overreacted."
"Nice to have you with us."
"You're not finished yet?"
"Do you think it will work?"
"Thank you for coming to see me."
"He was one of us."
"I'm willing to believe that."
"Can you point it out to the jurors?"
"It's coffee time."
"There is surely a solution."
"What if I came with you?"
"In my office, right away."
"Thank you for cheering me up."
"Can I get you a beer?"
"I will give you money."
"I was at the end of my rope."
"I wanted to see how you were doing."
"What I say is true."
"No, you don't owe me anything."
"Do you know what that means?"
"I want to talk to you for a moment."
"Because I don't want to."
"It was about time you arrived."
"I told them to leave."
"You must not come here."
"Do you see this?"
"Is this where you live?"
"But we have the White Magician."
"Can I talk to you for a second?"
"It's a family reunion."
"Maybe in another life."
"Someone told me."
"This is what I want to hear."
"Do you remember anything else?"
"That's what we will do."
"I'm really happy for you."
"He did well."
"Thanks for getting me out."
"She never loved you."
"I wanted to ask you a question."
"The southern road is monitored."
"Your country needs you."
"Do you want to kiss?"
"I'm aware of that."
"Don't think about that now."
"I'm doing very well."
"I wanted to show you something."
"I think you are."
"How do you say 'friend' in Elvish?"
"I'm the one who's going to speak."
"That's what it's for, folks."
"I've always wanted to."
"Here is what I propose to you."
"There are a lot of people."
"I want to talk to my father."
"I saw it too."
"How could I do this?"
"I had her on the phone."
"It's on my mind too."
"What else do you need?"
"I can get you out of here."
"I know it's early."
"I don't recommend it."
"I had a great idea."
"One service is worth another."
"Call me back as soon as you can."
"It's just a photo."
"I've never heard of it."
"You have been a good friend."
"No, you're not."
"And you, what are you doing here?"
"Could I have some water?"
"I know exactly who you are."
"What happened to the baby?"
"You are so much more than that."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"The last pages are for you."
"No, you're not going anywhere."
"It's my lucky number."
"I want to be done with this."
"This is a work in progress."
"Do you remember anything?"
"The hunter becomes the hunter."
"We had a big argument."
"I can't hear myself think anymore."
"This is a police investigation."
"They have to get you away from here."
"I need your signature."
"This is what we expected."
"Let me take care of you."
"No, and I don't care."
"I thought we were friends."
"As if you didn't know."
"I think I'm ready."
"Yes, it's a long story."
"Do you really want me to come?"
"Oh, that looks good."
"The man I wanted to see."
"I don't recognize anything at all."
"Do you think that's it?"
"I am here to protect you."
"I would like you to accompany me."
"I went to school."
"I agree with them."
"I never get tired of it."
"I heard about her."
"Thank you for coming."
"God, the girls loved him."
"Please follow me."
"Take as much as you want."
"What's all the noise?"
"And you never will be."
"I need your phone."
"Where does this leave us?"
"What did you do last night?"
"The world needs you."
"Where does he live?"
"I'll leave it to you."
"I'll leave it to you."
"My time, my city, my family."
"No, we're not going anywhere."
"Come closer, please."
"She told me about you."
"He's been doing this for years."
"Dad, we need to talk."
"How are we going to get out of here?"
"I was just wondering."
"Let's see what we can find."
"I'll wait for you in the car."
"It didn't happen."
"We have things to do."
"Do we know who did this?"
"Who put that in there?"
"I'm going to need this."
"You are right about one thing."
"Do I have to do everything myself?"
"It's hidden under your bed."
"Have you taken drugs?"
"Don't lecture me."
"I'll try to talk to him."
"These are the basic principles."
"I have some things to do."
"You will tell me about it."
"There are guards everywhere."
"I need to talk to you for a minute."
"Do you have anything planned?"
"I don't play golf."
"They are not the only ones."
"I'm sure she'll understand."
"And how are we going to do that?"
"He still has a lot to learn."
"I will answer all your questions."
"I'll call you back in an hour."
"Take what you need."
"Take what you need."
"Friends don't do that."
"How much time do you need?"
"Bring the wood and the oil."
"How did the operation go?"
"We have scores to settle."
"What is he hiding?"
"I am not a victim."
"You get that from your father."
"I wish we could be friends."
"I hope you're happy."
"I hope you're happy."
"I think he's ready."
"There is no cure."
"I didn't invite them."
"This one is really good."
"I loved him more than anything."
"It only happens once."
"They will be here in an hour."
"I thought you were friends."
"Can I sit with you?"
"But we will still go into battle."
"I was hoping you were here."
"But he didn't come."
"I knew she was there."
"Is that what you say?"
"I need more than that."
"You didn't say it."
"It's easier for you."
"What is your phone number?"
"Can you tell me your name?"
"You have it."
"He's one of my men."
"Thousands of people running."
"I made you something to eat."
"I think I know him."
"You didn't expect that?"
"What will they do with us?"
"He told me to come."
"Don't say it like that."
"It's high-end."
"I have no questions."
"I thought you liked that."
"I don't know anything about you."
"Glad you liked it."
"Glad you liked it."
"You have to live with the times."
"No, you can't enter."
"I'm the one inviting you."
"I was glad to see you."
"I knew I knew you."
"I remember this place."
"I spoke to my mother."
"I just wanted to say goodbye."
"Have you heard of him?"
"Do you agree with that?"
"I wanted to surprise him."
"I wanted to wish you good luck."
"Do you know what he does?"
"Do you think this will work?"
"I've heard about it before."
"I thought it was good."
"There is a price on his head."
"Better not to talk about it."
"I don't have a partner."
"I'll get you something to eat."
"Be careful what you wish for."
"I can't call him."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"You don't have to answer."
"It seems like everything is fine."
"What do you think it is?"
"You'll find someone else."
"The dark side of the Moon."
"Who do you think it is?"
"I'll be a little late."
"Maybe it's a chance."
"Do you have some time?"
"All right, I have to go."
"It's you I choose."
"You're not saying hello to me?"
"Can't we work something out?"
"I'll come by later."
"He invited me to dinner."
"I'll make you something to eat."
"You made fun of me."
"I have a favor to ask."
"We're one step ahead."
"I said I was coming."
"I slit his throat."
"You are here to advise him."
"She is a very pretty girl."
"Let me show you something."
"I hope you find it."
"Do you want me to carry you?"
"What are you doing in my office?"
"I want a glass of water."
"I can take you to him."
"I'm going to be on TV."
"She threw herself at me."
"I often have the same dream."
"It was nice to see you."
"You did well to call."
"It's show time."
"I'm going to get back to work."
"I'm starting to wonder."
"I've known her for years."
"You need to rest."
"He's the one who finds you."
"I want to be home for dinner."
"I'm halfway there."
"Maybe we should just let it go."
"An endangered species."
"I have to explain to you."
"It's just sex."
"Yes, you may be right."
"They know we're here."
"I want to introduce you to a friend."
"Do we serve it by the pint?"
"Do what she tells you."
"What do you miss?"
"What if it was the other way around?"
"You came to tell me that?"
"You're going home."
"Can I talk to you for two minutes?"
"You're probably right, as always."
"I took care of everything."
"What kind of woman are you?"
"I have a permit for that."
"Can I have another drink?"
"What are you hoping for?"
"What about that?"
"I have a friend there."
"I am very happy for you."
"I arrived just in time."
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"Of course I would."
"Go ahead, ask Rosie to dance."
"You're going to move to the chair."
"Let me take care of him."
"Ask him what you want."
"They took me by surprise."
"It won't go that far."
"Maybe you should talk to him."
"Is there a connection?"
"Whether you like it or not."
"Yeah, I've heard that before."
"You should be proud of yourself."
"In the south of France."
"I thought you'd like it."
"That's my last name."
"He's still not here."
"You didn't say no."
"I'm going to ask you some questions."
"I need an address."
"I have a knack for it."
"I would like to show you something."
"Of course, you're welcome."
"So what's next?"
"You didn't say it."
"I had some shopping to do."
"That's a good start, right?"
"This is your son."
"See you in a few hours."
"Well, good enough for my companions."
"Do what you want."
"I'm sure you'll find it."
"I knew it was true."
"Did I speak another language?"
"Listen, we need to talk."
"How long can it last?"
"We had fun, didn't we?"
"We'll give you a sedative."
"Did you give him a chance?"
"Don't you want to kiss me?"
"Is everyone in place?"
"This is the truth before God."
"I need to talk to my mother."
"I just wanted to go home."
"I brought you some tea."
"I've been here since the beginning."
"Both at the same time."
"Would you like a glass of wine?"
"I will take care of you."
"They are not here yet."
"You are very lucky."
"We know it's you."
"You have to make up your mind."
"It's a game of chess."
"I had a wonderful evening."
"Please, not that."
"You don't want me to come?"
"Sign here, please."
"You can answer the question."
"I have his phone number."
"What does this have to do with us?"
"He moved on."
"Across the river."
"I'll take that as a yes."
"Is that where you were?"
"Have you spoken to the police?"
"I come from another planet."
"He might still be there."
"I hope you like it."
"I have to take care of her."
"That's how it works."
"I thought back to our conversation."
"It's a state of mind."
"That's cool, that's cool."
"See you on the other side."
"You've never seen me."
"I was stood up."
"We are on the same team."
"There are bodies everywhere."
"I think it's over."
"Go see the other side."
"Tell me everything will be okay."
"I am much more than that."
"It has my name on it."
"It didn't happen."
"It didn't happen."
"I've been thinking about it for a while."
"What if I don't?"
"I'm going to make your party."
"Well, that's a first."
"She wouldn't have done that."
"It was great to see you."
"We'll talk about it in the car."
"You haven't changed much."
"There is much to say."
"You still have a lot to learn."
"You slept all day."
"Okay, we got it."
"The exception that proves the rule."
"What else do you want to do?"
"Do exactly as I say."
"No, no, you don't understand."
"I hope it gets better."
"Actually, it's very simple."
"The door, please."
"He was very lucky."
"I wrote you a poem."
"I really need to talk."
"Do you know who did it?"
"Do you know who did it?"
"I like it too."
"Please do it."
"Don't try to fool me."
"I have news for you."
"Did I ask your opinion?"
"It's done, it's done."
"See you next week."
"Do you want to know where he is?"
"I need a room."
"It gives me hope."
"Please look at me."
"What do you have in your hand?"
"When do I start?"
"I didn't do it."
"I have to ask you a favor."
"What kind of person are you?"
"Everything is back to normal."
"Can I borrow a pen from you?"
"You were very lucky."
"You can't hide."
"I don't work for him anymore."
"It was what it was."
"You know you like it."
"I know it, I know it."
"I remember, an old guy."
"I love it when you do that."
"I choose the life of mortals."
"Isn't that something?"
"And I want to be with you."
"She's somewhere around there."
"I want to make love to you."
"I gave him life."
"What are you selling?"
"It's better than nothing, right?"
"There was something."
"I'll give you one."
"About a month ago."
"No, I don't have them."
"There is music."
"It's more important than that."
"Very soon he will ask you."
"What's the point of all this?"
"Give it some time."
"You have no proof."
"There was another one."
"I know you are."
"Everything that happened."
"What color are his eyes?"
"I only have her left."
"Have you thought about my proposal?"
"Sounds nice to me."
"It's like a movie."
"And you, what did you do?"
"Tell him to go home."
"I don't know the answers."
"I'll call you in an hour."
"I need an assistant."
"I need an assistant."
"Thank you for being there for me."
"I'll give you a demonstration."
"There is another explanation."
"I want to speak to a manager."
"Don't tell me what to do."
"For the same reason as you."
"For the same reason as you."
"I need a massage."
"Leave me, please."
"How did you get my address?"
"Can you come back in an hour?"
"I had to talk to you."
"Did you do it yourself?"
"Look what I can do."
"How can I trust you?"
"He needs a friend."
"I hope you like it."
"I remember you."
"I think you're ready."
"But you have to go."
"Do you think you'll make it?"
"What are you doing here so late?"
"I have some very good news."
"With ribbons in her hair."
"I keep saying it."
"We studied together."
"I hope you find her again."
"Does she know?"
"What if I did?"
"I can't either."
"You should join us."
"You should join us."
"Do you want to argue?"
"Do you want me to apologize?"
"Thank you for bringing me here."
"It's just the cat."
"I want you to talk to him."
"Keep your eyes on the road."
"Do you want me to call them?"
"I could ask you the same question."
"Would you like some tea?"
"I guess that's it."
"There is a way."
"The operation was a success."
"What are you doing up so late?"
"I love him more than anything."
"And how are you going to do that?"
"I have to get out of here."
"I never did anything."
"I'm on the case, Captain."
"I need a taxi."
"Do you know what I do?"
"I'm just hungry."
"I understand you completely."
"I think she likes you."
"Do you speak English?"
"I can't even read."
"May the Force be with us."
"How are we going to do this?"
"Was I not clear?"
"Can I talk to you for a moment?"
"He only talks about that."
"I met her once."
"The one I gave you?"
"Once or twice a year."
"He's a bit old-fashioned."
"He said he was coming back."
"Just what I need."
"I think that's fair."
"What's special about it?"
"I was born in this house."
"I have a tip for you."
"Put your arm around me."
"I will do my best."
"That's more or less it."
"I have work to finish."
"Does he have a last name?"
"We do as we said."
"On my mother's life."
"Do you have something for me?"
"He will always be dependent on him."
"Can I ask you something?"
"No, it looks good."
"I need a second."
"It looks like it's him."
"And they call that a mine?"
"Where do you want me to go?"
"I have my own idea about that."
"Tell us what's going on."
"I think you know each other."
"Please, this way."
"It was love at first sight."
"There is good news."
"Someone did this to him."
"I got them from my mother."
"This is what you need to do."
"Is it that bad?"
"She needs to be taken care of."
"Six, five, four, three, two, one."
"Who likes to play with me?"
"This is my wife."
"He knows we are here."
"It has never been proven."
"I'll put you on the right track."
"It's about power."
"It was taken out of context."
"That's what they think."
"I see only one solution."
"Do you know where he might be?"
"I thought I told you."
"Do you have a picture of him?"
"Nobody calls me a wimp."
"Do you have somewhere to go?"
"Do you love him more than me?"
"Can I get you something?"
"But I still love you."
"What is it, Father?"
"Something must have happened."
"I did that too."
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"She's just a little girl."
"Are you hungover?"
"I'll get some beer."
"His throat was slit."
"It's longer than expected."
"That's what she believes."
"I knew it would be you."
"There must be a way."
"He will have to hold out until tomorrow."
"What's on your mind?"
"Thank you for lending it to me."
"I need another drink."
"From what I know."
"You don't have a car?"
"I wanted to let you know."
"And I'm proud of you."
"I told you to get out."
"I barely touched her."
"I know more than you."
"Let me tell you a story."
"I think it's getting better."
"Why are you telling me all this?"
"I had business to attend to."
"I want to surprise him."
"How can you be so sure?"
"I'll leave you for a moment."
"Maybe it's just me."
"No, not that I remember."
"He will try to take the Ring."
"I need something else."
"You were never there."
"I thought you had it."
"I've been waiting for this moment for so long."
"After what you did?"
"So what is it all about?"
"It's just luck."
"She might have rabies."
"I didn't think about it anymore."
"I am changing."
"But he never came back."
"I've had better days."
"I'm on the other side."
"Someone has to do this."
"Thank you for agreeing to come."
"You will see that ringing doors."
"Good luck to both of you."
"Is your mother at home?"
"Did you leave the door open?"
"Who knows when we'll see each other again?"
"This is really not funny."
"I'm not going to calm down."
"It's a question of ethics."
"I can't ask you that."
"What kind of man does that?"
"They were never found."
"No, I have to go."
"I think you're looking for me."
"I left you messages."
"Of course it was."
"We need a service."
"I'm getting you out of here."
"Nobody told me about it."
"I am a night owl."
"Everything is fine, it will be fine."
"Everything you need."
"Everything you need."
"I have to leave right away."
"Do you want some fruit juice?"
"Or anyone else."
"I had never experienced that."
"Am I okay?"
"I want to be proud of you."
"There is nothing outside."
"I thought you forgot."
"Do you hear what you're saying?"
"If you don't mind."
"You never were."
"I can do it for you."
"I can do it for you."
"Who do you think you are?"
"It was up to me to decide."
"I need to introduce you to someone."
"Do you know anything about this?"
"We saw each other twice."
"You just have to do it."
"Any idea who it was?"
"I never liked it."
"I did all the tests."
"I go there every day."
"This is what we are looking for."
"Want to see something cool?"
"I think I know her."
"I'm the one who messed up."
"I sent him a text."
"We need to ask you some questions."
"I wanted to stop him."
"He went to the Elves."
"I didn't think this would happen."
"It's a day of celebration."
"I should have started there."
"They are not mine."
"I had never thought of that."
"Do you want me to find out?"
"I may have seen it."
"It sounded better in my head."
"I've been thinking about you a lot."
"Well, look who's here."
"Do you know his name?"
"Look on the bright side."
"I'm looking for one of your clients."
"Dad went 'hunting'."
"Tell her I'll call her back."
"I'll tell you later."
"I want to get them out of there."
"Can I get you a beer?"
"Do you feel that?"
"I think he's sick."
"Do you want to see each other again?"
"I thought I saw something."
"I want to ask you something."
"It's the same every day."
"I'll walk you to your car."
"Can I tell you a secret?"
"And everyone is happy."
"Do you want to make money?"
"I think it was you."
"What's the hurry?"
"I know you know that."
"I am very proud of you."
"I'll look inside."
"Where did you learn to drive?"
"You are what you are."
"How are you getting along?"
"Call me when you're done."
"He locked it from the inside."
"Did you talk to him about that?"
"I mean what I say."
"Do you take credit cards?"
"I see you every day."
"With everything that's going on."
"I just got a call."
"We have to go to the hospital."
"It might be an accident."
"I'm going to tell you something."
"Do you know him?"
"You know what would be cool?"
"What does he look like?"
"He said he loved me."
"Sorry, but that's how it is."
"She is a flight attendant."
"Don't spend it all at once."
"You will be more comfortable."
"And you, what do you think?"
"No stopping before nightfall."
"You have to get me out of here."
"My family needs me."
"What do we take?"
"What exactly is happening?"
"I thought I was dreaming."
"It's just a house."
"Are you out of your mind?"
"She knows what it is."
"There is another man."
"Please forgive me."
"With this ring, I marry you."
"I'm going back to the hotel."
"Let's go see what it is."
"What's next?"
"That's what brings me here."
"I only think of him."
"I think it's obvious."
"What I feared has happened."
"At the beep, you know what to do."
"They're just kids."
"I'm going to leave now."
"I've been coming here for years."
"Did you have a good evening?"
"Did you have a good evening?"
"He arrived before dawn."
"Maybe she knows something."
"Do you love someone else?"
"This is very good advice."
"Look on the bright side."
"He said you would understand."
"I'll give you my number."
"I'm older than you."
"I will answer your questions."
"It's just a question."
"I would like to go home."
"I have to get back to work."
"You want to get rid of me?"
"What are you looking for?"
"What can it do for you?"
"I am not a scientist."
"I'll take care of it myself."
"It was my birthday present."
"No, I don't see it."
"Did you bring me something?"
"At least tell me your name."
"I was homesick."
"I fought for you."
"Do you want to join me?"
"That's where she is."
"Is there a toilet here?"
"I just thought of it."
"I want to go to the beach."
"Of course I think so."
"We both were."
"It's only been a week."
"I found it on the ground."
"No, I didn't know anything about it."
"You did well."
"I apologize to you."
"No, I haven't been drinking."
"I bet that's it."
"The ball is in their court."
"Is she a friend of yours?"
"You've never seen her?"
"I saw it twice."
"Please do it."
"I like you too."
"Let this be a lesson to you."
"They are not servants."
"Is there a God?"
"I think we should talk."
"I need it for work."
"What are you going to do with this?"
"I haven't heard of it."
"Do as I said."
"Do you know that?"
"I'm going to count to five."
"She is sleeping."
"Does he love you?"
"Neither."
"I told you so, man."
"She asked me to come."
"Whose daughter is she?"
"Nothing is happening here."
"I have tears in my eyes."
"It takes a little time."
"I have plans for you."
"We are men of our word."
"I was just waiting for the right moment."
"Isn't that always the case?"
"I'll call you from there."
"We have a man down."
"Do I have any?"
"I have to eat."
"There is a good reason."
"He's getting on my nerves."
"He will keep it all his life."
"I will take you to him."
"Why did you bring him here?"
"I would give my life for you."
"It's nice of you to do that."
"It's really not my thing."
"I thought everything was fine."
"Actually, I think so."
"I'm at the police station."
"I'll give you something."
"Do you have something to hide?"
"What about her?"
"She just needs time."
"Nobody asked you."
"The honeymoon is over."
"It's only been two weeks."
"I know you like me."
"It's great to see you again."
"It's just an expression."
"Only we are left."
"I didn't have the chance."
"Tonight is the party."
"I'll make it easy for you."
"What would you like?"
"What if you don't come back?"
"But you have to trust me."
"I talk to him however I want."
"Are you ready to go?"
"You have a choice to make."
"What kind of question is this?"
"We have to leave now."
"I learned to live with it."
"I knew you would be there."
"Have you ever seen this woman?"
"I was wondering when you would come."
"I have someone in mind."
"How did he find us?"
"I need to talk to my brother."
"Do you have an ID card?"
"I heard him say it."
"Please tell me."
"That's what he was doing."
"You get what you pay for."
"We have to go to school."
"Do you hear me?"
"So what can I do for you?"
"We'll see if it works."
"He asked me to dance."
"Are you asking me that?"
"We have work to do."
"We need to give it a name."
"They said where they were going?"
"I'm not parting with it."
"You were just a kid."
"He is ready to receive you."
"She did it herself."
"What were you hoping for?"
"What did you hope for?"
"She can't wait to see you."
"I keep telling him."
"I know where he is."
"What, what is it?"
"Don't drag me into this."
"It's just a book."
"I think I know."
"I almost called the police."
"I have some news for you."
"I think it's you."
"Of course we are."
"I saw her once."
"You're just a man."
"I will call you back as soon as possible."
"It's just a kiss."
"Do you love him that much?"
"She said she would come."
"I have to get you out of here."
"What are we going to do with her?"
"Everything is fine for now."
"I tried to contact you."
"Do you have anything else to say?"
"You will feel better tomorrow morning."
"And now we have two."
"What am I wearing?"
"She's on the other side."
"I say so."
"He was the one who called."
"I know you love it."
"All the honor is ours."
"Everyone does what they want."
"Guys, please."
"Jim, what's going on?"
"Who else is with you?"
"I'll get you a drink."
"What do you decide?"
"Do I know that?"
"Are you giving up?"
"We're going to have a good evening."
"What I've always done."
"I'm just a child."
"How should I tell you?"
"I knew you were coming."
"But he never came."
"Welcome to the big leagues."
"I think we found it."
"I want us to stay friends."
"Can you tell us more?"
"Can you tell us more?"
"Is this what you want?"
"Do you know what it's about?"
"I have to finish this first."
"I know you understand me."
"She was never found."
"She is never late."
"Yes, I heard that."
"I had a miscarriage."
"Wait, what's going on?"
"I came home."
"It just happened for you."
"You need to calm down."
"There is plenty of room."
"Do you want me to drive you?"
"No, I don't know them."
"Go see what he wants."
"It's a love letter."
"I'm going to explain something to you."
"Can you give us a moment?"
"Can you give us a minute?"
"I've never seen the ocean."
"I did this all by myself."
"Do you want me to call him?"
"No, you didn't understand."
"She's not mine."
"This is my gift to you."
"You're not ready yet."
"Here's how it's going to happen."
"Neither to me, nor to anyone."
"I'm going to do you a favor."
"I'll come as soon as I can."
"What are you looking at me for?"
"I know you were friends."
"From one second to the next."
"I'm going to talk to my boss."
"Thank you, that's kind of you."
"You look very good."
"Please, not now."
"The result will always be the same."
"I appreciate what you do."
"I like it when you do that."
"Everything I've done."
"And we always have been."
"What can I do for your service?"
"Do you know who you remind me of?"
"What can't you do?"
"I think we understand."
"Hello, who's speaking?"
"I'll get him out of there."
"He went through the window."
"You asked to see me."
"Tell her she's beautiful."
"How did you get this number?"
"Show me what you've got."
"There is one last thing."
"It was her idea."
"People don't want it."
"That's what it seems."
"This applies to you too."
"I knew I knew you."
"I have thought about your proposal."
"I heard about them."
"No, what's going on?"
"Salt pork is particularly tasty."
"These are the king's colors."
"Do you want me to follow you?"
"Because I believe in you."
"Don't talk to me about that."
"She slept all day."
"I'll call you back as soon as possible."
"Can it wait?"
"It was good to see you."
"Sooner or later, it had to happen."
"She's a friend of mine."
"I know he will."
"I'm at peace with that."
"This is my phone number."
"Tell me what I want."
"The horses keep him awake."
"It is a sign of respect."
"I am very grateful to you."
"These are not stories."
"She is not a child."
"It is written in the Bible."
"You don't want anything else?"
"I have to do it myself."
"You know how children are."
"Do you want to hold my hand?"
"Why did you do all this?"
"Glad we agree."
"Where do you think you're going like this?"
"You are a businessman."
"Didn't you hear her?"
"What do you expect from life?"
"I think you're finished."
"There are two more."
"I've never seen anything."
"Excuse me, I have something to do."
"I have a score to settle."
"What does it say?"
"I work for a living."
"Tell him I'm busy."
"I have never been so happy."
"I already explained it to you."
"I need your cooperation."
"I don't know, guys."
"What's going on?"
"What have you done for me?"
"I want to go to school."
"We are so close to the goal."
"I was expecting to see you."
"Do you think I'm interested?"
"I know where it is."
"Anyone can do this."
"I will do what you say."
"You look good."
"It's good, it's done."
"We need to talk about something."
"All right, I'll take care of it."
"Love is in the air."
"He's the one I love."
"You didn't ask me anything."
"Is it that important to you?"
"That was nice of you."
"That was kind of you."
"What can you tell me about it?"
"We need to talk to you."
"I have my theory on that."
"I have to ask him some questions."
"I think she's fine."
"What are they planning?"
"When were you going to tell me?"
"You didn't find it?"
"Tell me what you like."
"We're both fine."
"Do you remember what they tasted like?"
"You can't ask me that."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"You will be in the one at the end."
"My Indian daughter, my Indian daughter.."
"No, I didn't mean that."
"I was thinking about nothing else."
"Do what he asks you to do."
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"There is a small change."
"My memory is playing tricks on me."
"I have to get her out of there."
"Well, what do you think?"
"Are you responsible for this?"
"Did you know about that?"
"I'll take care of the girl."
"He worked all night."
"You must have some idea."
"You've already done enough."
"You've already done enough."
"We didn't touch anything."
"Where do you want us to go?"
"What do I take?"
"My hand is shaking."
"What are you doing in my bed?"
"I take care of my men."
"I will do what you say."
"I'll show you your rooms."
"Is it that good?"
"This is God's plan."
"What do we want?"
"I have memory lapses."
"Do you know what day it is?"
"And you, what's your name?"
"How do you know where I live?"
"There is a good chance."
"Are you the one who makes them?"
"What happened?"
"I have to explain to you."
"I forgot my wallet."
"Was it worth it?"
"What do you want it to be?"
"I just want to know."
"That's my stage name."
"Your brother was a big investment."
"I will see each of their faces."
"He is a beautiful little boy."
"I have thought about your offer."
"That's what I was."
"I am someone else."
"They know we're here."
"What would I look like?"
"But it went well."
"No one else knows."
"That's it, that's good."
"That's it, it's good."
"Do you want me to explain?"
"Did something happen?"
"I want you to love me."
"Come on, I have something to talk to you."
"Come, I have something to talk to you."
"I did it for love."
"I need to do this."
"I have to see this."
"Please believe me."
"Can I tell you something?"
"I wanted to talk to you about this."
"What is this place?"
"I am at your entire disposal."
"You're home now."
"I can go wherever I want."
"There is something for you."
"With milk and sugar?"
"But I know how to read a manual."
"Thank you for saving my son."
"The Ring is safe here."
"He said it himself."
"Do you want some of that?"
"I need a researcher."
"You can thank me later."
"I didn't ask you."
"I think it's me."
"What are you going to do with her?"
"OK, what's going on?"
"I never thought so."
"I hope you know that."
"I see what you mean."
"Do you know who you look like?"
"What's on your mind?"
"You are stronger than me."
"I'll keep that in mind."
"What did you do with her?"
"My feelings haven't changed."
"We're all going to get involved."
"But what's my head?"
"This is our way out."
"What are you going to do there?"
"Have you heard about me?"
"Take what you need."
"What do you imagine?"
"You have very beautiful eyes."
"What's going on, Sergeant?"
"Call me when it's done."
"Call me when it's done."
"I would like to say goodbye to him."
"You don't understand English?"
"You're not sure?"
"I'm having a great time."
"Do you agree with me?"
"I saw you looking at me."
"Everything went as planned."
"You have to take care of yourself."
"You can't defeat him."
"You are not a woman."
"I might know someone."
"I should go there."
"Maybe you should call him."
"I remember it very well."
"When were you planning to tell me about it?"
"There is nothing anyone can do about it."
"Don't apologize for me."
"I have read all of his books."
"I took it for you."
"I have a job for you."
"I really have to go now."
"Do you think what I think?"
"That's very kind of you."
"She means nothing to me."
"Leave them out of it."
"It's true, I swear."
"It's just a name."
"What are you missing?"
"I want to come home."
"I want you to stay here."
"She is not one of us."
"What do you want to do later?"
"We will do our best."
"Let's hope it doesn't come to that."
"I still need you."
"You have to see it."
"You make me want to throw up."
"There is a better way."
"Do you know what awaits us?"
"I have a decision to make."
"All because of you."
"No need to get to that point."
"Let me take a look at it."
"Go see what he's doing."
"God has nothing to do with it."
"I think it worked."
"We have to find them."
"That's right, he's right."
"It's a gift from heaven."
"I was in high school with him."
"You were there for me."
"What else did you find?"
"I ask you."
"She needs a lawyer."
"It's out of reach now."
"It's just a hobby."
"You still don't understand?"
"Tell me I'm beautiful."
"I'm not hungry yet."
"I did it for them."
"I wanted to surprise him."
"I didn't recognize him."
"I'm a little busy right now."
"That's why I came."
"Because it's the law."
"Did you work all night?"
"I hope you are happy."
"Are you ready to do it?"
"Are you ready to do it?"
"I just wanted to be with you."
"I'll be here when you get back."
"How was your evening?"
"Your place is by my side."
"It's true, I assure you."
"Can you give us a moment?"
"That's what they said."
"You do it every time."
"I think I love you."
"Please go ahead."
"What are we missing?"
"What do you have in your hand?"
"And you, what do you think?"
"I will take care of it personally."
"I'll meet you in the car."
"I have someone for you."
"Where were you the night before last?"
"Thank you for letting me come."
"Have you ever heard of it?"
"Have you ever heard of it?"
"No, I can't take it anymore."
"He didn't tell you?"
"I just did my job."
"It's me you love."
"And the rest of the team?"
"It was about time you arrived."
"How do you plan to do this?"
"Who gave you the order?"
"It has to be done."
"Thank you for receiving us so quickly."
"I need my car."
"I need all of this."
"Did you see someone passing by?"
"You don't believe in God?"
"What else have you done?"
"You know how women are."
"I went for a walk."
"You should take a look at it."
"I'll tell you."
"But I need him."
"Look what they did."
"He's someone important."
"It's time to talk."
"I always trusted you."
"I'm taking him to the infirmary."
"I feel it in the earth."
"I had something else in mind."
"Who is the chief's daughter dating?"
"I see it, I see it."
"I'm glad to have you."
"Yes, I was told that."
"I have one thing to say."
"I just need some air."
"He knows what it is."
"And how do you plan to do that?"
"We have to get this over with."
"A cognac, please."
"You should be proud of yourself."
"I already told him."
"We have less than an hour."
"You are."
"I brought you a coffee."
"Then what happened?"
"I will never tell you."
"There must be a reason."
"I did this once."
"You shouldn't go there."
"You'll have that on your conscience."
"I know the rules of the game."
"Night flights are prohibited."
"There is little hope."
"It's just an idea."
"Do you want to go out together?"
"Eat while it's hot."
"You asked me to come."
"The sooner the better."
"Who wants to go first?"
"Think about what you are doing."
"Anyway, it's over."
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"You know what's going to happen."
"I like being with you."
"Can I come in?"
"There are lots of people."
"I will, I will."
"It's the other way around."
"What if it doesn't work?"
"A place on the last boat."
"The best time of my life."
"Can we talk about this later?"
"That's the most important thing."
"She moved on."
"We'll get it next time."
"We've been here for an hour."
"I offer you my condolences."
"No sex before marriage."
"Please stay calm."
"What else are you hiding from me?"
"There is no question of that."
"They are just objects."
"I slipped in the shower."
"This is a golden opportunity."
"I can do magic."
"What do I wear?"
"And what did you say to him?"
"That's what's beautiful."
"I'll be here all week."
"I gave you life."
"I did anything."
"No, I'm going home."
"It's such a beautiful day."
"You didn't ask me."
"It's okay, he's gone."
"You lived up to it."
"I don't know him personally."
"Can I buy you a drink?"
"I'm going to teach you a lesson."
"No question of talking about that."
"Do you feel it?"
"Not now, please."
"Of course I'm happy."
"You must be able to do something."
"I think you'll like it."
"Exactly what we need."
"What were you waiting for?"
"Everyone is so nice."
"I saw you talking to him."
"Whether we like it or not."
"I would like to speak to my brother."
"I went to see a shrink."
"It's my trademark."
"Do you think it worked?"
"Please take a seat."
"When is the big day?"
"It's the law of the market."
"What do they know?"
"I was there, remember?"
"You've had it long enough."
"I am the night watchman."
"Feel the strength of his legs."
"It will only take a few minutes."
"I am something else."
"Do you see what you're doing?"
"She's not a witch."
"You called me about that?"
"Since when has he been like this?"
"I can do this on my own."
"Don't you want to relax?"
"I'm doing this for your own good."
"I've never seen you."
"She prefers plants to people."
"How did you find me here?"
"He did what he wanted."
"I did it all by myself."
"You are really lucky."
"See you after class."
"What's going on behind?"
"Just take me home."
"She would never have done that."
"I don't love you."
"It's so much more than that."
"It all started with the Great Rings."
"Do you know what that means?"
"What if you don't come back?"
"It's good to hear from you."
"What would you like?"
"This is my daughter."
"You did a great job."
"I can't really say."
"The Black Gate is very close."
"I'm going to the other side."
"You're going to wake everyone up."
"I'll be back in a little while."
"I know how to talk to people."
"You don't know a lot."
"You know what would be awesome?"
"Do you want me to open it?"
"We are on the right track."
"I stay out of it."
"I put them in water."
"Do you know why we're here?"
"The secondary belt is also load-bearing."
"Yes, that's a bit like it."
"That's very generous of you."
"It will be a breeze."
"That might be a good idea."
"You are the guest of honor."
"Don't just think about yourself."
"Please follow me."
"I called you last night."
"I won."
"What can we do for you?"
"It was last minute."
"I think you know each other."
"Is everything okay between you two?"
"It's the end of the month."
"A secondary belt and an inner one."
"I wish you to be happy."
"We'll see then."
"I'll put you on speakerphone."
"Of course I'm interested."
"Where do you think you're going like this?"
"I'm tired of talking."
"Did you do biology?"
"I never wrote that."
"I'll get us some coffee."
"They are all around us."
"You would be doing me a great favor."
"You don't remember anything?"
"You're safer here."
"I already called the police."
"Should I get on my knees?"
"I need to know where he is."
"I wish she were here."
"You are very sure of yourself."
"Put it on speaker."
"Just what we need."
"What did you do before the war?"
"I thought it was done."
"That's what she thinks."
"And how long will it take?"
"You're going to get one."
"I'm on a business trip."
"We have it in our bones."
"This is just my opinion."
"It's good for circulation."
"Do you have somewhere to go?"
"Can you do it or not?"
"I'll meet you at the car."
"You said it was important."
"It's worth what it's worth."
"And where does that come from?"
"Okay, you win."
"We both were."
"Who gave you permission?"
"That's what we hoped for."
"Don't you have any idea?"
"She's not afraid of anything."
"Go ahead, please."
"Its goal: to prevent another war."
"I have no opinion."
"Moonlight at noon?"
"I feel a draft."
"What I do best."
"The first round will be for me."
"I saw his true face."
"On the other side of the bridge."
"He is on the other side."
"No, I didn't notice."
"Tell him what you think."
"Beautiful morning, isn't it?"
"I want to become a normal being again."
"Do you have it?"
"Gallop, show us your speed."
"I'll be there in five minutes."
"He's gone for good."
"Who knows what they want?"
"I'll give you one last chance."
"You took me by surprise."
"This is my idea."
"But there are laws."
"What did you do?"
"I spoke to the police."
"It was stronger than him."
"I can't find it."
"What if there were deaths?"
"There were many."
"I did everything for you."
"So how does she know?"
"You need someone."
"She didn't tell me."
"I have to think about the future."
"You know what we want."
"Is everyone in position?"
"That's what I'm here for, right?"
"Do you like it?"
"I know how to do it."
"I have one too."
"You've never been married?"
"I just told the truth."
"What do you bet?"
"That's it, you're right."
"I left you a note."
"Are you a girl or what?"
"No need to apologize."
"I think it's important."
"I saw it first."
"Go get him some water."
"I have to keep busy."
"I walked out the door."
"This is actually a good thing."
"Are you serious?"
"I'll go take a look."
"Thank you for having me come."
"Have you ever seen this guy?"
"I think it's cute."
"What else can you do?"
"This is where it all begins."
"Do you understand that?"
"That's all that was left."
"Is there anything?"
"Ready for firing."
"It looks very good."
"I saw you kissing him."
"See you in a few days."
"Will the Ring be safe there?"
"I can't allow this."
"I thought he loved me."
"Anytime, anywhere."
"It's wonderful to see you."
"Give us a hand."
"Nina, what's going on?"
"What did you do last night?"
"So see you later."
"Do you want to come home?"
"But he did nothing."
"Tell the other clans to come."
"Because it is one."
"No need to say it."
"What if I get caught?"
"He asked to see you."
"As far as I know, yes."
"You have things to do."
"It's so important to me."
"How could you say that?"
"Bring me one of those chickens."
"Did he take drugs?"
"What's going on, Mom?"
"We have the house to ourselves."
"But I found some bacon."
"Did you have a good trip?"
"It is up to His Eminence to decide."
"What's stopping you?"
"She knows we are here."
"I made one for myself."
"I am one of the highest paid."
"I need to speak to your father."
"Thank you for seeing me so quickly."
"Nobody told you?"
"I haven't heard anything."
"What do you want to do?"
"I had a wonderful evening."
"Glad you could come."
"I should have stopped him."
"But I needed a partner."
"Calm down, please."
"We have the night ahead of us."
"Do you want me to talk to him?"
"You know I'm innocent."
"She needs her father."
"I swear on my mother."
"Did someone say something?"
"How dare you make this decision?"
"How did she do that?"
"I want you to look at me."
"How long do you need?"
"Do you know anything about him?"
"What is it, madam?"
"No, you don't have it."
"He is in serious condition."
"I made you some tea."
"In your hip, under the skin."
"How long will you last here?"
"What if he doesn't want to?"
"Isn't life beautiful?"
"She wasn't like that."
"Please say yes."
"Where did you get this?"
"We'll go to New Orleans."
"Can I have a word with you?"
"Do you like me?"
"I just need to know."
"I know you have it."
"And you, what are you going to do?"
"You know how people are."
"You've already done enough."
"I just can't."
"I told him about us."
"They both were."
"He came home."
"See what you have done."
"She was there just now."
"Did you get the mega-info?"
"Do you see her?"
"I could say the same thing."
"And it never will be."
"No one else does."
"You know what they say?"
"What else could it be?"
"I will never see her again."
"How can you not know?"
"She jumped off a bridge."
"I need permission."
"That's how we met."
"Got something in mind?"
"And you can choose a woman."
"That will do more for me."
"Do you want me to calm down?"
"You're taking a shuttle again this evening."
"I expected something else."
"I got your file, Corporal."
"That means it works."
"Do you remember all that?"
"I have to go."
"She slit her wrists."
"Where did he come from?"
"It could be anyone."
"I'll take care of the paperwork."
"No, I wouldn't do that."
"I thought you might want to know."
"But you have to tell him first."
"Yes, something like that."
"He had something to do."
"What shocks you?"
"It's part of my charm."
"It's probably for the best."
"How are you so sure?"
"Where did you think it was?"
"I see you inside."
"Can't you understand that?"
"Be careful what you do."
"I want to do this for you."
"Do I need a reason?"
"I didn't even touch her."
"It's a family trait."
"One word, please."
"I brought you some wine."
"There is still a chance."
"That's music."
"He knows what he's saying."
"I wanted to speak to you privately."
"I hope I never see you again."
"I am the one you are looking for."
"We are in the same class."
"Maybe it's a coincidence."
"Could we talk about something else?"
"The next one will be your last, little one."
"Nobody knows who he is."
"We'll see what happens."
"I read his mind."
"When you want, where you want."
"It's time for dessert."
"They are ready to receive you."
"This is what we can do."
"My God, I beg you."
"Don't like sex?"
"I thought you forgot."
"Who do you think I am?"
"Tell him it's me."
"It's a very beautiful story."
"All we need."
"You should see the other guy."
"I had to see you."
"Do you know whose it is?"
"He knows what's going on."
"Who did you sell it to?"
"Of course he's there."
"Here we go."
"Do you have any brothers or sisters?"
"There are still plenty of them."
"I brought you something."
"What big teeth you have."
"Don't give me orders."
"How are you going to get through this?"
"I speak from experience."
"I would like to ask him a few questions."
"Someone should say something."
"What's going on?"
"Let's hope it doesn't come to anything."
"Do you hear it, near the barbed wire?"
"I'll transfer them to your account."
"I can defend myself."
"I'll count to ten."
"Mom, what happened?"
"And that is the truth."
"Can you tell me your name?"
"What do I have left?"
"Can I ask you some questions?"
"Show him some respect."
"Please believe me."
"I'm glad to be here."
"I'm glad you called."
"Why did you do that to him?"
"Thank you for coming with me."
"Do you know what you are saying?"
"Let me open the door for you."
"I did a good job."
"I'm fine, I assure you."
"What do you think I do?"
"You never told me that."
"I want to go back to school."
"I've never seen this before."
"Give me your phone number."
"He's heading straight for us."
"Tell him I'm looking for him."
"A way to leave the island."
"So what happened?"
"You can go anywhere."
"Which is a good thing."
"I don't have any."
"No, I have to go home."
"What kind of man are you?"
"Would you like some water?"
"You didn't even look."
"I know this kind of man."
"Listen to what I'm telling you."
"Please follow me."
"You are always there for me."
"How are we going to find him?"
"I want an ice cream."
"Is that what you thought?"
"You knew it from the start."
"Let him go, did you hear me?"
"No, I never said that."
"I want to move forward."
"Do you know where he might be?"
"I have my feet on the ground."
"You didn't go there?"
"We are in the same camp."
"What do you want me to say?"
"That's a bit like it, yes."
"It's going to be a good day."
"I needed to talk to you."
"Tell him I'll call him back."
"Tell him I'll call him back."
"Aren't you letting me in?"
"Tell him I'm fine."
"My father taught me that."
"I can always count on you."
"Everything will be fine now."
"You have a very beautiful voice."
"Do you want to make money?"
"We will send them a message."
"Do you have anything to eat?"
"No, it's fine, everything's fine."
"You are stronger than me."
"This is an opportunity to be seized."
"Can I borrow your phone?"
"We got what we wanted."
"I barely touched you."
"What did she mean?"
"It just happened for you."
"They are not the same."
"I brought you a present."
"It's written all over your face."
"You can trust me."
"Do you want to listen to music?"
"We have a lot of good women."
"She has a message for you."
"I already told you."
"I spent my life here."
"Give him a hand."
"Nobody knows where we are."
"Do you know his last name?"
"Maybe later."
"I need to get a makeover."
"This is what happened to me."
"He did it for you."
"I needed to hear it."
"She did well."
"There are other places."
"And it's been going on for years."
"See you at training."
"Do you think I like it?"
"What are you doing?"
"Tell them what's going on."
"I know you know him."
"How do you know where I live?"
"I'll do it next time."
"I forgot to turn it off."
"It's a very beautiful house."
"No, you're not listening to me."
"He offered me a drink."
"No, I didn't do that."
"Have you brushed your teeth?"
"Do you see me?"
"Like a letter in the mail."
"See you at the hospital."
"I am one of you."
"It can be anyone."
"Yes, you are probably right."
"Your wife is still online."
"See the world we come from."
"I know they are there."
"What's next?"
"You have a sharp tongue."
"I will take good care of you."
"Nothing was done to you."
"I'm the only one left."
"Because I am one."
"I heard about your mother."
"But it never happened."
"I thought you were."
"Have you spoken to your wife?"
"Have you spoken to your wife?"
"What does that make you think of?"
"What were you doing on the lake?"
"I would like a glass of water."
"I have one too."
"Will he come back?"
"It's only been a few days."
"They say it's important."
"You know what I'm saying?"
"Give him a glass of water."
"You are part of the team."
"It's a school night."
"I trust your judgment."
"Do you know where they went?"
"No, he doesn't know."
"What's his real name?"
"I need to relax."
"I'm going to do you a favor."
"I have worked with him before."
"Do you understand what's going on?"
"I want to know everything about you."
"Come here, please."
"There must be a connection."
"What do your elf eyes see?"
"He is a handsome young man."
"You love a shadow, a thought."
"What's so wonderful about it?"
"I want to believe you."
"Didn't you hear me?"
"Please do it."
"It's a fairy tale."
"I've never seen him."
"We are happy to welcome you."
"I never had a choice."
"I love you, Sugar Bunny."
"This is far from enough."
"It's human nature."
"I hope it's good."
"No, he wouldn't do that."
"I want to go there."
"I spoke to you on the phone."
"Well, what do you say?"
"It has to be me."
"I'm glad to meet you."
"We need strong people."
"I knew you'd like it."
"How many drinks did you have?"
"I came to talk to you."
"I eat what I want."
"We appreciate your volunteering."
"I just do it."
"What's in this bag?"
"Let me take you home."
"Were there any injuries?"
"He led us here."
"How can you be sure?"
"How did you get my picture?"
"I need my bag."
"Have you ever seen this man?"
"Fly as fast as the winds."
"What kind of father are you?"
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"I always wanted to be a doctor."
"You know where you hope to go."
"I had some things to take care of."
"It won't be long, I promise."
"You owe me at least that much."
"How did you get past the guards?"
"You say what you think."
"I don't really think about it."
"I know you love me."
"She left this for you."
"She can't help it."
"What should I expect?"
"I'll use the gas first."
"What if someone sees us?"
"Seeds from the Sacred Tree."
"What's going on in there?"
"I'm not going to call him."
"I often thought of you."
"What if he doesn't make it?"
"Someone else was there."
"For the sake of my family."
"I've always wanted to meet you."
"He says he's fine."
"You know you love me."
"You did a great job."
"Nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you."
"He only thinks of himself."
"I see who you're talking about."
"Go through the area with a fine-tooth comb."
"Please stand up."
"I just wanted to say goodnight."
"You are on the right track."
"That's good stuff, huh?"
"Can I ask you some questions?"
"You've had a long day."
"From my wife."
"Are there still many?"
"There is a door behind."
"I don't take drugs."
"Maybe he'll listen to you."
"What's on your mind?"
"What more can I say?"
"Do you see what it is?"
"At this time of night?"
"What if he can't?"
"That's it for this time."
"I just received a message."
"But there is one thing."
"I cut my hand."
"One second, please."
"It's you I'm looking for."
"He needs a lesson."
"He can manage on his own."
"I have family there."
"I'll do it, this eight."
"Go see what it is."
"I don't see her anywhere."
"I owe you money."
"It's up to you."
"Here, this will do you good."
"At nightfall."
"Have you never been there?"
"Do you see where I am?"
"There will be change."
"It will do us good."
"It's a question of will."
"You are a very beautiful woman."
"Is this where you work?"
"No, she won't."
"I think I'm going to throw up."
"Do you think they'll come?"
"This is the end of the journey."
"Do you know who this man is?"
"He needs to rest."
"That's what they do."
"I thought I heard a noise."
"Now, while it's fresh."
"What else about the structure?"
"We will be more comfortable."
"Do you love me that much?"
"I have one for you."
"Can I offer you a coffee?"
"What are you doing in my house?"
"He is a very interesting person."
"I guess you're right."
"There might be something."
"Have you ever seen one?"
"You're a big boy now."
"Because it won't happen."
"It's good for the skin."
"You say you want to protect your own?"
"Who do you take me for?"
"I had never seen them."
"How did you get this number?"
"That's what we want."
"Do you want me to go see?"
"I owe him at least that much."
"I just asked a question."
"Did he talk to anyone?"
"Do you understand what he's saying?"
"Would you like some tea?"
"I'll see how she is."
"Did someone call the police?"
"And I know you do too."
"This is one for me."
"Do you remember our conversation?"
"I wish you a good trip."
"Whose car is this?"
"I'm just looking at you."
"It's just a date."
"Why did he say that?"
"Shall we get laid?"
"In the middle of the night?"
"You are in a restricted area."
"I told you to come."
"Well, that's a relief."
"Yes, I heard that."
"That's a lot of money."
"You're the one talking about it."
"I have read all your books."
"Nobody ever says anything to me."
"I have to tell you something else."
"I kept calling."
"What if something happens to you?"
"What if we went there?"
"I asked you to come."
"Is this an empathy test?"
"I am a man of the people."
"Is he a relative of yours?"
"I'll be there in a few minutes."
"I've never felt so good."
"Can I ask you some questions?"
"Tell him I called."
"What do you imagine?"
"Promise me you'll train the boy."
"What time did he leave?"
"I was just a child."
"What do you say about these shrimps?"
"Say hello to your father for me."
"That's his way of doing things."
"What's in the box?"
"You can have whoever you want."
"I'll be there in a second."
"Not as far as you're concerned."
"Milk, please."
"I know it's me."
"Do you want something to eat?"
"Family is family."
"I'm just saying it."
"The back door is open."
"It might do you some good."
"We'll do just fine."
"I asked you to leave."
"All day, every day."
"What's the point of all this?"
"You don't know his name?"
"Sorry, I have to take this call."
"I expected nothing less."
"Do you want to go eat something?"
"I thought I heard something."
"You need a drink."
"This must be stopped."
"This is my gift to you."
"Think about what you say."
"This is the case for all of us."
"You've never been married."
"Where is the horn that blew?"
"My son needs me."
"I think so."
"I have to go take a shower."
"I didn't call them."
"It's a nice little blade."
"I hope to hear from you."
"I think we got it."
"This applies to you too."
"Where is Sally's passport?"
"You can always count on me."
"You can always count on me."
"Why do you say that like that?"
"I am open to any suggestions."
"Can I talk to you for two seconds?"
"I have a package for you."
"Someone is going to pay for this."
"He knows I'm here."
"A little while ago."
"What do I answer?"
"What is this bin?"
"I need to know everything."
"You're going to need me."
"Is this what you were waiting for?"
"What is your point of view?"
"It's a collector's car."
"Can I see you for a moment?"
"Have you been here before, Chief?"
"You have the right to a lawyer."
"You just did it."
"My father was in the army."
"I'll even do it for you."
"You know, don't you?"
"I have something to take care of."
"He says he is innocent."
"I'm proud of you, darling."
"I settled the score with him."
"How did the hearing go?"
"How did the audition go?"
"I never asked you anything."
"I'll manage on my own."
"I'm going to get myself a drink."
"It shows in your eyes."
"The afternoon essentials."
"Glad to hear you say that."
"Please wake up."
"I know where you're coming from."
"I had a great evening."
"You know how women are."
"Glad to see you looking good."
"I have a reputation to maintain."
"No, she's not here."
"I have some on my hand."
"We made you a cake."
"He shook my hand."
"What are you looking at?"
"What do you give me in return?"
"I'll tell him to call you."
"They are pieces of wood."
"No safe places around here."
"I wrote it myself."
"Are you out of the hospital?"
"We're going to have a good time."
"You will have what you want."
"Nothing is left to chance."
"When were you going to tell me?"
"I know you like it."
"Maybe we should go home."
"Do this in memory of me."
"What will he do with it?"
"I have experienced it."
"Thank you for coming in such large numbers."
"Is it time to go?"
"It was clear as day."
"Is there any beer?"
"I'm going to stay here for a while."
"She just told me."
"My father always told me that."
"It's nice to see you."
"Was it noticeable?"
"He seems very nice."
"How long before the explosion?"
"We'll see more clearly tomorrow."
"I'm looking for a friend of mine."
"You don't want to talk about it?"
"Does he know?"
"I thought you might be interested."
"I knew what to expect."
"I am in the same situation."
"You are stronger than us."
"I have to go back to the hotel."
"I'll be there for dinner."
"With everything you need."
"Why are you telling me this now?"
"What were they looking for?"
"Have fun at school."
"It's good for the heart."
"What do we see?"
"Do you want it to be me?"
"I need to sort this out."
"This is what you are looking for."
"I understood the lesson well."
"I am very proud of him."
"Have you ever seen this gentleman?"
"They made me listen to it."
"No, no, you don't understand."
"Where does he live?"
"It was just a question."
"We are what we are."
"I'll meet you at the car."
"Is that who I think it is?"
"Don't get too attached to it."
"I am a man of faith."
"I have a plan for you."
"But I had an idea."
"Everyone has a story."
"Caught red-handed."
"I see red paint."
"I tried to reason with you."
"I'll give you a chance."
"Who gave you this idea?"
"It's going to be great."
"How do you expect me to know?"
"How do you want me to know?"
"You need to talk to him."
"We have something to do."
"There is still work to be done."
"I said I would come."
"I have what you are looking for."
"Your mother needs you."
"I am very grateful to you."
"It makes things more interesting."
"I'm trying to do my job."
"I'll be there in an hour."
"There are days like that."
"My father told me about it."
"Thank you very much for inviting me."
"Nice to have you join us."
"I put myself in your place."
"Thank you for letting me come."
"I think she's fine."
"You get what you want."
"I hope you get it."
"You still have a lot to learn."
"I'll tell you what to do."
"I will pay whatever it takes."
"Because I can do it."
"I have the access card."
"Can I take you home?"
"You have something in common."
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"There is a secret passage."
"There is a man here."
"We still have a lot of work to do."
"He never touched me."
"He never touched me."
"He knows you love him."
"I am only the intermediary."
"You're very lucky."
"Who do you want me to be?"
"He had to leave town."
"Is that what you're suggesting?"
"You will do better next time."
"You'll do better next time."
"It's good for my back."
"Look what we have here."
"I wish you a pleasant stay."
"That's what they're looking for."
"I love him, that's all."
"It shows on your face."
"I never want to see you again."
"It shows on his face."
"Thank you for taking care of me."
"How do you want me to do it?"
"I brought you something."
"I'll call you when we arrive."
"Look what they did."
"Of course I was."
"Don't you think she's good?"
"Is this where you live?"
"What's going on?"
"Let's see what you can do."
"She will take care of you."
"What are you trying to tell me?"
"I'm done with her."
"Did you understand?"
"I sent you a picture."
"I wanted you to see this."
"You don't owe anything at all."
"Outside the city."
"That's my artist name."
"I'll get rid of them."
"Do you have any Panama Red?"
"I'll do it myself."
"The Special Victims Unit."
"I've never played it."
"How did you get on?"
"No, I completely understand."
"I'll give you one."
"I have something to check."
"I am sleeping."
"I know who you're talking about."
"Do we flip a coin?"
"This is the end of the press release."
"What does he hope for?"
"Did he show you his license plate?"
"We have something for you."
"Your psychiatrist told me about it."
"He must have had a good reason."
"Can you tell me more?"
"Who is responsible for all this?"
"What are you holding?"
"She won't change her mind."
"He's pretty good, you know?"
"On my mother's grave."
"Not if you're a genius."
"See you when I get back."
"I have to go shopping."
"I should have remembered."
"Do you want to leave him a message?"
"You have to tell him."
"Of course you're fine."
"Tell us what you see."
"I think I know who it is."
"No, I don't accept it."
"He knows you're there."
"Haven't we met before?"
"You'll never get out of here."
"I have a scoop for you."
"You look good."
"Before I change my mind."
"I ask you to forgive me."
"Where did you learn to dance?"
"Maybe I can fix that."
"What about us?"
"I know what he's saying."
"To go from here to Venus?"
"Do you need a minute?"
"Because I like you."
"How many can there be?"
"Do you know what that means?"
"I'll show you to your room."
"I slept on the plane."
"What remains to be done?"
"I thought you might be interested."
"Thanks for letting me know."
"What did he promise you?"
"You'll tell me about it."
"This is God's will."
"I bought you flowers."
"Did you have a good holiday?"
"It means a lot to me."
"Because I am a man."
"I guess you're right."
"Please forgive me."
"Do you know what it looks like?"
"No tea with that one."
"I have to pick up my children."
"I have what you wanted."
"I just remembered."
"There is always a way out."
"What do you think you are doing?"
"Give me a hand."
"I'll tell them the truth."
"What will they do?"
"It's my mother's."
"Your ticket please."
"Yes, I told you."
"Yes, I told you."
"I have a guest room."
"No, that's fine."
"It's like I told you."
"Of course I will."
"I've never read it."
"What kind of man are you?"
"On earth as it is in heaven."
"As you told me."
"I would have come anyway."
"It's not the same anymore."
"Do you know why you're here?"
"We need to question him."
"Did you spend the night here?"
"He'll get us out of here."
"Why do you take it like that?"
"I bet it's him."
"You must know something."
"Did you buy me a gift?"
"I'll do it alone."
"At the end of the corridor on the left."
"It's his lucky day."
"Maybe she'll change her mind."
"I'd rather not say it."
"Of course you can."
"Do you have a picture of her?"
"I fought for you."
"I don't really remember."
"That's absolutely out of the question."
"It's bedtime."
"I had never heard of it."
"It's good, we've got it."
"He is still in the hospital."
"How are you doing, everyone?"
"It's just a finger."
"Looks like you were right."
"Have you heard of her?"
"Sounds great to me."
"I knew you would be."
"We have to take care of this."
"But someone did."
"It's a very interesting story."
"Do you know what they call me?"
"Yes, what happened?"
"I am delighted to meet you."
"I am delighted to meet you."
"What was going on?"
"I think about you all the time."
"I wanted to tell you something."
"I wanted to tell you something."
"But there are exceptions."
"You're an hour late."
"I'm on a big case."
"I'll give it back to you later."
"Everyone liked him."
"What am I supposed to do with it?"
"I was one of them."
"This is my favorite."
"What are you two doing?"
"He must have a good reason."
"Thank you for thinking of us."
"Who gave the green light?"
"Do you have a flashlight?"
"I think he's fine."
"Do you want to know where she is?"
"He seemed so nice."
"Tell me what you're looking for."
"I don't want an argument."
"I've come to terms with it."
"My God, what happened?"
"I had never been here."
"I need the part."
"No, I really can't."
"You must have a lot of questions."
"I'm just curious, that's all."
"I know what it's called."
"I think I hear it."
"Can we talk for a moment?"
"You can come back whenever you want."
"She didn't drown."
"I'm going anyway."
"This is my father."
"I'll see you again in a few days."
"As long as it takes."
"It's beyond our jurisdiction."
"I have some calls to make."
"Your face looks familiar."
"I came to see you."
"What do you have in your bag?"
"Do you want me to take you back?"
"I'll give it to you later."
"I have a wife and children."
"It's okay, she's gone."
"Didn't they tell you?"
"Please stay here."
"Is it that important to you?"
"I want to do it with you."
"Did you tell Dad?"
"What if we went together?"
"You should have said something."
"It's the thought that counts."
"What did you want me to say?"
"Yes, there is something."
"Look where that got you."
"I think we should talk."
"He killed himself."
"The Force is strong in him."
"I never wanted this."
"In this case, it's easy."
"You heard me perfectly."
"What's gone?"
"Have you ever thought about that?"
"Guess what I did."
"I think I'll leave."
"I'll make things easier for you."
"It's not yours."
"Can I go with you?"
"I need some information."
"Do you do this every day?"
"The security system plan?"
"It's my birth, after all."
"How did you get my number?"
"No, you don't think so."
"He wanted you to have it."
"There was shooting."
"I just told him."
"Do you want to tell me something?"
"It's nice to meet you."
"I imagine it's possible."
"Love, love, love."
"It does honor to your species."
"I'll wait for you at the car."
"Who do you want it to be?"
"Let's take a look."
"I can't tell him that."
"It's probably better that way."
"The time for change has come."
"It's like last time."
"Do you think it's serious?"
"You must tell me the truth."
"I think that says it all."
"I want to kiss you."
"I want to go all the way."
"He must have been quite a man."
"What do you know about him?"
"Your father's lightsaber."
"May I know who you are?"
"I would have liked to do much more."
"How much time do you have left?"
"How much time do you have left?"
"We live in the same city."
"I have two words for you."
"To see what it is."
"Tell him it's over."
"A password is required."
"I don't know the code."
"I'll let them know we're there."
"Have you always been like this?"
"The celebration of the king's coronation."
"It's a girl thing."
"We have to move on."
"Do you know where the others are?"
"Who will take care of him?"
"You'll never be that skilled."
"I know how to use it."
"He is the one who is."
"You can't trust him."
"I need a break."
"Do you want to come, honey?"
"You made fun of me."
"It was a very good idea."
"What's she up to?"
"Who will take care of me?"
"Who else saw this?"
"Don't be shy about us."
"We have so much to say to each other."
"I need him here."
"Please excuse me for interrupting you."
"It's beginner's luck."
"What does she believe?"
"Do you think you live in the future?"
"Sorry I scared you."
"Actually, I have a question."
"Close the door, please."
"I thought it was tomorrow."
"Thank you for your time."
"Lock the base of the western pillars."
"No, no, it's nothing."
"There are electrical disturbances."
"It's good to see you again."
"What amuses you?"
"This applies to you too."
"If you would be so kind as to sign here."
"He has been following us for three days."
"I need to contact James."
"I love you too, Dad."
"What's going on, Captain?"
"I actually wanted to talk to you about it."
"Have you had breakfast?"
"I relieve you of your command."
"Do not drink and drive."
"I will take care of them."
"Ask him what he wants."
"What do you have in your hand?"
"I'll be there in a minute."
"I jump into the water."
"Tell me how you feel."
"About an hour ago."
"I really had fun."
"I have some in my bag."
"But what is he talking about?"
"That's what she would like."
"Take care of him for me."
"It's not worth it."
"What does he need?"
"I had a great day."
"I wanted to tell you the truth."
"Who do you think I am?"
"Please hurry up."
"Young people don't like light ones?"
"I know what he likes."
"Okay, see you later."
"Answer me, please."
"Not from my department, of course."
"I need an office."
"I want to get out of here."
"What's in the bag?"
"Everyone is welcome."
"It's a battlefield."
"You must leave her, my brother."
"I hope so anyway."
"Can I ask you something?"
"Don't you want to see her?"
"I do what I have to."
"No, I won't leave you."
"I thought you left."
"Thank you for what you do."
"Two more, please."
"I want to feel you inside me."
"Because he's my father."
"Could we talk about it later?"
"Sophie, what happened?"
"Do you think I am?"
"I was listening."
"One, two, three, here we go."
"You've never done this?"
"I can smell it on you."
"That's what I felt."
"Where do you think you are going?"
"I need a partner."
"This is excellent work."
"I'll manage on my own."
"I'll go there and come back."
"Your face looks familiar."
"Let me buy you a drink."
"It's a matter of loyalty."
"What do you think it is?"
"It's just for a week."
"You can talk to me, you know."
"We'll see when we get there."
"You haven't seen her again?"
"She didn't call me back."
"That's good for the five of us."
"Of course it's you."
"I will try to be clear."
"They must be inside."
"Until I come back."
"There was an argument."
"I know things about you."
"It went really well."
"I can't do anything more."
"I can't do anything more."
"That's what's great."
"I need to see you again."
"I know it was her."
"I know why you came."
"Or anything else."
"Thank God you're back."
"You're going to pierce my skin."
"Anywhere in the world."
"Do you know where she is?"
"We split the difference."
"There must be an answer."
"Tonight it's my round."
"Sorry to put you through this."
"She didn't call me."
"How can you trust him?"
"I've seen it before."
"Of course it will work."
"Autopilot takes us there."
"What's going on, Inspector?"
"I'll try to find her."
"I have to tell you something."
"Do you want some wine?"
"This is private property."
"Is this your first time here?"
"What did you come here for?"
"What is your name, my boy?"
"Don't you want to see it?"
"Not long ago."
"What must you think of me?"
"He has something for me."
"Honey, it's a long story."
"Do you think you're a star?"
"I'm going in the opposite direction."
"There are other possibilities."
"I was just a kid."
"I love you, I miss you."
"No, I need you."
"Now there are two."
"Absolutely, absolutely."
"What is he carrying?"
"They will elect a new chancellor."
"Glad you liked it."
"And I advise you to accept."
"What do you think it is?"
"Sounds like it to me."
"What will happen next?"
"Let me return the favor."
"What are you doing up so early?"
"Repeat what you said."
"Don't you have another one?"
"I'll make some calls."
"I know she is."
"I didn't believe it."
"What do you mean he wasn't there?"
"How are you so sure?"
"How are you so sure?"
"I don't have any."
"I remember something."
"I'm going to take a little nap."
"Aren't they all?"
"We are all proud of you."
"I'll tell you about it later."
"It's a game of chance."
"He was one of them."
"He is far from home."
"I don't have any others."
"Would you really do that for me?"
"Did you do this all by yourself?"
"You have to know how to share your pleasures."
"I've already spoken to him about it."
"Do you have a wife and children?"
"Hey, what's your name?"
"People are in camps."
"You're my hero, I swear."
"And we need you."
"I'm surprised, that's all."
"Are we waiting for someone else?"
"The keys are in the ignition."
"And she said yes."
"I need to practice."
"No, no, I'll do it."
"Do you want to join me?"
"She suspects it, I think."
"I need a woman."
"You were right about one thing."
"That's why you're here, right?"
"And in a modest house too."
"You never loved me."
"The money is on the table."
"My God, what is this?"
"I still have a lot to do."
"Goodbye, my love, my life."
"And what did you say to him?"
"I saw her, you know."
"I like you, you know."
"How are L.J. and Sara doing?"
"Initiate you ask him to be?"
"I said I understood."
"This is the big league."
"I'm not a kid."
"I never understood that."
"I have never been in love."
"I think she's sick."
"Where are my car keys?"
"Do you see this?"
"What was he looking for?"
"I had the same reaction."
"Not to me, anyway."
"One moment, please."
"I'll see you at home."
"I apologize."
"You don't just walk in like that."
"I'm not yet."
"You can come whenever you want."
"You think that's it?"
"You might need this."
"Okay, see you tomorrow."
"Do you want to play hide and seek?"
"I want you to give yourself."
"That's my way of speaking."
"He's one of my heroes."
"They did a good job."
"But I do my best."
"Stay focused on the present moment."
"And that made me happy."
"Is this what you were looking for?"
"Let me make things easier for you."
"You didn't go there?"
"I did the whole city."
"I didn't kiss him."
"But she never came."
"I have to do something first."
"Look where that got him."
"It's been like this forever."
"I thought you had changed."
"There must be an explanation."
"That was what I wanted."
"This is my honeymoon."
"Give me something to do."
"See you at the airport."
"I have to go do something."
"What do we decide?"
"It's a big day tomorrow."
"It's a birthday party."
"This is what happens to me."
"This may be the solution."
"But we need to talk."
"What did you do last night?"
"But we'll get through this."
"Then I arrived at his house."
"I think it was her."
"It's an art form."
"Come on, I need you."
"I need to talk to your mother."
"Do you want us to live together?"
"I know you miss him."
"Who loves you?"
"Do you know where she went?"
"Do you want us to accompany you?"
"Have you tried calling him?"
"What do you think of this one?"
"What do you think of this one?"
"Are you Spartacus's wife?"
"It was love at first sight."
"I'll tell you one day."
"As you taught me."
"I slept with another woman."
"What is all this?"
"What's going on here?"
"Why are you so sure?"
"I need to concentrate."
"There's something special about him."
"Anything will do."
"Do you remember my name?"
"I was held up at work."
"I've seen this before."
"I want to stay here this time."
"Let the police handle it."
"Open the door for me, please."
"I'm going to ask her to marry me."
"I know you're awake."
"There was only us."
"This invasion will bring you nothing."
"Would you like to dance with me?"
"That's nice of him."
"His orange body, his green legs?"
"Thank you for taking care of it."
"Or something like that."
"Do you have a permit for that?"
"Have you done any weight training?"
"She pulls a little to the right."
"They will not be able to compete."
"Look where that got me."
"You haven't read it?"
"You know we love you."
"I only want your love."
"He knows a lot of things."
"You didn't see me."
"Where were you all night?"
"I think we're good."
"I need to talk about it."
"Form a line here in front of me."
"What's going on there?"
"I'm not going out with him."
"Is that where you're going?"
"Is that where you're going?"
"No, you don't have it."
"What do you want to do later?"
"Like a fish in water."
"What else can he do?"
"It's just water."
"Once again, my condolences."
"I know he's innocent."
"No, I don't know how to dance."
"You can confide in me."
"Everyone wants to be in it."
"No, you won't do that."
"Do you know why I love you?"
"Maybe I'll do it."
"There was an investigation."
"My father did nothing."
"It's snack time."
"Show me what you've got."
"No, I don't have any money."
"Come take a look."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"I'm going to lay my cards on the table."
"Could we do that later?"
"What about children?"
"I think it can work."
"Do you want me to let go of you?"
"I thought you weren't coming."
"I didn't think I'd see you again."
"What did she do to you?"
"It looked like it."
"And you, what did you do?"
"Do you agree with him?"
"It was our first date."
"Can I get you one?"
"Do you think I'll make it?"
"I believe in many things."
"He will remember you, Spartacus."
"Am I not the King?"
"Let's go into the shade."
"I have to do this alone."
"I come to you in peace."
"You made a friend."
"I go there every year."
"I have plans for you."
"Do you think it's her?"
"The viceroy will be well guarded."
"No, you have to tell him first."
"I'm tired of walking."
"Can I tell you something?"
"She started screaming."
"What's on your mind?"
"I want to move on."
"It's us they want."
"Thank you for coming, Father."
"That's generous of you."
"I'm seeing someone else."
"It's your business."
"But it's going to cost you dearly."
"Sorry I doubted you."
"Don't do this to me now."
"We both love you."
"What happened yesterday?"
"Other than that, everything is fine."
"It will be better next time."
"Where did he get it?"
"I'll be there in a minute."
"It's good for the soul."
"You come from a hot planet."
"Did it make you feel better?"
"I think you know him."
"How old are you, Grandma?"
"What would it be?"
"I need a partner."
"Let's make a pair, him and me."
"I'll make you an offer."
"Here, this will do you good."
"But you didn't say anything."
"If you need me."
"If you need me."
"I think it's over."
"I always wanted to come here."
"Senator, you are on your own ground."
"You can always count on me."
"Your sight will return in due time."
"He's fine, he's fine."
"She's my cleaning lady."
"I am part of the family."
"This boy is our last hope."
"It won't last long."
"What will she think of you?"
"It's always good to take."
"You're a little early."
"I have a specimen of a spider."
"I want to be by your side."
"What would I say?"
"It is the Lord's day."
"Even just once?"
"I was going to ask you that question."
"You were just a child."
"They were taken captive?"
"You are just a child."
"I think it's you."
"There is something to eat."
"I asked him to stay."
"Not a word to the press."
"It's okay, I see it."
"And I love you too."
"That suits me perfectly."
"There must be more."
"Do you want me to show you?"
"I'll tell Dad."
"She has no idea."
"Please take it."
"I've never experienced this."
"I brought you into the world."
"You'll do just fine."
"A little more than average."
"Because I don't understand."
"How are you feeling, buddy?"
"This is its reason for being."
"Have you never had an assistant?"
"Your thoughts are with your mother."
"This is a starting point."
"The Chancellor seems hopeful."
"They are at war with Rome."
"Do you know what day it is?"
"And everything that goes with it."
"How should I go about it?"
"I don't remember him."
"A medical evacuation was requested."
"I love to see such beauty."
"What are you listening to?"
"I have the right to speak."
"No, you don't know anything about it."
"It took me by surprise."
"The day was very long."
"Would you like to do me a favor?"
"We are from the same family."
"Can I tell you a story?"
"I should have stayed with you."
"No, I'm not leaving you."
"Would you excuse me for a moment?"
"We saw it on the second floor."
"Do you know where he went?"
"Do you know where he went?"
"This is only part of it."
"I need his ships."
"Please, let it go."
"What does it say?"
"I never know what to say."
"Do you want me to come with you?"
"No, you didn't understand."
"Do whatever you can."
"I need some information."
"No, I'm not ready."
"I am one with the Force."
"I want to talk to you in private."
"And they control the plate."
"You can trust no one."
"There is another body."
"He has a message for you."
"How did he get it?"
"My name is on the door."
"Do we have a count of the prisoners?"
"What does it open?"
"This is the men's restroom."
"She had no family."
"I don't want anything from him."
"What can I do for you, Sebastian?"
"In a few weeks, we will know."
"I was watching."
"I talk to him every day."
"The rest of the garrison remains."
"I have a question to ask."
"I saw you with her."
"What's your name, by the way?"
"Thanks for playing the game."
"How long do we have to wait?"
"I didn't choose it."
"It's visiting time."
"You better be right."
"I take care of the money."
"I'll be back as soon as possible."
"I think we have everything."
"You're two hours late."
"I did everything myself."
"Why are you telling me this now?"
"I'm on edge."
"This is my life, you understand?"
"A year and a half, two years."
"I want to see for myself."
"I know you like it."
"I'll show you the room."
"Is it because of me?"
"Hey, is anyone there?"
"I think he likes it."
"Go take a look."
"Go take a look."
"Glad to hear you say that."
"I'll get you some coffee."
"Is it because of us?"
"Like I told you."
"I hope it works out."
"I didn't do anything to them."
"Do you know where it comes from?"
"When did you do all this?"
"Do you want to do it or not?"
"Buy him a drink, will you?"
"What should we do with him?"
"I am in the same situation."
"I know everyone here."
"No need to know more."
"No one can cross the Alps."
"I'm done, I'm done."
"I am very proud of her."
"Your Highness, I beg you."
"Because I said no."
"I didn't say a word."
"I'm going to make one."
"Actually, I'm sure of it."
"I have to go to the bathroom."
"I'll take a closer look."
"You said it last night."
"I know, but I don't understand."
"It's nice of you to come."
"Do you remember your mother?"
"Do you remember your mother?"
"Your name is on the list."
"Tell him I'm here."
"It'll take a second."
"I need my medicine."
"You should have come to see me."
"I have something planned."
"Look what I brought."
"What did you have to tell me?"
"I have a lead in Paris."
"It was like a dream."
"He will tell you the same thing."
"I'll take another one."
"I've been told that before."
"It's up to us to decide."
"Do as I told you."
"What do you do with your days?"
"His face looks familiar."
"Bring the parts to the shed."
"Wake up, please."
"What are we going to do to him?"
"When is she coming back?"
"Who do you think it is?"
"I don't know about that."
"What do I have in my body?"
"I had never seen it before."
"I've heard a lot of things."
"In place, please."
"When do we arrive?"
"I need my phone."
"Did you tell anyone?"
"Are you my voters or what?"
"You haven't seen everything."
"Glad you could come."
"What are you running from?"
"I'm fine, everything's fine."
"They found another body."
"I know what I have."
"There is something for everyone."
"I'm going to make love to you."
"What do we have on the car?"
"Are you waiting for someone else?"
"No, it was more than that."
"We dance in the same company."
"For the good of humanity."
"May the eternal light protect her."
"You're not a kid anymore."
"I want you to have fun."
"I'm flying out tonight."
"Do you still need me?"
"This is your daughter."
"Are you sure you can do it?"
"She had a long journey."
"They all want the same thing."
"She's just doing her job."
"You still have a lot to do."
"You are not yourself."
"What's holding them back?"
"I never touched it."
"Give me what you have."
"Can you do me a favor?"
"Can someone explain this to me?"
"He's smarter than you."
"It was my father's."
"Not if you don't want to."
"Look what we did."
"You didn't see that."
"I'm tired of this."
"No, I don't believe that."
"You think it's over?"
"I believe this belongs to you."
"I think you should leave."
"Do you want me to wake her up?"
"This is not a judgment."
"Didn't he tell you?"
"I need to talk to my wife."
"It's always been my dream."
"That's what he claims."
"I made them myself."
"We will take care of you."
"You've never met him."
"I saw you do that."
"I ask you to do it."
"There's no place like home."
"Are there any others?"
"I thought that was clear."
"How many years ago?"
"Do we have to go?"
"She told me that too."
"Does she know you're here?"
"Come on girls, let's go."
"The house pays."
"Take a look."
"It's a woman thing."
"We know it's you."
"It looks serious to me."
"Can I come?"
"The map, please."
"But we're not finished."
"We have an officer down."
"I think you'll like it."
"They are coming to force our hand."
"You knew what it was."
"Do you want me to call you back?"
"But we are not."
"Above all, what will I think of you?"
"I have a press conference."
"It saves us time."
"Don't think about anything else."
"Take all you can."
"Is it always like this here?"
"There are other ways."
"It's a nightclub."
"I can read, remember?"
"That's a very good point."
"It's a refund, actually."
"I know what she's doing."
"This path is open to you."
"There's only him."
"No one will be able to sell you anymore."
"I wish you had come."
"What's past is past."
"You knew what you were doing."
"It never happened."
"I'll come home as soon as I can."
"We are happy to be here."
"Because I have a plan."
"I hear it in your voice."
"I won't say any more."
"And what am I going to do?"
"I remember lessons."
"That doesn't mean anything to me at all."
"That's their way of doing things."
"I'll tell you about that later."
"It's included in the price."
"You told me the truth."
"I have something else planned."
"They might still be there."
"What if he never comes back?"
"You've never had one?"
"I can take you home."
"Did they do something to you?"
"It's a big day, huh?"
"You're not finished yet?"
"Sorry, but it's the truth."
"He will be here in a few minutes."
"He was a very good friend."
"She is not the same anymore."
"He might still be there."
"It's not just that."
"There was a commotion."
"There are some there."
"Any type of ship."
"Please sit down."
"Maybe it's my imagination."
"You have to do me a favor."
"I paint what I see."
"He took me by surprise."
"I'll talk to the boss about it."
"No, I don't want to know."
"We don't care about the kid."
"You want me to believe that?"
"You have your feet on the ground."
"I know exactly where it is."
"Who the hell are you?"
"All pilots, to your stations."
"Everything will be fine, I promise."
"Where did you get this information from?"
"I just saw it."
"I know it's her."
"My love, you come before God."
"You'd better rest."
"Do you know what it costs?"
"What can they possibly be talking about?"
"Did you do something to him?"
"Because she's a woman."
"We were at school together."
"Are you ready to go?"
"You have to be honest with me."
"No, he wasn't there."
"What do you expect from life?"
"That's a good sign, right?"
"She was happy that I knew."
"That's what it is."
"Do you know what I believe?"
"For the school newspaper?"
"I have to go to bed."
"I was the one who asked."
"How bad is it?"
"I have to get back to work."
"The exit is this way."
"No, that's not going to work."
"You call this love?"
"They do this all the time."
"And I am grateful to you."
"Got someone in mind?"
"You're going to need me."
"Does this name mean anything to you?"
"How dare you say that to me?"
"Someone should do something."
"Everything is fine, I assure you."
"Can we talk about something else?"
"I'll keep an eye on him."
"Have you tried talking to him?"
"I told you to come up."
"But we have little time."
"Either way, you win."
"No, I can't stay."
"It's only been a few weeks."
"You always say the same thing."
"And what did she do?"
"I am a man of peace."
"You have to give me something."
"There is always a lining."
"There was a theft."
"It was the best thing to do."
"That's his last name."
"I really have to go to the bathroom."
"I think she's in love."
"I have a task to accomplish."
"He seems fine."
"I brought you some coffee."
"I brought you some coffee."
"I need a friend."
"Where did you learn to count?"
"I didn't ask any questions."
"And what will happen?"
"Everyone will know."
"It's your turn now."
"Maybe it's him."
"I was thinking the exact same thing."
"I'm his bodyguard."
"You're going to have to come with us."
"I know as much as you do."
"I'll check the back."
"But we don't know anything about it."
"It's never the right time."
"Yes, I told him."
"A lot has been said."
"What does she have to do with it?"
"At least, for now."
"Tony, what happened?"
"Do you think you're my father?"
"Everyone has a past."
"If I may say so, Your Excellency."
"Don't lecture me."
"No, I don't see it."
"I bet you're hungry."
"Call me when you're done."
"I don't ask for your forgiveness."
"I will be the people's champion."
"Do you want to talk about this now?"
"What will you do?"
"You'll never see him again."
"Please understand me."
"Are you asking me that?"
"I'll take the same thing."
"Do you know what they want?"
"Everyone has a secret."
"Do you think I forgot?"
"Have you never heard of it?"
"Well, well, well."
"Well, I don't know."
"They are both fine."
"I'm doing it for your own good."
"Be careful what you wish for."
"It's completely legal."
"Can you make less noise?"
"Remember, you were six years old."
"This is a chance for me."
"Where do you want him to be?"
"There are police everywhere."
"I am a man of honor."
"I brought you some clothes."
"What's that on your face?"
"I know how this is going to end."
"I wonder where they are."
"That's the right word."
"You have to get me out of here."
"You have to get me out of here."
"I'm going to make myself a sandwich."
"You need a drink."
"So it has to happen."
"Can I have some money?"
"Take care, my dear."
"See you after school."
"I didn't want to."
"I know you're listening to me."
"I just bought it."
"I'm going to marry her."
"Can we move on?"
"No one will do it for you."
"But why did you do that?"
"You don't have a father."
"I heard about your father."
"It is stable at the moment."
"I'd like to talk to you for a minute."
"And that got me thinking."
"I need to talk to the police."
"There are dozens of them."
"He's done it before."
"Are you ready?"
"She only thinks about that."
"I have nothing more."
"Of course you're right."
"What was she wearing?"
"This is what I write."
"I have something interesting."
"I took all my money."
"You think that's it?"
"We must think about the future."
"I've always wanted to try this."
"We must not be seen."
"Who knows what it is?"
"Maybe it will work out."
"Tell him you love him."
"Because I needed it."
"Get that into your head."
"Have you had breakfast?"
"You've been through a lot."
"I know how much you love him."
"And nobody saw anything?"
"I have a bus to catch."
"He must have done something."
"Do what they tell you."
"Thanks for doing it so quickly."
"You have done the country a service."
"Is she one of your friends?"
"I know what day it is."
"My back is killing me."
"Where did you hear this name?"
"I've often wondered about that."
"One for me, one for you."
"Yes, of course you can."
"You have one now, Spartacus."
"It's just a machine."
"I'm getting out of here."
"We are what we eat."
"No nation can resist him."
"I've never experienced that."
"Thank you for what you do."
"You're easily impressed, Ramon."
"You must not go there."
"You can be proud of him."
"That sounds like a good idea."
"I'll give you one last chance."
"I was born in this house."
"That was all that was missing."
"Maybe you should sit down."
"I found it on the internet."
"I'm older than you."
"I came home."
"I went to college."
"Can I speak to a manager?"
"This army is for the Republic."
"Where did he find it?"
"I have known many women."
"Is that what you wanted?"
"Did you choose her as your understudy?"
"Don't you want to see me?"
"This is my first day here."
"I'm happy to do it."
"I think it might work."
"I tried to reach him."
"No, you can't leave."
"I've never seen a movie."
"Of what happened."
"I got it, it's good."
"Would you like some coffee?"
"I need you."
"I'm sure she'll understand."
"There are people here."
"There's something in it."
"What's going on?"
"Where do all these people come from?"
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
"You need to focus."
"I think I'll make it."
"At least once a week."
"Sir is a very good man."
"Yes, I told him about it."
"I want to tell you one thing."
"It's time to go to bed."
"I'll be right back, honey."
"I want her to see this."
"It's just the truth."
"No, they become the property of the king."
"She can't hear you."
"I'm surprised, that's all."
"You want me to believe that?"
"I take care of the other one."
"I'll tell you where and when."
"Finish what you started."
"I can take you to her."
"You have to find him."
"This is what I saw."
"But you know how it is."
"How did you get my number?"
"You look a lot like your mother."
"The bailiff will take the roll."
"Go home and pet yourself."
"I take you in my arms."
"It's very pretty at your place."
"He has a skull fracture."
"You must have some idea."
"That's why I love you."
"Maybe we shouldn't."
"See you at the hotel."
"But I have hope."
"It's deeper than that."
"I have to take care of him."
"You and I are the same."
"I wondered where she was."
"How could they do that?"
"Glad to hear you say that."
"What do you think it is?"
"She needs to know."
"Have you never been here?"
"And I know who you are."
"I know who you're talking about."
"I have it in my pocket."
"I have a friend with me."
"No, I'll be right there."
"The company is in the red."
"I will do what I can."
"Let me take care of him."
"It's a very beautiful role."
"She has been through a lot."
"You are as white as a sheet."
"They get what they want."
"Things happened."
"Whose office is this?"
"And how did it end?"
"I saw this bird yesterday."
"I've been told that often."
"She looks so happy."
"It is one of a kind."
"I don't have a home anymore."
"Do you know who did this?"
"Who can do such a thing?"
"We will always be there for you."
"No, that's not really it."
"Did she say anything else?"
"Maybe you can take it."
"Did something happen to you?"
"Yes, thank you for reminding me."
"What's left for us?"
"Did you have fun tonight?"
"We'll talk about it another time."
"I made it for you."
"I'm from another department."
"I will do what you ask."
"Well, what do you think?"
"She knows I love her."
"I'll show you how it's done."
"To them, I am Oliver Queen."
"God bless you, my son."
"It will be ready in a minute."
"Please call me back."
"I hope you understand that."
"My wife is inside."
"This is what awaits us."
"You don't like girls?"
"I need a dose."
"I was going to ask the same question."
"I don't even like him."
"Do you see what I see?"
"What's on your mind, Sebastian?"
"Did Mo send you?"
"Well, that's something."
"You'll make it this time."
"I can dance the Black Swan."
"How many bullets do you have left?"
"Don't go without me."
"I'll take you to see a doctor."
"I take the children to the village."
"I could be your grandfather."
"It's a cop bar."
"Where was it found?"
"What's on your mind?"
"He's one of your fans."
"And what do you say to that?"
"And what do you say to that?"
"Because he did."
"You will do as I say."
"Show me some respect."
"Sorry it took so long."
"Is that what you do?"
"We live in a free country."
"It's priceless."
"It is an honor for us."
"Please hurry up."
"No, he doesn't."
"Bryan, you did well."
"You are right about one thing."
"Is that what you would like?"
"I have a patient to see."
"Did someone talk to you?"
"These are love letters."
"What am I going to do with him?"
"What do I have to gain?"
"At least tell me his name."
"You always bring everything back to you."
"Little Bryan is a sweetheart."
"What happened there?"
"I think she's here."
"Don't be late."
"I want us to break up."
"Are we going?"
"She hasn't figured it out yet?"
"I'm glad to be home."
"I need another one."
"Almost a year ago."
"Can I call you that?"
"You know you love me."
"They have no proof."
"It's one of my rules."
"He did it all by himself."
"You may have seen it."
"I have a class to give."
"I have to leave you."
"I hope you find it again."
"Who is the good dog?"
"I never remember it."
"It must be inside."
"I just wanted to say thank you."
"I was unfair to you."
"Hundreds of thousands of dollars."
"Do you think he's right?"
"But what am I getting involved in?"
"She asked me the question."
"You'd better go."
"He's there all the time."
"I'm delighted to see you."
"Are you going to ask her to marry you?"
"There is another door."
"I'll make us some coffee."
"I know you're busy."
"It's a family name."
"He does it all the time."
"I was hoping we could talk."
"It's the order of things."
"I told you about him."
"I didn't bring it."
"And what about me?"
"I came to visit you."
"Do you know what I'm talking about?"
"Is all this yours?"
"What are your orders, my master?"
"No point in hiding it."
"Did you understand?"
"I thought you would be happy."
"She said it was okay."
"You have to promise me something."
"I found this on the internet."
"Could you do me a favor?"
"I have to go get something."
"I'm going to ask you to leave."
"I'm changing and I'm coming."
"Thanks for asking."
"Tell me when you're ready."
"No, we don't know anything about that."
"Glad to have you with us."
"Where do you want us to go?"
"Do you want to tell us something?"
"I need a man."
"That's what's right."
"Are you dizzy?"
"I know what you're playing at."
"We were talking."
"Do you make home visits?"
"No, it's not going well at all."
"Only one other knows the truth."
"I train every day."
"Can I be honest with you?"
"Can I spend the night here?"
"Can you pass me a towel?"
"So I'll tell you."
"How could I forget that?"
"I hope you are satisfied."
"I want to be near you."
"Come say hello to the lady."
"Come take a look."
"He never loved me."
"We have more important things to do."
"I've never laughed so much."
"How long do I have to wait?"
"I'll take you to the airport."
"I have to ask you to leave."
"I wrote him a letter."
"It was child's play."
"I'll ask him myself."
"I think he is."
"Where did he get this idea from?"
"Maybe it is."
"I was released on parole."
"I have some information for you."
"I went to see a doctor."
"Take him out of my sight."
"Have a drink for me."
"You're going to do me a favor."
"My people need me."
"I remember that night."
"That's where he lives."
"This is what we were looking for."
"I need to talk to them."
"I've seen this man before."
"Please remain seated."
"It's the result that counts."
"Who did you leave it with?"
"The account is in his name."
"Do you think they'll come back?"
"What kind of person is he?"
"Are you listening to what I'm saying?"
"Can I go now?"
"Come sit near me."
"I have to go home."
"And you're not?"
"There must be a way out."
"I asked him his name."
"I was going to ask her to marry me."
"I'll have to think about it."
"Do you know what you're missing?"
"I'll tell you exactly."
"You could have told me about it."
"How do you know where I live?"
"He's a very good guy."
"Of course I'll be there."
"Just around the corner."
"I tried to find you."
"I'll take care of the rest."
"I'll see you when I get back."
"So back to square one."
"We have a mission to accomplish."
"I tried to reason with him."
"Your father was a good man."
"Your father was a good man."
"It was nice to meet you."
"This is of paramount importance."
"It's fresh meat."
"That's what they'll say."
"I hope you believe me."
"I'm from the FBI."
"Do you know what will happen?"
"What should I do with this?"
"This is good music."
"Have I been good to you?"
"What am I becoming?"
"Do you want to talk about something?"
"I told you so, didn't I?"
"I spoke to your lawyer."
"Do you want me to forgive you?"
"I'm in love with someone else."
"Have you ever met a Jedi?"
"She wasn't in town."
"It's about you."
"Have you ever dishonored the gods?"
"She came out of nowhere."
"I'm here for a reason."
"I'm on the waiting list."
"I say what I say."
"I have some business to attend to."
"Have you spoken to your father?"
"I chose them myself."
"There is still someone."
"My friends are from the best world."
"Please, not this."
"Do you know what day it is?"
"This is my first time here."
"Do you know how it happened?"
"I want us to be friends."
"You've never seen one?"
"Have you done this before?"
"Nobody knows who it is."
"Please take it."
"I can't decide."
"It warms my heart."
"You have a big day tomorrow."
"I hope you're hungry."
"I went to the doctor."
"What are you cooking?"
"That's kind of my thing."
"I want you on my team."
"Oh yeah, I remember."
"Leave them out of it."
"Do you know where he might be?"
"You can come, if you want."
"You understood me very well."
"Here, I brought this for you."
"Enjoy it while it lasts."
"Left, right, left, right, left, right."
"I realized it."
"I want the most beautiful."
"I worked all night."
"I'll tell him myself."
"But I have to go."
"You chose."
"You should have accepted my offer."
"She says she's fine."
"For saving my life."
"I'm trying to lighten the mood."
"There's someone there."
"What was she?"
"I want to show you something."
"Have you ever thought about it?"
"You wanted to see me for that?"
"I will try to explain to you."
"I told him to stay."
"Are there any volunteers?"
"A signature, please."
"She is no longer among us."
"I have done a lot of things."
"They are not ours."
"Can I do it later?"
"I need a pen."
"That's what I'm talking about."
"I'm faster than you."
"A little over two years."
"But it was more than that."
"When does it begin?"
"I have a brain tumor."
"When will we have the results?"
"You don't have a house?"
"You are indeed at the Whites'."
"We'll return the favor."
"Believe me, please."
"What is happiness?"
"Are you a cop or what?"
"Do you mind if I come in?"
"Of course I'm happy."
"You never told him?"
"I know, but it's important."
"Sorry, but I have to go."
"What are you becoming?"
"How did you get here?"
"Do you have something to eat?"
"The ball is in our court."
"I took a look at it."
"Is there a message?"
"He better be good."
"I'm going to tell you a secret."
"You're doing very well."
"As we always have."
"That's where he works."
"Where did you get this idea from?"
"You just have to check."
"Have you ever used it?"
"Did he do it or not?"
"I think it worked."
"It's just a dress."
"It crossed my mind."
"I've got my eye on him."
"I'll make you some coffee."
"Your people need you."
"Information is power."
"Your toys are really pretty."
"He said the same thing."
"It has never been seen before."
"I know, I saw her."
"I'll get you a coffee."
"You can't talk about it."
"I tried to calm him down."
"He wants to tell you something."
"I don't want details."
"I'm going to make myself a coffee."
"What do you care?"
"I knew you were here."
"I'm willing to bet on it."
"He had to go home."
"Well, I did it."
"You knew, didn't you?"
"I wish you to be happy."
"I did it with pleasure."
"I already told you no."
"You look great."
"I was looking forward to meeting you."
"I guess that's normal."
"Go get me some ice cream."
"I'll see you next week."
"I have the right to an explanation."
"She gave me her number."
"I owe you money."
"It's a question of balance."
"It was just a suggestion."
"I know she loves me."
"We did well."
"I thought we were done."
"It's the end of the beans."
"It was a whim."
"He must be here somewhere."
"Have you ever been to Paris?"
"I can take care of her."
"It happens from time to time."
"I'll be there in ten minutes."
"The end of year ball."
"This is what I'm looking for."
"Maybe it was written."
"I think he's hungry."
"Are you listening to me?"
"Haven't you seen the movie?"
"She started screaming."
"At least, I don't think so."
"No, there was nothing."
"I'm telling you."
"It's time for us to go."
"I raise my glass to that."
"Please go ahead."
"You did it all by yourself."
"I feel much better now."
"They said it on the news."
"I hope you like it."
"I like to hear you say it."
"How did this happen?"
"It's part of my job."
"They take him to the hospital."
"You do what you can."
"If you don't mind."
"My men jumped after me."
"We must be able to address this subject."
"Maybe I could talk to him."
"You didn't warn him?"
"Maybe that's good."
"I want to do things right."
"I'm fed up with everything."
"You are safe now."
"She just had a baby."
"I like his way of thinking."
"The pleasure will be all mine."
"He's blindfolded, isn't he?"
"I always wanted to be a cop."
"I know her better than you."
"I'll be back later."
"We are glad to see you."
"This is real life."
"What color was her hair?"
"Where does she live?"
"You may have seen her."
"There is still one."
"The big day is coming soon."
"How did you end up here?"
"I saw the light on."
"How did it get here?"
"I knew you would."
"We waited all day."
"I read about it."
"Did he give you anything?"
"We might be onto something."
"I need a consultation."
"What kind of music do you like?"
"I have to wash my hair."
"Move over, please."
"Do what makes you happy."
"I've never tried this."
"What was he wearing?"
"You have a decision to make."
"Let me take a look at it."
"It happened all of a sudden."
"Is that lipstick?"
"Do you know me?"
"Thank you for coming."
"How long will it take?"
"You always think with your stomach."
"Can you bring some water?"
"You didn't tell me anything."
"If there is anything I can do."
"I need my son."
"Well, you paid, I give."
"Don't you want to know why?"
"It was as simple as that."
"You didn't say it."
"This is a golden opportunity."
"I wondered where he was."
"I remember my mother."
"Do you know what we call that?"
"Can you show me the way?"
"We are going in the right direction."
"You have to be nice to me."
"You don't know where he is?"
"You're a little late."
"Do you understand what they are saying?"
"I'll say whatever you want."
"Stay calm and don't move."
"Please follow me, I beg you."
"Everything you've done."
"It looks ready."
"She agrees with me."
"She didn't do anything to you."
"They did their best."
"Nice to see you too."
"Do you think he'll come back?"
"Do you know what I'm looking at?"
"Of course you love him."
"It's well and truly over."
"But you don't know anything about it."
"It's a treasure map."
"Thanks for coming, guys."
"You've been brainwashed."
"You have no say."
"I can give you the money."
"Don't try to follow me."
"There are side effects."
"What's this thing worth?"
"Come down, show me your safe conduct."
"Say, can you see my eyes?"
"You don't want that."
"I have to think about my future."
"I thought you wanted to bet."
"I thought it was over."
"She looks good to me."
"We provide service to the community."
"We'll see how much you have."
"I found you a bird."
"Can we ask you a few questions?"
"We agreed."
"Who is this guy?"
"Did you go to school?"
"I feel at home here."
"Yes, when you know the system."
"I want you to meet him."
"Do you like seafood?"
"I think that will be all."
"I brought you something to eat."
"Do you have what it takes?"
"You'll never get out of here."
"He can do other things."
"Have you seen a lone sniper?"
"There could be more."
"Look what I'm bringing you."
"Do you think it's important?"
"Of course I'm going."
"The eighth will be the first."
"I still have a lot of work to do."
"Oh my God, you're right."
"This isn't a bluff?"
"I just need you."
"It looks like a thieves' market."
"You don't need him."
"I don't expect anything in return."
"Honey, what happened?"
"Let's look on the bright side."
"Places he had been."
"Thank you for giving me this chance."
"I have to remember that."
"You remind me of her."
"You should be in the hospital."
"Come with me, if you want."
"No, no, I'll take care of it."
"A little grain to become strong."
"You must forgive me."
"This is what you need."
"My little princess, come to your senses."
"What if it was your son?"
"I have to ask you a favor."
"We are very proud of him."
"Give my regards to your wife."
"Anyone else want some?"
"Did you bring me a present?"
"Don't like flying?"
"What are you listening to?"
"The mothership is ours."
"There was something new."
"What else could I say?"
"That's what I do."
"Same as last time."
"We have the circus guy."
"There are so many people."
"You played me."
"How can I make amends?"
"Are you doing well at school?"
"Is this the boat from the movie?"
"I don't have any other."
"Can I see you for a second?"
"Take her here before dark."
"Wait, I have a double call."
"Because you are my brother."
"Yes, it's gold."
"I'm as surprised as you are."
"What more do you want to know?"
"I think I should leave."
"I think I should leave."
"What is she waiting for?"
"Who else could it be?"
"We found her like that."
"What's going on?"
"I would like to speak to my wife."
"You have to see it to believe it."
"You're still in love with her."
"He is one of them."
"Do you want to be friends?"
"I'll pour us a drink."
"What are you doing in these hills?"
"I have been married three times."
"You know what would be cool?"
"Barry was treated with great courtesy."
"I have a competitive spirit."
"I thought you had changed."
"Are you holding a salon or are you buying?"
"It made me very happy."
"It's Brandon's birthday."
"I think we should leave."
"It's a figure of speech."
"I have to go to the bathroom."
"You will listen to me very carefully."
"He took care of me."
"Try not to think about it."
"Try not to think about it."
"Can I have a new cup?"
"Let me ask you something."
"It'll take us an hour."
"It's a gunshot."
"I know you can talk."
"I entered through the window."
"Why are you in my unit?"
"You have no pride?"
"What's coming up?"
"I know it's there."
"You might even be smart."
"I want you to kiss me."
"Your little godmother of my two?"
"Tell me who you work for."
"I am a very busy man."
"She has nothing to say."
"Let's see what we can see."
"Do you know what that means?"
"We'll meet on the beach."
"I appreciate you coming."
"I need your support."
"Are you homesick?"
"You better go back."
"It's a very good movie."
"Was it like the mouse?"
"Haven't you thought about that?"
"No, you are not happy."
"I think I am."
"This is your point of view."
"May the gods be with you."
"I think he's ready."
"No, I just made it up."
"I sent you a message."
"Sorry I scared you."
"I had a lovely evening."
"For a few days or for a while."
"Go to the bathroom."
"He spoke about the Black Pearl."
"I only see one."
"He'll be there in a minute."
"The whole town knows about it."
"I have some questions for you."
"Let me take care of her."
"Anywhere, but not here."
"I have to find a way."
"I have to explain something to you."
"I think it should be fine."
"I take back what is mine."
"Hey, do you want to see something?"
"There is one thing."
"Maybe we'll take a vacation."
"She is a very beautiful girl."
"What do you want him to do?"
"You know I'm innocent."
"I came to see someone."
"No time to think."
"I think he loves me."
"You've gone to great lengths."
"I make myself comfortable."
"I'm ready to do it."
"It was good to see you."
"I have a job to finish."
"Thank you very much for inviting us."
"You'll see it soon enough."
"I'll do it with you."
"I'm just having fun."
"She is a very beautiful woman."
"It was great to see you again."
"What are you doing here?"
"And you, what are you doing here?"
"What are you doing here?"
"He opened my eyes."
"I do what I say."
"But the law is the law."
"It's not yours."
"Can I tell you something?"
"You don't have the key?"
"You have to do this for me."
"I know who I am now."
"Too many lives are at stake."
"I have a date."
"What did he do now?"
"I went to Atlantic City."
"When I get out, I'll be rich."
"You're up early."
"Place your order and I'll deliver."
"Do you want to play fetch?"
"All prisoners, return to their cells."
"I'm here every day."
"He is smarter than me."
"I don't know anything about her."
"There, with the shopping bag."
"This time it's different."
"I brought you flowers."
"You need to go to the police."
"She's gone for good."
"I've done all genres."
"I have one for you."
"I wish you much happiness."
"He was thought to be on drugs."
"He made me an offer."
"Can't we choose our color?"
"I'm surprised to see you."
"Whose number is this?"
"He disappeared from circulation."
"Does it suit me?"
"Haven't we met before?"
"You can never be sure."
"The witness may sit down."
"I had to see it."
"Are these friends of yours?"
"Everyone on the field."
"And a map for your journey."
"I brought you something."
"Where do you want us to go?"
"Do what you want to me."
"This is my masterpiece."
"No, you weren't."
"I've made hundreds of them."
"I took the first step."
"Outside, there are the yellow pages."
"Was he a friend of yours?"
"I took her home."
"I spend my days with them."
"I've never had that."
"I'm going to feed him."
"They take what they find."
"She never said anything."
"Sorry to be so late."
"I think I'm ready."
"We are meant to be together."
"I feel at home here."
"This is a step forward."
"You had plenty of time."
"Give them what they want."
"Take some time to think about it."
"I risked everything for you."
"What would become of her?"
"Look where that got us."
"Your brother told me."
"Nothing is known about her."
"Of course I know her."
"I want it to be you."
"This lawyer is calling me from Texas."
"You don't have a girlfriend?"
"Take me, please."
"Maybe he'll keep it."
"She'll be here in a moment."
"Since the age of thirteen."
"Did he talk about me?"
"She wrote me a letter."
"I know what you think."
"It's you she wants."
"Do I have to do everything myself?"
"The rest will come little by little."
"What if she's too busy?"
"A northwest wind is blowing."
"I spoke to a lawyer."
"We may have a witness."
"Do you know where she comes from?"
"I made you something to eat."
"That explains a lot."
"I need more light."
"We'll teach you respect."
"No, don't change the subject."
"Then we put on the black hood."
"I was made for this program."
"Yeah, I told you."
"White and Pink, one car each."
"Do you forgive me?"
"What does it cost?"
"I requested armored support."
"It will take a day or two."
"How dare you speak to me like that?"
"Can you introduce us there?"
"Go ahead, you can do it."
"For what it means."
"Thank you very much, but I have to go."
"Breakfast will be ready."
"I guess that's good."
"How many people can say that?"
"That's just as well."
"Is this what you were looking for?"
"It's solid money."
"A bachelor party."
"She wasn't herself."
"I'm going to go get some coffee."
"Because I'm your wife."
"This is my moment of glory."
"Nobody knows about Mr. Blue?"
"If only it were that easy."
"Sounds interesting to me."
"That's what we thought."
"It's a man's job."
"Can we stay in your wheel?"
"I'll take you with me."
"What else do I need to know?"
"Say whatever you want."
"Let go of me, please."
"It's been a great year."
"On the salvation of your soul?"
"It's just a letter."
"As much as we can be."
"May all your dreams come true."
"I appreciate you coming."
"I went to university."
"This is your Christmas present."
"It's a fundraiser."
"I think I got it."
"And it's a beautiful day."
"I know a lot about you."
"No one should continue this work."
"Do you remember this song?"
"I grew up in an orphanage."
"I want to go on a literary pilgrimage."
"That's kind of you, Captain."
"We moved on."
"You're overshadowing me."
"I need to get back in shape."
"Please be careful."
"Madam, is there anything I can do?"
"You're not answering your phone anymore?"
"Of course I'll be there."
"I listen to it all the time."
"Yes, two years ago."
"Oh my God, that's true."
"What were they doing?"
"That's very kind of you."
"Did your trip go well?"
"With ups and downs."
"Have you ever done it?"
"You're welcome, guys."
"I have to go to San Francisco."
"There have been changes."
"What am I missing?"
"But this time it was different."
"No, we're not going."
"Where have you been all this time?"
"I have something to announce."
"We had a good time."
"Radio contact at the next checkpoint."
"What is done?"
"Where do you want him to go?"
"Just in time for dinner."
"He came from the future, too."
"He's a friend of mine."
"Maybe you should drink less."
"It's a very simple question."
"You're going to tell me the truth."
"Do something with your life."
"There is another girl."
"I can take care of you."
"This might be the right one."
"Can you send him a message?"
"Who else could it be?"
"What does that do?"
"I'll tell Booth."
"I'll be done in a minute."
"Do you have something for me?"
"When was that?"
"What happened to Nora?"
"That was what was planned."
"There were cops everywhere."
"Do you want us to do it?"
"A symbol of peace, my Colonel."
"It's my wedding anniversary."
"I have to get there."
"No, there is little to do."
"I have them, I have them."
"He's a really nice boy."
"Nice Guy, we have a cop."
"Chess, a game of kings."
"The most beautiful woman in the world."
"I'll cheer you up."
"He's back in town."
"You're going to have to get used to it."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"You should have told us."
"Does she have a last name?"
"But what am I going to tell him?"
"What matters is us."
"Can I tell you a story?"
"Do you know where she is?"
"You are a man of honor."
"Do you mind if I keep it?"
"It's more than a theory."
"You may have a concussion."
"You're a little comedian, aren't you?"
"I would like you to explain to me."
"My life is an open book."
"I told you, didn't I?"
"Haven't you read the newspapers?"
"How can I count on you?"
"I have someone else."
"We have some catching up to do."
"Maybe a little later."
"I have to go to work."
"I was taken aback."
"I have a ton of work."
"She will be happy to see you."
"I'll give you one more chance."
"You would have found it on your own."
"How should I tell you?"
"This was just the beginning."
"See you at the ceremony."
"Tell that woman to come back."
"But it's the only way."
"No, I'm just saying."
"Have you ever heard of it?"
"Someone called the cops."
"Sorry I doubted you."
"Do you believe in the Holy Virgin?"
"With Hank Williams records."
"You should have come earlier."
"Because he said so."
"Thank you for taking care of me."
"It was his idea."
"Let me take care of everything."
"I saw a mouse go by."
"You can put me to work."
"I just wanted to give this to you."
"You're right on time."
"You haven't been followed?"
"No, we're not interested."
"I love you too, my darling."
"Hey, what's going on?"
"She must not know."
"Did I get an x-ray?"
"I learned from the best."
"There are plenty of them here."
"We both want it."
"Could I have some water?"
"It's just a box."
"I'm proud of you, man."
"Do you think he'll come?"
"I have to go to the bank."
"I have to get used to it."
"I want to be your friend too."
"You're making fun of me again."
"It's mating season."
"She can't be."
"It's a matter of justice."
"No, I'm not anymore."
"I forgot to ask him."
"Who told you to come in?"
"How did you get into my house?"
"Have you ever had a dog?"
"I'm glad to meet you."
"Are you a girl or not?"
"I pray for the same thing."
"I want him to be there."
"I have a schedule to keep."
"You have had a long journey."
"You have to see this."
"But here, we're in business."
"Tell me you believe me."
"My dear friend, are you unharmed?"
"It can't be a coincidence."
"It's a girl thing."
"He did a good job."
"I thought you wanted it."
"Do with it what you will."
"What is it, little one?"
"I'm getting out of here."
"It depends on who you ask."
"She's fine, she's fine."
"No, I will never do that."
"Where was it made?"
"Did he tell you his name?"
"You have to give it your all."
"I'll be ready in a minute."
"It looks like a circus mouse."
"I feel it in my bones."
"Is that what you have?"
"I see you're busy."
"It's your turn, Mr. Bond."
"Do you know what day it is?"
"A little more to the left."
"Let's not talk about that here."
"Don't feel sorry for me."
"I'm starting to get used to it."
"You will leave like everyone else."
"I think we know each other."
"I have been married twice."
"Are there any survivors?"
"Thanks, I owe you one."
"Can you do me a favor?"
"You know how children are."
"I was told the opposite."
"You have to take care of me."
"I need to talk to my son."
"You should have seen his face."
"There was no question of that."
"It's very simple, actually."
"I hope so, for your sake."
"Please take me."
"It's nice to see you again."
"In my opinion, it's simple."
"It's getting better and better."
"They are heading north."
"There are loads of them."
"I thought we were friends."
"This is to make up for it."
"I had never been here."
"I'll take care of it myself."
"I need to search you."
"The Last Judgment was prevented."
"I have to get out of here."
"It is a security measure."
"It must be around here."
"He is a very important client."
"Just what we needed."
"You are part of a brotherhood."
"I think I heard something."
"Let me ask you something."
"Go wait for me in the car."
"I'm going to spend the night here."
"Do you want to join forces?"
"I see it on your face."
"How about we go have a drink?"
"The Black Pearl is yours."
"You need a bath."
"I have people to see."
"I'm the boss now."
"I heard the same thing."
"I'm happy for you."
"She is younger than me."
"There are rules here."
"He played me."
"She never married."
"And what did you talk about?"
"Boss, I need to talk to you."
"The accounts are in his name."
"I'm keeping an eye on you."
"But you're in luck."
"It will only take a minute."
"He did the same with me."
"I called you last night."
"Thank you for telling me that."
"Give my regards to your wife."
"Come to the bathroom."
"Do you want to get shot?"
"It's a retirement home."
"Well, what do we have here?"
"I mean, I love you."
"I take my work seriously."
"You have to get out of here."
"It's his way of being."
"What do you want us to do?"
"Do you want to join us?"
"What do you want me to say?"
"It always happens like this."
"I really love you, you know."
"Your father was a good man."
"I need a map."
"I wish you a lot of fun."
"But I promise you one thing."
"Is that what you were doing?"
"What are you going to do?"
"Do you know what he says?"
"I thought you were different."
"I hope it suits you."
"How did it get here?"
"I don't have the answers."
"He will have an answer for you."
"Mind your language, in my block."
"That's it for tonight."
"He never came here."
"You have to think about your future."
"Who is this charming young girl?"
"Where did he put it?"
"How would he train it?"
"I came for work."
"And Lee Harvey Oswald, do you know him?"
"How far are we from D.C.?"
"Don't you remember me?"
"It seemed okay."
"I think that's enough."
"This decision is not yours."
"It's because I love you."
"I'm here, everything's fine."
"I wouldn't worry about it."
"Maybe more, maybe less."
"If you need anything, call me."
"Clear your mind."
"She invited us to dinner."
"Do you want to hear some good news?"
"You can be proud of yourself."
"Didn't you see the sign?"
"That time is over."
"I understand what you are doing."
"How are you?"
"Do you need anything else?"
"I'm glad to have you."
"We'll see you another day."
"I need a cigarette."
"No, I don't know you."
"Would you like a glass of sherry?"
"We'll find you something."
"Your mother is in the hospital."
"I thought it would be okay."
"I want us to get along."
"It's bigger than expected."
"I expected this answer."
"An hour, an hour and a half."
"She was my grandmother's."
"It belonged to my grandmother."
"Only what you bring to it."
"I brought you some books."
"He's smarter than me."
"For once in your life."
"And what happened to you?"
"No, she'll go with the Spaniard."
"Did anyone else know?"
"Actually, I think so."
"Request immediate intervention of an armored vehicle."
"I have a telegram for you."
"You think I knew that?"
"How can you stay so calm?"
"A beer, please."
"I need you, Mom."
"It makes sense to me."
"There is something behind it."
"You should see the other guy."
"The doors will open soon."
"I had another one."
"Something will have to be done."
"So, what is it about?"
"Take it, please."
"So why did you do it?"
"The prisons are starting to fill up."
"I know you're right."
"I never saw them again."
"I have little choice."
"This is a very good story."
"He taught him the alphabet."
"You asked."
"I hope you will be happy."
"I have thousands of players."
"You're not there at all."
"I knew he would make it."
"What did you come here to do?"
"Thank you for your attention."
"No, he doesn't have it."
"You didn't want to go?"
"It seemed like an eternity."
"You know what I was thinking?"
"They say you're cold."
"It was much more than that."
"What do you know about it?"
"Have you seen Dr. Bishop?"
"I know what that means."
"It's a birthmark."
"If I could have your attention."
"I'd like some coffee, please."
"It's a kind of tradition."
"You say that all the time."
"Finish what you started."
"I'll be here when you get back."
"No, you would keep me for yourself."
"Hey, how did it go?"
"You will give me your word."
"Tell him it's you."
"What would become of me?"
"It's stronger than us."
"I have a lot of boyfriends."
"Is there anything new?"
"One bonus bullet per lover."
"They are above us."
"I brought you your lunch."
"Something must have happened to him."
"Let's see what he'll do."
"Douglas, take her back to her room."
"But the first ones were waiting for us."
"But it's the only solution."
"Do you remember the second wave?"
"Can I use the phone?"
"I was young at the time."
"I have a runny nose."
"Turn around and look at the lady."
"No, you don't have to."
"I took one on Friday."
"Do you have one for me?"
"See you at home."
"I'll find you one."
"Haven't you heard it?"
"Don't turn your back on him."
"I'll leave you to your own devices."
"Burt, you have a visitor."
"No, but it won't be long."
"You were born older."
"It's the inside that counts."
"It's different this time."
"Is that clear enough for you?"
"I wanted to wish you good luck."
"How could this happen?"
"I sent him a message."
"Do you want to kiss me?"
"There are people everywhere."
"Who is your group leader?"
"I'm going to read you a story."
"Please, not now."
"In the crowd, in solitude."
"There are still some here."
"Everyone to the cellar."
"I'll have them for you tomorrow."
"Do you have a credit card?"
"Sooner or later he will speak."
"No, we're not married."
"It's a farewell gift."
"I want you both."
"Will there be a next time?"
"I have a question too."
"Go to the bathroom."
"But you're lucky."
"You came to tell me that?"
"There's something on it."
"What do I tell them about Dad?"
"You've known it from the beginning."
"You are now a Kappa sister."
"I don't think like that."
"That won't do."
"It's the next one on the right."
"There was a battle."
"Do you know who this belongs to?"
"It's heaven on earth."
"Are you calling my friend a faggot?"
"I'm delighted to be here."
"Praise God you are here."
"I think it's perfect."
"You just said the opposite."
"I know what it says."
"I had nothing to do."
"I don't remember, Colonel."
"Can you take care of that?"
"Same as the others."
"We both know it."
"No, they're here to chat."
"I just want her back."
"It is good for neuro."
"Well, what do you say?"
"They are like everyone else."
"These are tears of joy."
"I'm going to do more than that."
"We still need you."
"You don't have any change?"
"And I will obtain justice for my father."
"This way, please."
"I think it will heal."
"I knew they would."
"Tell him not to come."
"Is everyone on board?"
"I'm going to take a walk outside."
"Hey, what happened?"
"Are you sure you want this?"
"You didn't tell them anything?"
"What will happen to you?"
"How can you live like this?"
"Do you know that?"
"Can you give us a moment?"
"How did the work go?"
"My father told him that."
"It's compressed air."
"You only have one minute."
"I think it's going to rain."
"He should be here this morning."
"I know it was hard."
"And it's for life."
"I thought you understood."
"I think she's hungry."
"Ace saw Vegas his way."
"So that your action is beautiful."
"Let's go, it's good."
"What do you want him to say?"
"I liked it, I would like to continue."
"Glad to have you with us."
"There it is, I see it."
"I had to do it."
"When things go wrong, who do they call?"
"You're going to make fun of me."
"What you always wanted."
"You're the one who doesn't understand."
"Who else knew?"
"This will be my wedding present."
"I don't think I am."
"You haven't left yet?"
"This is my cell phone number."
"I want to talk to him in person."
"It will only take a moment."
"Glad to have you back with us."
"No, this is not the time."
"It's great to see you."
"We have the right to know."
"My beautiful only loves me."
"That was all there was to it."
"You must have heard about it."
"Yes, everyone knows that."
"What more could you ask for?"
"It's happening right now."
"I hope that's it."
"I take it to my office."
"How could this have happened?"
"I am pleased to do so."
"Did he tell you about that?"
"Did he tell you about that?"
"Please tell me."
"What if it's too late?"
"You did a great job."
"Of course, like everyone else."
"Do you know who she looked like?"
"I need to be here."
"Who had this brilliant idea?"
"What I told you."
"I have something to finish."
"I knew he was there."
"Who saw him last?"
"I know you tried."
"Actually, I wanted to talk to you."
"I thought you understood."
"I've been here for a while."
"What did you have?"
"It's half mine."
"There are lots of things."
"Do you want to go to the beach?"
"I admire what you do."
"I was glad to see you again."
"You want to stay with this guy."
"Looks like it's me."
"She seems fine."
"Do you have something to say?"
"You never loved him."
"What if she doesn't come back?"
"We do this every day."
"I hope I can do it."
"Do you want to keep all the potatoes?"
"I was hoping you would say that."
"Maybe we'll find something."
"He's just a boy."
"What am I doing?"
"Do you want me to do that?"
"We did well to come."
"Have you seen this before?"
"You will know in due time."
"Do you have any brothers or sisters?"
"Boss, what's going on?"
"I thought he was joking."
"You're worth the wait."
"I need to talk to this man."
"I hope you're having fun."
"No cops in the temple."
"You look more beautiful than ever."
"That's your point of view."
"He agrees with me."
"You're the one I wanted."
"I think it's great."
"Don't you want to stay here?"
"From my mother."
"I just want to talk."
"We are having dinner."
"Something must be going on."
"What are you going to do about it?"
"You only hear my voice."
"I've never seen them."
"Perhaps the time has come."
"God knows what he's doing."
"It wasn't mine."
"Where were you last night?"
"I'm busy at the moment."
"You don't need this."
"You are doing the right thing."
"We are in the central network."
"What if I don't sign?"
"Do you see what you're doing?"
"I want to see him."
"The law is on our side."
"We're both here."
"Are you from the FBI?"
"I'm here to talk to you."
"You have to promise me one thing."
"It was nice talking to you."
"What's that for?"
"You're not talking about me?"
"They didn't find it."
"Can we simulate cerebral flow?"
"I'm from the forensics department."
"Do you know any happily married couples?"
"These people threatened my family."
"But it's for the best."
"We are both the same."
"You got a good deal."
"I was looking forward to meeting you."
"He has to go home."
"I was trained for this."
"Can I ask your name?"
"I have lots of friends."
"Do I look like this?"
"Is there a cure?"
"You have no way out."
"She went back to her mother's house."
"I see who you're talking about."
"I'll get rid of him."
"I want to take care of her."
"Just a moment, I'll pass it to you."
"My father taught me that."
"Have you talked to your parents?"
"The big vegetable of this kitchen."
"Do what you think is right."
"You want to see his balls fry."
"Should I put this on an account?"
"Did someone call for me?"
"Are you taking care of the car?"
"I have to fix this."
"Have you heard of me?"
"Have you heard of me?"
"Who taught you to drive?"
"I already told you."
"I told you so, right?"
"They leave Middle-earth."
"I heard you in there."
"I remember this story."
"Can we talk to you for a minute?"
"Where did you get this number?"
"Can you give us an example?"
"Come on, I'll introduce her to you."
"That's good to hear."
"But we had a lot of fun."
"All roads lead to Rome."
"Show what you can do."
"I thought you would be pleased."
"Pass on what you have learned."
"It's nothing exceptional."
"Of course I came."
"The children need you."
"Yes, in fact you remember."
"This is my pet."
"Where do I start?"
"Yes, a few years ago."
"The long-awaited moment has arrived."
"You have to do it."
"Can't you talk to him?"
"We have our say."
"It's completely normal."
"You know I like that."
"How can you let him decide?"
"I was on a business trip."
"I see you're feeling better."
"What will it look like?"
"What do you do with your days?"
"I have a very good reason."
"I've been watching you for a while."
"I have them all the time."
"He comes here every day."
"I think I'll walk."
"I have to go back inside."
"I want to show you something."
"I'll walk you home."
"Maybe you should think about it."
"This is the moment of truth."
"Greta made you a sandwich."
"He will be happy when he comes home."
"If only it were that easy."
"Haven't you guessed yet?"
"I hope you get better."
"Maybe they have a dog."
"We have something for you."
"It taught me a lesson."
"That's what we say."
"No, you weren't there."
"I left you something."
"Where is the exit?"
"Do you think you're my mother?"
"Do you want something to eat?"
"Isn't that right, my son?"
"Actually, it's quite simple."
"You know I'm telling the truth."
"It shows on your face."
"Look on the bright side."
"I haven't seen him since."
"What do you know about love?"
"I advise you to go there."
"He just needs rest."
"We are together all the time."
"She went shopping."
"This is what she said."
"You had to know that."
"I can defend myself."
"He comes from a good family."
"How do you say 'planque' in French?"
"But I digress."
"There is someone there."
"How could I forget?"
"I told them about you."
"What if you get caught?"
"That's what I would like."
"We're done with this."
"I know you want it."
"Is she beautiful?"
"We'll go whenever you want."
"I know what you're up to."
"He had a golden opportunity."
"I'm just a passenger."
"I had a visitor."
"That's it, I remember."
"He has a thing for you."
"A towel, please."
"Where did he come from?"
"She's not yours."
"What's over?"
"How was your night?"
"Can you tell me something?"
"This is one of the best."
"I talk to him all the time."
"Don't you remember him?"
"See what condition he is in."
"You don't need it anymore."
"Can I go like this?"
"The neighbors came back so suddenly."
"How did you get here so fast?"
"Everyone will tell you."
"No, we can't enter."
"How can I be sure?"
"It will never be the same again."
"I had nothing to say."
"I'll take care of your luggage."
"It's at the end of the corridor."
"Tell me what's going on."
"Ready to go home?"
"Since when do you talk like that?"
"Where are you going?"
"I can go by myself."
"I can go there by myself."
"Hopefully they'll make it through the night."
"God bless you for the coffee."
"I'm coming to check on you."
"Why did you bring her here?"
"Did you look towards the car?"
"Do you know how to use this?"
"Do you know what day it is?"
"That's what you said."
"Signals as big as your arm."
"You don't have a brother."
"Do you take me for a thief?"
"You must not touch it."
"She went to her mother's house."
"There are other methods."
"They will be here in two days."
"Yes, what is it about?"
"Have they left?"
"I'll be the first to enter."
"You took my son from me."
"I needed to see you."
"Can I have some beer?"
"What if she doesn't want to?"
"You know what I wish for?"
"Where do we sign?"
"It's over, it's going to be okay."
"You and I are going to talk."
"You have to tell me more."
"Don't come to San Francisco."
"I want to get out of the country."
"I'm still the same person."
"It's okay, it's me."
"Drop that right now."
"There is a solution."
"I'll have a word with him about it."
"Go to the waiting room."
"Did your trip go well?"
"And there are many."
"I erased all the fingerprints."
"I'll call you in the morning."
"You should be with your family."
"The plane leaves in an hour."
"You are part of my life."
"She's one of my patients."
"I've loved you for so long."
"Are you asking me the question straight out?"
"Dad knows what he's doing."
"You have until tomorrow morning."
"But you have to be ready."
"You're the one who left."
"We're making headlines."
"I'm telling you this like this."
"What do you mean exactly?"
"It's because of the weather."
"See you in two weeks."
"What if you stayed this time?"
"Whose phone is this?"
"Put your arms around me."
"It was just a test."
"They say I look like him."
"Can I sit closer?"
"This is for my girlfriend."
"You have had a serious accident."
"Are you at the end of your rope?"
"Maybe we should split up."
"I know you do."
"Nobody tells me what to do."
"Do you know who she was talking to?"
"What is this story?"
"I guess you are confident."
"What are they?"
"I was the only one who knew."
"No, I didn't see anyone."
"No, you don't like him."
"Everything we did."
"We have a plane to catch."
"I'll be there in half an hour."
"Shall we have a beer?"
"You promised me an audience."
"Who did you tell?"
"You have to do it for me."
"I think he understood."
"I suspected something."
"I'm going back to the hospital."
"You don't watch TV?"
"He is right."
"Do you want some coffee?"
"I worked all day."
"I wonder what it's like."
"It's a part of me."
"She has her feet on the ground."
"Did he tell you his name?"
"You can watch if you want."
"I wonder where they are going."
"Send a car, install a device."
"Don't you know the rules?"
"Give me one good reason."
"You've had a long journey."
"Thank you for taking me back to town."
"I chose it myself."
"Tell her we miss her."
"This is my mother."
"You will always be in my heart."
"I have something to take."
"I went to the hospital."
"You'll be safer here."
"I should have come to see you."
"Can I be honest with you?"
"I'll tell you about it later."
"It kept me awake."
"This is a chance for us."
"It was sold to the highest bidder."
"I don't know what happened."
"I want us to find him."
"He always brought me luck."
"Yes, that's how it is."
"Have you ever seen one?"
"Orders come from above."
"Have you read all these books?"
"Once you have paid."
"Who's on the other end of the line?"
"It's early for Las Vegas."
"It's haute couture."
"What happened there?"
"Do you remember your name?"
"Wine, please."
"Is it you they want?"
"What was he doing in your hip?"
"At the casino, she was a queen."
"On the other side of the park."
"I remember that moment."
"I wish you a lot of luck."
"I have a long way to go."
"I've only just started."
"I hope you like it."
"Because he's a man."
"We focus on the Zone."
"What are you doing around here?"
"He can support his request."
"Please leave us."
"I have a cop on horseback."
"I learned about it this morning."
"Are you a friend of hers?"
"How can you be sure?"
"We'll see you another time."
"I know what it takes."
"She is in a nursing home."
"It's up to us to do the same."
"I think it's ready."
"They must have sensed our presence."
"Can you take a picture of us?"
"He might be on vacation."
"But what can be done about it?"
"I called him this morning."
"I knew he would like it."
"Tell us what you see."
"I just want to say one thing."
"Thank you for stopping by."
"Does he have family?"
"You'll get it next time."
"I guess you're right."
"They did what they wanted."
"Let him know I'm here."
"I have to take care of her."
"Do you want me to shut up?"
"I hear what you're saying."
"Do you want a glass of milk?"
"I heard that somewhere."
"Do you get along well with him?"
"He is older than me."
"But I will do my best."
"And you, where are you from?"
"Where is it?"
"You are a good little girl."
"When are you coming home?"
"No one will take you seriously."
"You better believe it."
"You need money."
"Is that what you think?"
"All I can do."
"They all needed him."
"You have always been the guardian."
"It's liquid nitrogen."
"We did it for the kids."
"She did it for you."
"I need you too."
"I think he likes you."
"Do you know how I feel?"
"You know how I feel?"
"It is made of liquid metal."
"Do you want me to spy on him?"
"I was called all the time."
"Give her what she wants."
"What did we believe?"
"We'll get them next time."
"Nicky dreamed of another Vegas."
"Maybe because of the headlights."
"And Blue, have you seen him?"
"We have known each other since childhood."
"He came back to life."
"I have my advance coming."
"You don't want to marry me anymore?"
"But I can't."
"We have the lab results."
"Tell me you know."
"Yeah, he told me."
"Do you love me?"
"You haven't thought about it?"
"The police are on the case."
"I forgot to introduce myself."
"That's what's exciting."
"Did he tell you why?"
"I want to talk about it."
"Who told you my name?"
"Tell me what you have."
"For what you have done."
"I have news for you."
"I'll get you something."
"I'll make you some tea."
"I know that's it."
"In the center of the entrance hall."
"Yes, we know who you are."
"I want us to stay together."
"A wonderful thing happened."
"Is there a phone?"
"Well, I found it."
"Didn't we tell you?"
"That is the whole question."
"I think you would like it."
"They must have landed with you."
"You're here early."
"Please, for me."
"Abe has a unique frontal lobe."
"No, I don't think so."
"No, I didn't recognize him."
"Do you want to have breakfast?"
"Please, let's go."
"No, I'll do it myself."
"Put the money in the bag."
"I want you to meet her."
"I want you to hear this."
"That's where I'll be."
"Do you believe in love at first sight?"
"He's leaving the hospital tomorrow."
"Social housing, concrete cages."
"Who has time for that?"
"You didn't ask for it."
"I said that randomly."
"Do you want me to follow him?"
"We'll call you a taxi."
"Do you know who I work for?"
"That's life."
"I want to talk to your father."
"But you need me."
"You have to invite me in."
"What is that smell?"
"Are you happy to see me?"
"And the rest of the crew?"
"Can I see?"
"He's there right now."
"That's it, I got it."
"I know you have them."
"So he knows where you are."
"I'll show you your bed."
"Nobody knows who you are."
"You know what we do?"
"Our Father who art in heaven."
"Do you feel me in your gut?"
"It came suddenly."
"Do you know where the toilets are?"
"It's worth it, I hope."
"I told you to get out of here."
"What is it?"
"You have something to do."
"You think it was me?"
"It's a girls' night out."
"I hope you enjoyed it."
"For now, anyway."
"My wife and I are separated."
"Do you want to talk about something else?"
"I'll take you wherever you want."
"But we brought him back down."
"Will you be there for my birthday?"
"I think I know where to start."
"But that was last night."
"Do you want to measure yourself against me?"
"But she made you laugh."
"Give me a call."
"You never know who's listening."
"In a box, in my office."
"I thought I heard someone."
"They haven't arrived yet."
"It happened all by itself."
"But he wasn't there."
"It's as you feel."
"Tell me how it happened."
"Who did you tell?"
"Everything will be fine, you'll see."
"You have to press the button."
"Do I have your consent to act?"
"There was a knock at the door."
"I was proud of my sentence."
"What if we leave here?"
"You've got yourself all mixed up there."
"I was heartbroken."
"I know you think so."
"Let's give him what he wants."
"I'll tell you a secret."
"There are women here."
"Nobody cares about me."
"One for you, one for me."
"I'll get you a blanket."
"You're not sure."
"It's easier for me."
"And I let her do it."
"How are you feeling, my dear?"
"Do you remember this girl?"
"It's him, is it sure?"
"What are you going to do with her?"
"I have to get back to L.A."
"Do you want me to wake up?"
"I have to go to the office."
"Who asked you to come?"
"Brothers protect each other."
"I saw you do it."
"The time has come to choose."
"Don't you hear a little girl, Frankie?"
"I've had it since this morning."
"You know what I love?"
"Okay, I'll be right there."
"I know what you were doing."
"It's like in life."
"It's part of your charm."
"How did I get here?"
"It's our lot."
"I think I found the solution."
"You look so cute."
"If you don't mind."
"I need to see them."
"Whose turn is it?"
"I need to go."
"Can you lower your voice?"
"Thank you for coming so quickly."
"See you in two days."
"Phone number of the cabin?"
"And there always will be."
"By the way, what's your name?"
"Of course I believe it."
"Every divorced woman has the right to it."
"I need a nitrogen kit."
"I don't know, it depends."
"They are not the only ones."
"You don't know anything about her."
"It's better not to know."
"He is the king of what?"
"It's the present that matters."
"Because you are a man."
"That's a good idea."
"And you, how do you feel?"
"Just what we needed."
"Did you see who it was?"
"Did you see who it was?"
"The keys, please."
"Does it really work?"
"I'm right on time."
"How much time do you have left?"
"I'll take you for a ride."
"In a morgue here in Paris."
"Do you do this all the time?"
"Have you heard from him?"
"I'm lucky, huh?"
"I have a delivery to make."
"No, I don't think so."
"We are glad to see you."
"There's a lot going on."
"Do you want to go to my room?"
"No one is ever safe."
"It just happened like that."
"Children, what are you doing here?"
"I will do it as soon as possible."
"They haven't decided yet."
"I know what it's about."
"I spoke to my lawyer."
"Blessed be the name of the Lord."
"Right place, right time."
"That's why I came back."
"I can go on all day."
"He must be in his room."
"Equips the military clubs of the colonies."
"Because I told them."
"Please call me."
"Did she tell you something?"
"Not one to catch the other."
"I could have done without it."
"I was put under a spell."
"You have a very beautiful smile."
"Do you want it or not?"
"I've thought about your suggestion."
"You go to a lot of places."
"You're right, it's true."
"Honey, go wait for me outside."
"There is plenty to do."
"It's his day off."
"I'll let you rest."
"I was sent after him."
"What is left to say?"
"Are you seasick?"
"Have you cleaned the room yet?"
"She won't make it."
"I'm one step ahead."
"What do you like?"
"An admirable woman, that's for sure."
"I don't know this girl."
"I should have told you."
"I've seen it done before."
"Something I said?"
"What is he drinking?"
"But what happened to him?"
"I like men in uniform."
"What's in it?"
"Someone gave it to you."
"It's up to her to decide, right?"
"Since when has he disappeared?"
"We did everything we could."
"He has plans for you."
"It's moonlight."
"Do you know what they're talking about?"
"That seems like a good idea to me."
"Wait outside, please."
"It's in New Jersey."
"It's her honeymoon."
"Have you ever done this before?"
"I call it what I want."
"What is she up to?"
"There are other reasons."
"I don't want him anymore."
"I've been doing this for years."
"He is a childhood friend."
"It's written on your badge."
"Can you give him a message?"
"All living things look alike."
"They will believe he is there."
"Call me as soon as he arrives."
"That's his way of doing things."
"If you still want me."
"A Coke, please."
"She headed straight to the office."
"What do we look like?"
"This is what we found."
"You have no messages."
"Here's what you're going to do."
"There is much to be gained."
"Yes, that's the correct address."
"It was just for one day."
"We've come a long way together."
"I want what's mine."
"In public, I believe in everyone."
"Thank you for joining us."
"He reminds me of my grandfather."
"I'll keep an eye on him."
"And when did you see me?"
"I don't know anything about that."
"I don't know anything about that."
"Can you lower your voice?"
"Who are you talking to down there?"
"I want a paternity test."
"This is one of our favorites."
"Do you know how to use it?"
"I want to take you somewhere."
"Not if they feel threatened."
"That's what you feel."
"How did the exam go?"
"Do you want something else?"
"I will open the door for you."
"How do you manage to do that?"
"I called you about that."
"I called you about that."
"We take matters into our own hands."
"I can't control her."
"Don't pressure me."
"So what happened to him?"
"They haven't come out yet."
"What does she open?"
"How long will you be here?"
"You got me out of trouble."
"There are so many people."
"It was for a good cause."
"I agree with Stu."
"I can't forgive him."
"I'll write you a prescription."
"But it has to work."
"Where does he work?"
"There has been a break-in."
"He looks very nice."
"Here we are."
"You're unlucky."
"Is it charged?"
"I paid for your breakfast."
"Once or twice a week."
"There is so much to see."
"You never said it."
"What would it look like?"
"Things are as they are."
"You have to try it."
"What is he taking?"
"No, no, it's okay, it's okay."
"It's good to see you again."
"I have a business to propose."
"Have you spoken to anyone?"
"Do you have the balance sheet, Lt?"
"I have to go, goodbye."
"I think he would like it."
"Your name, what were you looking for?"
"Where did you get all this?"
"We have a job for you."
"I know where the key is."
"Oh yes, I'm sure."
"Thanks for putting me here."
"I took care of you."
"He is stronger than you."
"What are you guys talking about?"
"I know who you really are."
"I have to tell you."
"This platform is off-limits to civilians."
"It seems you are looking for me."
"We have some things to sort out."
"We are here to protect you."
"We are here to protect you."
"The Games Brigade is everywhere."
"I was there all the time."
"The last act makes the film."
"Sorry I didn't tell you anything."
"But what is this thing?"
"You won the jackpot."
"I'll get you one."
"Maybe he's gone."
"Sorry, I forgot your name."
"When were you planning to tell me about this?"
"I know you are here."
"What kind of woman are you?"
"What do you smell?"
"There is gold."
"Here, put this in your pocket."
"I assure you, it's true."
"Where is my hairbrush?"
"No, it doesn't work like that."
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"Everyone knows me here."
"Do you have an idea in mind?"
"Would you like to join us?"
"I am proud of all of you."
"I know you loved him."
"What else can we be?"
"I have no defense."
"Thank you for coming tonight."
"He is very proud of you."
"It's been over a month."
"So we go home."
"How convenient for him."
"You are a businessman."
"It's for an appointment."
"You don't even talk to each other anymore."
"Say it a million times."
"What are we celebrating?"
"I'm watching it right now."
"Doc, where is the shooter?"
"You both look pretty."
"I have to get used to it."
"I just need time."
"That was about it."
"It can only please him."
"It's like home."
"Do you need a lawyer?"
"Yeah, you might be right."
"Why are you worrying?"
"Don Ward is very well liked here."
"She's the one who left."
"You have work to do."
"Glad you liked it."
"You are a man of your word."
"I'll pour you a drink."
"Why are you interested in him?"
"Where was she from, Compton?"
"We should see each other more often."
"You don't know his name?"
"He is sleeping."
"Because it doesn't exist."
"No, they are not."
"Yeah, something like that."
"Everything else is up to you."
"They did something to me."
"I have to get up."
"No, I want to be with you."
"Something is going to happen to you."
"No, I've made my decision."
"You never talked about it."
"How was your day?"
"Did you have a good night?"
"It could be anyone."
"Can't hold back?"
"What does she need?"
"What did he do to me?"
"Don't call me that anymore."
"I didn't take them."
"Come have a drink with us."
"There must be a door."
"In the name of Jesus we pray."
"There are tuxedos and there are tuxedos."
"We are on alert."
"I see you know each other."
"I have his cell phone number."
"More beautiful than ever, big sister."
"I have to get back to work."
"Did you put gas in?"
"Does this make sense?"
"I want to be on time."
"How did you get it?"
"It's time to sort this out."
"I'll take one for myself."
"I'll leave the field open to you."
"He was good to me."
"I have a very good memory."
"That's what I'm saying."
"It depends on who you ask."
"This is not an opinion."
"The director is something else."
"Think of something pleasant."
"I'll find out who did this."
"What's his name again?"
"I saw her last night."
"Do you have a room to rent?"
"And the kitchen on your left."
"My father taught me that."
"Are those gunshots?"
"What if he was telling the truth?"
"When were you going to tell me about it?"
"No, it's fine, it's okay."
"She's not upstairs."
"And what happened?"
"He's smarter than that."
"Open it and give it to me."
"And you, what are you doing here?"
"What are you doing here?"
"Actually, it's mine."
"How long can you hold on?"
"Did he stand you up?"
"Please, calm down."
"It can happen anytime."
"I have plans for you."
"I know where I belong."
"I told you to come home."
"Sorry, visit another time."
"Where did you learn this poem?"
"Do you want me to hide?"
"It's stronger than you."
"But you owe me one."
"I might have something."
"I am stronger than you."
"It's about him."
"Did you have a good summer?"
"Someone else will do it."
"What's her name again?"
"She knows we're here."
"And who told you that?"
"I discovered it this morning."
"I made you win big."
"I need an alibi."
"I think he knows."
"I think he knows that."
"Sorry for what happened."
"I have to go to the dentist."
"Is this store yours?"
"It's the best of all possible worlds."
"You took me by surprise."
"I don't belong here."
"Do you remember anything?"
"Hey, I got your message."
"But not by selling secrets."
"I think we got it."
"I was glad to see you."
"How could you think that?"
"I know what they are."
"You have to be strong."
"Can I see you for a moment?"
"Apparently it's good."
"I feel it, I feel it."
"You never loved her."
"It will do him good."
"The keys are in my pocket."
"I'll try it in the kitchen."
"I want to tell you."
"See how easy that was?"
"He asked you a question."
"You're really talking nonsense."
"I'm proud of you, honey."
"She's not for me."
"You'll have it next week."
"You want to know where I was?"
"I tried to reason with her."
"Something like that."
"It seems to be stopping."
"But he's a good boy."
"No one can survive this."
"What do you have your eye on?"
"She gave me the key."
"He loved you like a son."
"I wonder who it was."
"I guess you're right."
"Here, drink some water."
"I'm starting to see things clearly."
"You don't want to go back?"
"This is a gift for you."
"How do you want this to work?"
"No, I have too much work."
"I just feel it."
"You should take a look at it."
"That's what they want."
"How could you do that?"
"I came to get my things."
"It's not drugs."
"He is happy to see you."
"He is still in the hospital."
"It was a good day."
"He knew what kind of man you would become."
"I left her there."
"You used her."
"I'm glad to see you again."
"I understand what you are going through."
"I'll ask you the question again."
"Is this serious?"
"You should never do that."
"You look like you're going to throw up."
"I'm going to get out of here."
"Do you have feelings for her?"
"Just the ones you give me."
"There are a lot of cars."
"Shall I walk you to your car?"
"I found out this morning."
"That's what I like."
"No, that's not correct."
"We'll be there for tea."
"I almost shot you."
"Please calm down."
"He lives in another world."
"I take care of the press."
"Do we really have to talk about this?"
"No, everyone loved him."
"It had to happen."
"Let's see if I get an address."
"What are you trying to tell me?"
"I need to have a drink."
"I have to go to class."
"How am I going to get out of this?"
"I need your services."
"Haven't you changed your mind?"
"I was next to him."
"It feels like a dream."
"You don't believe in ghosts?"
"What can you do for me?"
"It's going to take me some time."
"You can't think that."
"He's a man, a real one."
"And what about you?"
"Now you."
"Where is the ransom demand?"
"I told him what to do."
"Your father was a great man."
"I never knew her."
"Tell him what you want."
"She's on the other line."
"Is this Doug's mattress?"
"You have a job to do."
"It was nice to meet you."
"She didn't come here."
"Do you have an ID?"
"What did you think it was?"
"We are very close to the goal."
"I sent her flowers."
"Can we talk?"
"Tell him to come see me."
"What do you see coming for you?"
"I had to make a decision."
"We will do what we can."
"Yes, that's my real name."
"I gave him the day off."
"I wish you were here."
"So you're talking nonsense."
"He is younger than me."
"Where did you learn English?"
"Won't you buy me a drink?"
"I will be back very soon."
"Do you want to train?"
"Who is in charge of the case?"
"I'm starting to feel better."
"Did the team get their share?"
"I know, I'll take care of it."
"I saw your lightsaber."
"They never did."
"Did you go through my bag?"
"I have lucky pills."
"I must be punished."
"Eat while it's hot."
"Eat while it's hot."
"Something just happened."
"Can anyone hear me?"
"It's all my business now."
"I thought you understood."
"I'm going to surprise him."
"I'll be right back, okay?"
"I gave him a name."
"I wanted to go home."
"You'll have to do better than that."
"See how easy it is?"
"No one has heard of it."
"What a beautiful job you did."
"You've seen through me."
"It's a woman."
"What else are they used for?"
"Well, that looks good."
"Do you want me to stay here?"
"Maybe he is."
"They asked who you were?"
"I thought you'd like that."
"It's still a little early."
"Nature abhors a vacuum."
"Can we do something about it?"
"You weren't there."
"Did you see him this morning?"
"What are you doing this weekend?"
"Do you want to come up for a drink?"
"You've gotten ahead of yourself."
"I wanted to ask you something."
"Maybe he's a cop."
"It went well, huh?"
"You know I am."
"But what would I do there?"
"We have to take him to the hospital."
"We need to take him to the hospital."
"Everyone has a father."
"I'll get us out of here."
"Is that what you like?"
"But how did he do it?"
"Because I really love you."
"She only talks about that."
"It's time to get ready."
"You look good to me."
"You have something special."
"How long has it been?"
"You don't like women?"
"I came to return this to you."
"I left home."
"I will try to reach him."
"You are just like everyone else."
"Do you want a ride?"
"I was on television."
"Everything you will need."
"Who is in charge of the investigation?"
"I can't, guys."
"I have a lot of free time."
"It's in both your names."
"How do you manage to do that?"
"Do you promise not to say anything?"
"Do you want a cereal bar?"
"I knew you were there."
"There is one now."
"I did a little research."
"She knows what I'm talking about."
"They have already experienced war."
"He needs his medication."
"She didn't want to say anything."
"I always tell you the truth."
"A world united and at peace."
"And now what are you going to do?"
"Whose all this is?"
"Can you give us a minute?"
"Enjoy it while it lasts."
"You know where the bar is."
"You hide in broad daylight."
"They are both here."
"And yet you defended him."
"Do you know where she went?"
"Let's see what I can find."
"I'm clean, you know that."
"I look forward to reading from you."
"Haven't you seen them?"
"The Guardians are a thing of the past."
"I always liked him."
"You must trust me."
"I have to hide."
"Look like you're having fun."
"What are you looking for?"
"It will be a bloodbath."
"Someone else is needed."
"What do you want them to do?"
"Do you have a driver's license?"
"Would you please please me?"
"He is suspected in the robbery."
"Because you're hiding it from him."
"I can buy you, sell you."
"How long can we hold out?"
"Who left the door open?"
"I have many friends here."
"What would you be able to do?"
"Nice to meet you."
"It's good to be free."
"I have to finish this."
"We have a new king now."
"In my soul, Italian cinema."
"But everything went well."
"I know you are close."
"You know what I would like?"
"Please be careful."
"Please be careful."
"No one can resist Rome."
"Don't hesitate to ask me."
"She didn't say no."
"Who disagrees?"
"No, I don't trust it."
"There is a lot of money."
"A real little genius in science."
"It is not a cure."
"How should I tell you?"
"But they are not there."
"I haven't left yet."
"But it's the same thing."
"You've never done this?"
"I had an appointment with him."
"That's where they are."
"It's okay, I saw it."
"The whole world knows."
"Things happened."
"I need two men."
"I turned my back on him."
"There are many things."
"He was right about you."
"We should take a step back."
"But a small party, OK?"
"You didn't need to."
"Would you like to leave him a message?"
"This is Colonel Douglas Mortimer."
"You know guns are circulating."
"It's probably better this way."
"What does this make you think of?"
"I'll come when I'm ready."
"Thank you both."
"You knew this was coming."
"You are doing a very good job."
"I want to go back to my cell."
"I have an offer for you."
"Take the time you need."
"I want to open your eyes."
"It's a family story."
"Is this what I think?"
"I'm glad to hear that."
"Do you want a ride?"
"Because you're taking that plane."
"I think I saw something."
"But you're not there yet."
"I want you to be."
"He was younger than me."
"What is your name, my dear?"
"Do you like it?"
"He took my hand."
"What's in the box?"
"I risk my life for you."
"She closed her bank account."
"Tell him I'm here."
"What is what?"
"You must have done something."
"How did you get here so quickly?"
"I have a life, you know."
"I would bet my life on it."
"Knowledge is power."
"I need to speak to your boss."
"Ray with his hockey stick."
"I thought you knew me."
"My wife is still expecting a child."
"What does this imply?"
"I'll get a bowl first."
"There's a draft."
"Sorry for doubting you."
"How many people is this for?"
"I thought it was obvious."
"Because he tells the truth."
"Did he tell you anything else?"
"Just so you know."
"Guess what I found."
"The bathroom is there."
"What do you want from me exactly?"
"I am honored to meet you."
"We do it my way."
"Thanks for the call."
"Are you insured for life?"
"The world is really small here."
"I'll get through this on my own."
"What's the point of all this?"
"What are you driving?"
"This is a very good start."
"I knew we would understand each other."
"You wanted to tell me something."
"It's because of work."
"Is everyone settled in?"
"I always wanted a child."
"They must have changed their minds."
"We received it this morning."
"What's going on there?"
"This is where it all begins."
"What everyone wants."
"Can I ask you a favor?"
"Do I have time to eat?"
"Don't ask me any more."
"No need to go into details."
"What do you want me to say?"
"So, shall I take the wheel?"
"No, that won't do."
"No, don't tell me."
"What were you reading?"
"She must be around."
"Look on the bright side."
"I've heard this story before."
"Tell us a little about yourself."
"He never did that."
"You don't have a name?"
"Any idea who it is?"
"Have you ever seen a portal?"
"I don't have a story."
"A straight guy, like his father."
"This is what you should do."
"This is what you should do."
"He's a very good boy."
"You'll have it on your conscience."
"I'll get her myself."
"I was just a kid."
"I know almost everything about you."
"And what does that mean?"
"Give him a hand."
"They are not all."
"I thought we were partners."
"We'll just take a look."
"How am I supposed to know?"
"Where did you get that from?"
"Do you know what you're becoming?"
"I want to be more than that."
"I live here day and night."
"I was on the other side."
"Of course I'll come."
"Where did you find all this?"
"Where did you find all this?"
"I may have done it."
"It only happens in the movies."
"Maybe we could go there."
"You should have seen his face."
"Can I offer you a coffee?"
"How did you get on?"
"I'm going to ask you something."
"It's plant-based."
"I want to know where he's going."
"It can only be you."
"I knew he would go far."
"You have domestic responsibilities."
"It will be up to you to decide."
"I have the marriage contract."
"This is the bedroom."
"I come here every day."
"He took hold of you."
"Come on, we're going to have fun."
"I'd love a cup of that."
"Let me give you my card."
"Isn't that your husband?"
"What does she say in her letter?"
"You don't have anything planned?"
"Brendan Harris passed the test."
"There is still time."
"I think it's Frankie."
"Did you need to say that?"
"My mother left for Christmas."
"Do you see that tree over there?"
"Ask Polly to write them down."
"I'm glad you're back."
"What's going on, man?"
"See you inside."
"I bought it for you."
"I am a nice person."
"I gave him the evening off."
"I'm not even going to ask."
"We'll talk about it when I get back."
"That's kind of the point."
"I take care of the house."
"Because she had a lover."
"One moment, please."
"Of course he's fine."
"She will take you to the shrink."
"What excites you?"
"What do you know about life?"
"She was going to dinner with friends."
"We saw each other this morning."
"I feel better like this."
"I think you'll like it."
"We use the saw."
"But there is more important."
"I wanted to prepare some for myself."
"I owe them money."
"He has something to say."
"I thought everything was settled."
"Okay, here we go."
"And you, you call home."
"Is this a job interview?"
"I am not the father."
"I overreacted."
"Thank you for agreeing to see me."
"Is that not your opinion?"
"He gets that from his mother."
"It's better, it's better."
"We'll talk about it again when I get back."
"This is new to me too."
"They're stuck in your hair."
"I know how to get out of here."
"We may be the last."
"There is still one more test."
"But let's not talk about that."
"Have you had breakfast?"
"I'll clear all that out."
"Let's start with something simple."
"What year were you born?"
"I am his unofficial photographer."
"We saw light."
"Do you want to go all the way?"
"You didn't know him."
"I want you to keep this."
"What will it look like?"
"Thank you for coming back for me."
"Who would have believed such a thing?"
"I never use it."
"Come on, I'll buy you a drink."
"I guess you know that."
"After what you did?"
"She won't last the night."
"He proposed to her."
"Yes, that rings a bell."
"He has a hangover."
"I left them a message."
"It's a boy's name."
"Be careful what you ask for."
"I will never speak to him again."
"But you're not anymore."
"I said it first."
"He wants to tell you something."
"You have the right to know."
"You have to remember."
"Do you know about this?"
"No, I'm sure not."
"No, I'm sure not."
"Can't we go somewhere else?"
"Turn around as soon as possible."
"And that's my last word."
"Do you know anything about electricity?"
"I can smell it from here."
"No, you weren't."
"I see the face of God."
"I have feelings for you."
"You have a very special purpose."
"I've read a lot about you."
"Do you see this manhole cover?"
"Maybe I should do that."
"Now you know where he lives."
"You asked me a question."
"Often, we learn to love it."
"Do you know what you want?"
"I would like to ask you a favor."
"And that doesn't bother you?"
"I just wanted to tell you that."
"And I must do the same."
"It rained all week."
"Do you know where he is now?"
"It has been closed for years."
"I want to know who they are."
"I'll leave him a message."
"Will we let them defend themselves?"
"I hope it's good."
"You can forget about it."
"A man goes to the doctor."
"Take it off, please."
"Always there to watch over you."
"There must be a clue."
"That's it, let's go."
"The master must preserve his strength."
"Is it worth it?"
"You are as white as a sheet."
"Is that where they're going?"
"Please hurry up."
"What are all these questions?"
"With the arrival of a new one?"
"Not even a phone call."
"Is there a solution?"
"Or we want to make people believe it."
"They never married."
"He is a very nice boy."
"I knew you would have it."
"Are there any other questions?"
"I'll borrow it for a second."
"I want to see what it's like."
"You were a good father."
"Do you remember your promise?"
"I came to talk to you."
"In the end, we collect everything."
"You told me to leave."
"Close your doors, go home."
"I think it's doable."
"We still have a lot to do."
"You need to take your mind off things."
"The Force is powerful within him."
"I think it's serious."
"What does he say?"
"What are you asking?"
"The corner table is ready."
"I understand what you are going through."
"There are a lot of children."
"What happened there?"
"Give them some time."
"But we got through it."
"About a year ago."
"What were we doing?"
"Did she give you any diseases?"
"That's the good life."
"No, it's quite the opposite."
"You did a great job."
"Maybe I should talk to him."
"How can he do this to me?"
"Or we'll never see each other again."
"I'll know more there."
"We'll meet at the station."
"Leave him out of it."
"But no one had seen anything."
"Glad to hear you say that."
"You've been saying that for years."
"You know the drill."
"Maybe I misheard."
"I'll come back tomorrow after work."
"You just arrived."
"I need the address."
"This way, please."
"I have to lead my own life."
"I could have been someone."
"I have to read it."
"Do you know what they are?"
"I thought I could trust you."
"You can be proud of yourself."
"I'm going to go for a little walk."
"Uh, I'll be right back."
"You're not a kid anymore."
"We have our whole lives ahead of us."
"I am God's instrument."
"We live from day to day."
"Explain the blood stains to us."
"You don't love me now."
"He made advances towards me."
"You can be honest with me."
"I'm on the verge of tears."
"And to enjoy life."
"Celeste is a gift from heaven."
"Come see what I'm doing."
"Because I asked for it."
"Don't get me started on that last one."
"Not if I stop him."
"Nobody can do anything for me."
"I know you have some."
"It seems like he knows everything."
"Do you really want to investigate him?"
"What business brings you to Bree?"
"What is he up to?"
"And who is the lucky one?"
"Let me tell you about him."
"It is a model of elegance."
"They didn't do anything to you?"
"Is your mom home?"
"And you are my best friend."
"What happened to the boys?"
"I really have to go home."
"What can you do for me?"
"A juicy investment for these guys."
"This is a free subtitle."
"There must be some logic."
"We'll talk about it another time."
"What I have to do."
"Did he come out without your knowledge?"
"This is the service entrance."
"It will be used for the fence."
"Let me explain the situation to you."
"It's a guesthouse."
"That's very kind of you."
"Okay, do as you wish."
"It will never happen again."
"You're right, it's true."
"We have to find her."
"You must be proud of her."
"Yes, I completely understand."
"How can I be sure?"
"I understand his point of view."
"Someone did this to me."
"It's dark."
"I know who the father is."
"What did I look like?"
"No, no, I don't think so."
"It's written on the box."
"You have to crawl at his feet."
"A woman like I like them."
"I spent the day here."
"What will happen now?"
"I can't think about it."
"Yes, I'll be right back."
"I want you to be beautiful."
"No, we're going home."
"I took care of you."
"We removed this bullet."
"I just had a baby."
"How long do we have to wait?"
"Tonight is a big night."
"You would have done the same for me."
"Do you really think you know your wife?"
"Maybe it's better this way."
"Do you have what I want?"
"Hey, you can't come in."
"Thank you for picking me up."
"They argued all the time."
"Do you think I want it?"
"There always have been."
"I could use a drink."
"There was something else."
"I can read lips."
"I'm taking you to the doctor."
"It was about you."
"Have you ever thought about that?"
"But I have to earn a living."
"That's what he was."
"Samuel, what time could it be?"
"Do you know what we are?"
"Nobody knows where I am."
"I would love for you to come."
"Not since we were kids."
"No, don't touch that."
"By this ring, I marry you."
"The school is closed due to flooding."
"I've never seen you before."
"I know what I like."
"I'll do you a favor."
"You have to accept it."
"You are taken to the border."
"Can you do something about it?"
"Of course you want to."
"I think she knows that."
"You are good with numbers."
"There is traffic."
"There will be plenty of singles."
"He'll have to find me first."
"Would you like a glass of water?"
"They cut up the whole country."
"Can I get you a drink?"
"That's not mine."
"They took my grandson."
"That's it, see you next time."
"Everything will be fixed in a moment."
"My love, what should I do?"
"Thank you, Mr. Owl."
"I love you too, sweetie."
"Is your father at home?"
"That's the dog's name."
"There are other survivors."
"Did you mention our outing?"
"Can I talk to him in private?"
"I want something special."
"Anyone else want to try?"
"You were perfect tonight."
"It's Chinese to me."
"Dad, what happened?"
"Okay, I'll see you later."
"Twice the size of Texas."
"I have some catching up to do."
"I can't think anymore."
"I waited all morning."
"No, you can't leave."
"These are just numbers."
"Is someone taking care of you?"
"You don't have a job?"
"When is the wedding?"
"I don't dare say it."
"I knew you'd like her."
"What should I do with him?"
"I'd better leave you."
"I'll come back and see you later."
"Could you take me home?"
"How do you know who I am?"
"You're smarter than that."
"No, it's not for me."
"I have a stitch in my side."
"Where is the justice in that?"
"I'm good for nothing."
"I didn't push her."
"You know what's amazing?"
"Do you want us to work together?"
"Please be careful."
"Exactly what I was going to say."
"No, you won't."
"This is for you, my love."
"Nobody knows it exists."
"Where are you going to find the wheat?"
"I wanted him to be happy."
"You're going to suffer later."
"I went out to get some fresh air."
"You remember my name."
"There is a pregnant woman."
"Nobody knows where you are."
"Take these documents to accounting."
"You got it everywhere."
"It's like school."
"Give me the money, so I can go home."
"We are no longer in theory."
"Thank you for staying with me."
"A trigger-happy ex."
"Are you not comfortable here?"
"I brought him a sandwich."
"I studied all night."
"Do you have someone in mind?"
"I thought about that too."
"That's what I do."
"The path through the marshes."
"It's just a coincidence."
"I'll take that as a compliment."
"This is what you chose."
"Something happened to them."
"It's my job to know."
"It's wonderful to see you again."
"It was time to leave."
"I'll make an exception for you."
"She's at the end of the corridor."
"You never had it."
"So you don't see it?"
"He could be anyone."
"What is it?"
"It was worth the wait."
"You want them to love you."
"Keep your eyes fixed on me."
"I don't really remember."
"Did you have a good trip?"
"Maybe I would be happier."
"We all need love."
"I know what you have."
"I'm going, it's late."
"There are some in there."
"When did you arrive on Earth?"
"Where did he find it?"
"He's just an old friend."
"I would like to talk to someone."
"He sleeps in the cauliflowers."
"You have to tell me more."
"I knew I would make it."
"The master is watching over us now."
"Can't you talk to him?"
"Who does this kind of thing?"
"I left them a note."
"She did a good job."
"Hello, what can I do for you?"
"Call us if you need anything."
"For the rest of your life."
"Almost a month ago."
"Energy level close to maximum."
"Tell everyone."
"She gets that from her father."
"I have to give him something."
"What are all these people doing here?"
"No, we won't."
"There's going to be a storm."
"I wish I had done more."
"This guy didn't pay."
"Did you love him?"
"What kind of man was he?"
"Do you have a permit for this?"
"I use it all the time."
"Please come in."
"I've been in compliance since I got out."
"I want him arrested."
"I'll keep an eye on you."
"This is Doug's cell phone."
"We should have suspected it."
"I have work to do."
"I thought it was good."
"What do you mean, you don't know anything?"
"My father was in finance."
"For the theft of the car."
"It's absolutely incredible."
"What if I were one?"
"Can you ask for a large bag?"
"Nothing more to press."
"They are not friends."
"I think this belongs to you."
"What do I feel?"
"This is what we have."
"And you weren't there."
"I like the view from here."
"Did you see him last night?"
"You're a tough cookie."
"It's a very good school."
"It's good to be home."
"I'm a simple guy."
"I want you to see me."
"What is the agenda?"
"She doesn't have a bra."
"How did you get here?"
"By the way, how is he?"
"I had the same idea."
"You can trust no one."
"You could have told me about it."
"What would he do?"
"Who do you think this is?"
"The Master did not ask."
"I'll tell him myself."
"I enjoy watching you work, Howard."
"She did it all by herself."
"Sorry for doubting you."
"I'll wait until you're finished."
"You are free as a bird."
"Shall we put on some music?"
"I can take you to him."
"I'll give you one."
"I know what you're going through."
"I have to go myself."
"Despite the events in Monaco."
"You had nothing to do with it."
"It will cover my son's."
"I'll send you some money."
"I was a good mother."
"I know what I would do."
"We came as soon as possible."
"It's worth a look."
"You would have been proud of me."
"I met her last night."
"How many bullets did you take?"
"I have a good idea."
"Please give me a sign."
"I built this for you."
"We're in this together."
"I think we understand each other."
"What did she do to me?"
"Do you mean what you say?"
"I can do a presentation, not a demonstration."
"I think it belongs to you."
"He's trying to say something."
"Have you spoken to anyone?"
"In the middle of the night?"
"She's not your mother anymore."
"Go down to the access ramp."
"You don't have any parents?"
"How long do you plan to go?"
"You know that, right?"
"She was seeing someone else."
"How do you think I'm doing?"
"Everyone has to go."
"Do we have time for that?"
"I have a good one."
"Don't play his game."
"She has some information inside her."
"Are you in love with a girl?"
"On my way to prom."
"Do I understand correctly?"
"But what can I do about it?"
"Do you really want to talk about this?"
"Come here, please."
"He's a bounty hunter."
"I have this thing to do."
"Can anyone confirm this?"
"You will earn your living with pride."
"How did they finance the pyramids?"
"I dedicated my life to him."
"Let's see what we have."
"A good excuse to go back."
"What's in your mouth?"
"They might have the phone."
"Everyone here knows him."
"No, we don't have time."
"That's the real reason."
"That's enough for now."
"You shouldn't be here."
"Is there a doctor here?"
"We will do what we can."
"One hour there, one hour back."
"I like to start with dessert."
"She wanted to find her little girl."
"They are not vampires."
"What are you singing?"
"What would you do in my place?"
"I think I can handle it."
"I know exactly where she is."
"It's a very pretty dress."
"I want to know everything about her."
"I won the lottery."
"Who are you to say that?"
"From front to back."
"The best there is."
"She can't do it."
"But that's out of the question."
"We need to clear this up."
"I don't speak German."
"But please read."
"You are one of them."
"Better luck next time."
"I have to be there."
"Have you nothing to say?"
"You have no faith."
"I have a suggestion to make."
"You know what I would like?"
"But there is a solution."
"You can go home now."
"I got a good deal."
"Just a little bit of your time."
"There's a reason for everything."
"He came back up to the surface."
"Did you want to ask me something?"
"Did you want to ask me something?"
"I can't accept them."
"These Jews stick together."
"She cut both arteries."
"I didn't find them."
"You're in it up to your neck."
"Let me take care of everything."
"I hope we can make it."
"Well, good for you."
"You always take care of everything."
"I know I would."
"I know, it's going to be hard."
"She will take care of you."
"What did I force you to do?"
"It took me years."
"There will be people there."
"His place is among his people."
"She has something special."
"I'm going to get to work."
"And he has other relatives."
"Do you remember the time?"
"I had to tell him."
"It was nice to see you again."
"She gets on my nerves."
"What do they make you think of?"
"My grandparents raised me."
"It's a countdown."
"He's just a friend."
"She has a brain tumor."
"Can you just make them say hello?"
"What's amazing?"
"And his father, before me."
"She wanted to tell you something."
"Do you see what she's doing?"
"More than a delivery box."
"It's love at first sight."
"Show him who's boss."
"Please, this way."
"I have to talk about it."
"Where is the control room?"
"I will be there all the time."
"She asks you to call her back."
"Got you good, huh?"
"Put them back when you're done."
"Next time start with this."
"Whatever their dad did."
"You will have what is due to you."
"I'm glad to meet you."
"Looks like I won."
"No one has to know."
"It seems to be working."
"I like a job well done."
"Of course I came."
"You've never seen me."
"Are there any witnesses?"
"See you at the meeting."
"You would have done it for me."
"Do you know where he is?"
"I hid something from you."
"The little witch will catch you."
"No point in thinking about it."
"What do you guys think?"
"You know I love him."
"He never loved me."
"Do you see this gorgeous supermodel?"
"What do you want to do tonight?"
"Is this a game for you?"
"I think we're done."
"There is a better way."
"They must not find it."
"How many other Jedi survived?"
"I'll sort this out myself."
"You can never plan for everything."
"You don't need me anymore?"
"Can you go all the way?"
"His daughter must have taken after him."
"She's a little late."
"His son was dating the victim."
"But we will never know."
"Did he add anything?"
"Have you spoken to my father?"
"He has a cast-iron alibi."
"I see you all the time."
"No, it's mine."
"I'll take that as a yes."
"What did you want?"
"I'm talking about you and me."
"Go home, have a drink."
"Where did you go Spider-Man?"
"I was out all night."
"How are you going to get through this?"
"The entire spectrum of human emotions."
"Where have I seen you before?"
"You are so much more than that."
"But why did you do that?"
"Look at what you have accomplished."
"Are you sure this will work?"
"Do you still think about girls a lot?"
"It was Joshua who called."
"Not that, please."
"I take what I can."
"You will be a great Jedi Knight."
"I'll see you at the hospital."
"I don't take it personally."
"But do you remember my costume?"
"This is the appropriate term."
"I try to make myself useful."
"This is a non-smoking area."
"You have to keep a cool head."
"Have you tried calling him?"
"You slept with my mother."
"Is that what you like?"
"Stay a minute if you can."
"I thought you wanted to talk."
"Take care of the Jedi first."
"We were lucky."
"What did she believe?"
"That's good, that's great."
"Why are you so sure?"
"I've been waiting for you for an hour."
"In case something happens."
"She takes care of the other two."
"I just want you to leave."
"I'm on the right track."
"She is very proud of you."
"You make a very beautiful couple."
"Do you have one for me?"
"There's only her."
"It can be any."
"I don't need them."
"Like you always have."
"What's the good news?"
"God has answered your prayers."
"It is the hand of God."
"Do what needs to be done."
"It's supposed to be like this."
"I brought some food."
"There must be a reason."
"I'm going to walk a little longer."
"They are taller than me."
"The Creator did not respond."
"I asked him to pay."
"Do you see the tree over there?"
"He made fun of you."
"We have our driving license."
"She's going to marry another one."
"I had to take care of it."
"How can you live like this?"
"There are surely others."
"I had a good idea."
"Sorry about the other day."
"I want you to get better."
"How much will it cost for the work?"
"You're not sure."
"I think you'll like it."
"Put my decorations on my chest."
"Do you think you're a hero?"
"It's Mrs. Chan's."
"I do everything."
"Let them taste Roman steel."
"She will want to go to him."
"Here we go, let's go."
"It is a sign from Apollo."
"A single flow, from the girl."
"It looks like that's it."
"Neighbors reported the smell."
"She didn't answer me."
"We have a gift for you."
"Everyone has someone."
"I've been here for an hour."
"And you know it very well."
"She had hotel numbers."
"No, it's not sure."
"Neither the photos nor the cops."
"She's not mine anymore."
"Of course you're here."
"How long will it take?"
"Yes, this is the right address."
"What have you gotten me into?"
"The key is under the doormat."
"We have a train to catch."
"What did you do there?"
"Yeah, I saw the body."
"Is that the good news?"
"Panama is a friendly country."
"And what is his name?"
"See you this weekend?"
"It's not just anything."
"You didn't sleep with her?"
"What kind of business is this?"
"I'll take a look around."
"I think everything has changed."
"It all started with gangs."
"The further away the better."
"How many drinks did you have?"
"Whatever you want, darling."
"Would you mind repeating that for me?"
"Maybe it was a cat."
"That's what you like."
"You never go home?"
"Your face looks familiar."
"Don't you want to come with me?"
"Guys, what is this?"
"That's what he would like."
"That's a good dog."
"All right, I'll go."
"Don't tell anyone about this."
"I don't know anything about it."
"Tell me, please."
"Everyone is on edge."
"That leaves us little time."
"I've always loved this photo."
"Thanks to him, you are here."
"I would have come back before he woke up."
"Your Honor, please."
"And it is truly a pleasure."
"I can't swallow this."
"He is taller than you."
"How can I be sure?"
"Call Mrs. Chan for me."
"We have to go home."
"Do you know what it's for?"
"I told you the rest."
"You hid things from me."
"He was in the back seat."
"I'll see you when you get back."
"I'm going to say goodbye to him."
"Because you're a girl."
"I am given a symbolic burial."
"He can take care of himself."
"Are you coming to my party tomorrow?"
"Except your uncle and aunt."
"If I can, I will."
"Did you have a good evening?"
"That's okay, that's okay."
"No, that's not his style."
"This bar has always been my thing."
"It shows on your face."
"I saw you with him."
"I'll give you five dollars for it."
"Do whatever it takes."
"I'll save some for dinner."
"You don't read the press?"
"It's for underwear."
"You were only six years old."
"Maybe we should talk about this."
"What do you understand?"
"I have to stay here."
"I feel so much better now."
"Your son needs you."
"Could you teach him a lesson?"
"Would you do something for me?"
"No, because no one will know."
"Other things come into play."
"You've already done a lot."
"Everyday wine."
"No, that won't be necessary."
"He comes from time to time."
"From a legal point of view."
"I wondered who it was."
"I'd better stay."
"I can't hear that."
"That's what's good."
"Did she do well?"
"But one thing at a time."
"You mustn't say that."
"Do you want to talk to him?"
"It's part of the experience."
"It's like I said."
"He is the key to everything."
"He came to my cell."
"Did she talk about me?"
"I had a wonderful evening."
"Your neighbor is Al Capone."
"A great battle in the old days."
"It's a little bit better."
"Does it make a difference to her?"
"Something extraordinary has happened."
"It must happen all the time."
"No, we've already talked about it."
"Can I trust you?"
"Did you look under the bed?"
"I did a good job."
"I play it all the time."
"Can we get back to work?"
"It's about your life."
"I need your impression."
"I knew you loved me."
"Do you have jumper cables?"
"That's what friends are for."
"She stays because she still hopes."
"That's the whole point."
"Did you forget something?"
"I can't ask him."
"Come with me, please."
"They took my son from me."
"You see this cigar box."
"He did this for me."
"I have to ask you."
"Yet I intend to."
"Do you think I would do that?"
"She didn't want to come."
"I release you from this spell."
"What was the agreed price?"
"Do you think she'll come back?"
"Are you doing it right now?"
"Ready to make history?"
"When were you going to tell me?"
"No, it won't."
"I don't have an accent."
"Can I call you later?"
"But God had other plans."
"You shouldn't say it."
"I'll make you one."
"I'm proud of you, Vincent."
"She's worth her weight in gold."
"I know guys like you."
"I slept in."
"What do you know about the subject?"
"I tried to warn him."
"That I was a good guy."
"This is the last time, understand?"
"You never said that."
"How did he get into the scene?"
"Can I confess something to you?"
"You forgot how we work."
"I went looking for him."
"No, you've come to the right place."
"He reminds me of you."
"Maybe it's a code."
"Open your eyes and close your eyes."
"We will do everything possible."
"Like all exceptional men."
"I was wondering when you would come."
"What kind of car was it?"
"You have done so much for me."
"You and I, it's over."
"I'm here because of you."
"I'm looking for his schedule."
"That's kind of him."
"Do you want me to read it?"
"About the time of your return."
"All the white people are leaving."
"It's a lifestyle choice."
"Give him a call."
"I left the window open."
"I'll get something later."
"It's a power game."
"She gave me her card."
"What should we do with him?"
"I don't want to hide."
"Have you ever been shot?"
"Oh yes, oh yes yes yes."
"Maybe in another color?"
"Everyone in the car."
"I know how it happened."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated."
"I need a nap."
"I know how to take care of you."
"Who just moved in next door?"
"Thank you for your kindness."
"This is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes."
"Is this what awaits us?"
"It's full of thieves here."
"Do you remember this movie?"
"You could have come to see me."
"I had no one else."
"I was told to come."
"But the answer might be."
"She is already in her future."
"She must be inside."
"I asked you something."
"She did it for me."
"I think he believes it."
"What are you asking me to do?"
"From Fox leader to Fox group."
"My God, what have we done?"
"Do I have one, at least?"
"You never told me that."
"Do you remember his name?"
"What's your nickname?"
"I think it was him."
"For the same reason as me."
"You are the one who is."
"That's another story."
"See you later then."
"See you later then."
"I swear it's true."
"Come see me before you leave."
"No, thank you, my dear."
"Do what you know how to do."
"Tell me where my son is."
"Some are stronger than me."
"I'll put someone on it."
"Every time it's the same."
"They're everywhere here."
"I have to make money."
"How long has it been, seven, eight years?"
"We still need him."
"And my successor is you."
"Son, let Mom and Dad talk."
"I never saw them again."
"One more day in paradise."
"It's the job that comes in."
"I'll be there in two hours."
"The city that never sleeps."
"Look, this is the new model."
"He is a very good friend."
"Are you back in town?"
"Alexander the Great, as you say."
"You will truly be able to work in peace."
"Can I send him a message?"
"The house pays."
"A man like I like them."
"What do you think about this idea?"
"I still like you."
"I heard about him."
"She's a porn star."
"I knew you would be interested."
"I have a call for you."
"I would like to ask you something."
"I needed a drink."
"I want what I want."
"She's there, behind my elbow."
"You've never met her."
"Take some time to think about it."
"Don't try to find me."
"You're on the right track."
"There must be witnesses."
"No, I really have to go."
"They put on a show."
"Could you make less noise?"
"She wanted me to do it."
"At the cost of so many lives."
"Should I take them in different colors?"
"What if it wasn't him?"
"It's not yours."
"Is your dad home?"
"He has a kind of mask."
"I am one of your fans."
"Well, how are you feeling?"
"Everything she needs."
"I'll introduce you to my friends."
"I knew her when she was a kid."
"What if she was telling the truth?"
"It's just a toy."
"You can join her at the restaurant."
"I'm just a soldier."
"See you in a few days."
"Shall we postpone this?"
"You have to be patient."
"How many fingers do I show you?"
"We have a lot in common."
"We have a lot in common."
"How many men do you need?"
"I just had a vision."
"I'm not anymore."
"Let this be the last time."
"I made you dinner."
"Because it's my job."
"This is what I want to know."
"What kind of friend are you?"
"Let me have a good nap."
"What will change?"
"She asks you to hurry up."
"We'll give you something to eat."
"Please be careful."
"Maybe it's final."
"I made you an offer."
"The solution had always been there."
"What did you do last night?"
"What are you doing out so late?"
"I wonder the same thing."
"You're putting me on the street."
"She gave me three."
"We had a great day."
"Tire tracks on a burst belly."
"We need the space."
"I will refund you as soon as possible."
"You have to find the right balance."
"Where did you learn to cook?"
"When did you tell me that?"
"It was with good intentions."
"She will never be beautiful again."
"I sent you a text."
"Do you think he's right?"
"And everything will be fine."
"There are other men."
"Do you want to have breakfast?"
"Isn't that the point?"
"We just look at each other."
"This is all new to me."
"What should I do with this?"
"With the person of my choice."
"We never see his face."
"What does this mean for us?"
"They only see the future."
"I paint, I do things."
"There is something here."
"I'll show you a picture."
"I'm going to stay home."
"People have short memories."
"I can be whoever I want."
"Who loves you more than me?"
"I had to go."
"I hope you are feeling better."
"Give me some money."
"Who should I trust?"
"I thought you were gone."
"She couldn't disappear."
"I went to the clinic."
"He was a very good man."
"I can get you out of here."
"I've never read them."
"That's all I have left."
"After you, please."
"How did school go?"
"I thought he loved me."
"I just know him."
"I'm playing."
"I think we need to talk."
"I bought him some clothes."
"I'm going to have to call the police."
"It's kind of my specialty."
"Don't you want anything else?"
"Was it a farewell dinner?"
"As much as you can give me."
"Sir, what's going on?"
"Give me a minute or two."
"I'll meet you at the hotel."
"I would never have done it."
"This is tomorrow's newspaper."
"You're holding it upside down."
"Lord, what happened to you?"
"I thought she was gone."
"Do we really need this?"
"No, he wasn't there."
"I know where to find one."
"His private life belonged to the public."
"I should go see that."
"I have to be ready for anything."
"It just came to me."
"Do you see that woman over there?"
"How did you get through security?"
"I have a son, too."
"All right, keep me posted."
"We need to explain ourselves."
"I want to talk to him first."
"Serves me right."
"What do you say, Jedi Master?"
"It's better than the subway."
"It's all over the air."
"I could cut my hair."
"Don't ask me for more."
"They told me to wait."
"I need proof."
"Tell me I'm right."
"But I have to do something."
"We are part of the tribe."
"But you don't."
"But there are so many."
"Have fun at the party."
"I hear people's thoughts."
"The country needs you."
"I'm taking care of her now."
"Did it fix itself?"
"The one I told you about."
"Are you tired of me?"
"Have you heard about this?"
"There is a man outside."
"That's a whole other story."
"You are someone important."
"She is not one of them."
"I know you are innocent."
"You both are."
"No, that's not done."
"Frankie, you're a good boy."
"His sister is making her first communion."
"I would like to ask you a favor."
"No, I won't make it."
"She stayed in her room."
"What should I do?"
"Will we see each other again?"
"I need your enlightenment."
"That's the whole difference."
"It's a family heirloom."
"Come forward, and I will explain everything to you."
"That's when I was a kid."
"We see this all the time."
"Do you think he's involved?"
"Let's talk to Brendan about it tomorrow."
"I came to pick up my father."
"Glad to have worked with you."
"I barely saw her."
"Yes, three years ago."
"It might be the same."
"Many years ago."
"They are using our satellites against us."
"Do you know why you are here?"
"And I am grateful to you for that."
"You look older."
"Nothing is known about her."
"I knew it had to happen."
"You can open your eyes now."
"We'll be there in a few minutes."
"I'll be there as soon as possible."
"I should do it myself."
"I have a very good idea."
"I was the master of Zen."
"I must answer this call."
"But Elaine is taking care of you."
"You've never been here?"
"I'm so happy for you."
"I already asked you."
"I'm going to go through this window."
"Tell me what he's talking about."
"I'll only stay a few minutes."
"It was a good experience."
"You have to look on the bright side."
"Can someone explain this to me?"
"We took care of everything."
"There is a lot of noise."
"He is an arms dealer."
"Tell them what's going on."
"Did you at least talk to him?"
"When did he leave you?"
"What did he do for a living?"
"I want to go to the hospital."
"Stay here, please."
"Are you so sure about everything?"
"Are you so sure about everything?"
"He deceived everyone."
"Everyone will laugh with you."
"I hope to impress him anyway."
"I need a witness."
"Nice to chat with you."
"My feelings for you are real."
"Maybe that's a clue."
"I have had a long journey."
"That's all for now."
"I heard it the first time."
"Don't I seem calm to you?"
"Who should I contact?"
"We'll find you a place."
"When you find yourself a girl?"
"My husband is a good man."
"Let me give you an example."
"I should have been with her."
"Did he tell you something?"
"I guess we'll see each other again."
"Do you know where he might be?"
"I guess it is."
"I'm looking."
"They look like an old married couple."
"She unrolls it backwards."
"I am younger than you."
"It's quite charming."
"If you want to leave, go ahead."
"Yes, I remember that well."
"I'm busy at the moment."
"There is glass everywhere."
"Do you see that man over there?"
"Have you ever talked to him about it?"
"Do you have anything to declare?"
"You are outside your jurisdiction."
"Do you have to do this?"
"He'll do just fine."
"Where are they right now?"
"And the most important article."
"What happened to Omar?"
"It's been closed for years."
"Everyone has friends."
"You are not a person."
"We're going to have to do a lot."
"You know what surprises me?"
"I want you to have this."
"What does this mean?"
"I got a good point."
"As I told you."
"As I told you."
"I would like to speak to my husband."
"You know I would."
"We understand each other, you and I."
"I found a small apartment."
"It's for national security."
"This is our way of doing things."
"I am in a delicate position."
"So, see you later."
"The truth about what?"
"Yes, I will do my best."
"What was in there?"
"How did this happen, you say?"
"We have to start from scratch."
"I was only doing my duty."
"I'll try to call him."
"Looks like I was right."
"It's quite clear."
"It's better for your health."
"You can't hide anymore."
"The shooter is outside."
"You don't want to keep it?"
"Do you have something for us?"
"We have a delivery to make."
"You're going to be fine."
"Let's go, guys."
"No need, I have my own."
"And you let him go?"
"I think we've arrived."
"You'll understand when you grow up."
"You never helped me."
"Are you that good?"
"I want something in return."
"They will be here in a few minutes."
"You're a celebrity in class."
"Was it because of me?"
"He must have had enough."
"She must not see me."
"I'll make a few calls."
"So what did the doctor say?"
"Are you a good man, Inspector?"
"How long did it take?"
"This is what he did."
"Who do you think you are?"
"Tyler's door was closed."
"Is he waiting for you?"
"Thank you for stopping the killers."
"Do you know where the toilets are?"
"If you don't mind."
"Do whatever you want."
"I worked at a country club."
"You look good in this photo."
"How did you get my number?"
"You weren't followed?"
"I have to get to work."
"Where do you want me to start?"
"Don't try to follow us."
"I have to go, guys."
"I'm here, that's all."
"We're here for a while."
"How did you know about the widow?"
"What are you going to do with us?"
"Do you still have a toothache?"
"Oh yes, please."
"I'll pour you a drink."
"I put the speaker on."
"Front center on the altar."
"Tell them what you want."
"What's your name, honey?"
"How could I say that?"
"I brought you a sandwich."
"Did they come back safe and sound?"
"I could take you at your word."
"We've known each other since high school."
"What are you doing here so late?"
"It looks like he's gone."
"News travels fast around here."
"Do you want me to go see?"
"What were you doing in his room?"
"Say goodbye to your friend."
"But I trust you."
"What do you want to do with him?"
"What is your phone number?"
"Yes, it's the first time."
"I was up all night."
"I cut my wrist."
"Do you need more time?"
"What were you looking for?"
"Do you want me to go?"
"She should have told me."
"I have just one question left."
"Do you agree with him?"
"Do you agree with him?"
"I can give you names."
"I've got you covered."
"You only talk about that."
"More than you can imagine."
"I like what you do."
"You haven't changed at all."
"Of course we can."
"I'll stay around."
"It's always the same."
"What do they look like?"
"What time did he leave?"
"They don't say that."
"And you may be right."
"No, we're not together."
"Nobody has anything to say?"
"I have a reputation to uphold."
"You didn't say that."
"What if it's too late?"
"There are about a hundred of them."
"I was thinking."
"I took care of you."
"So, did you have fun?"
"But it has to stay between us."
"V as in Victor, do you receive me?"
"You will end up in history books."
"Or you can come with me."
"I knew you would like it."
"The air will do me good."
"It's bigger than that."
"Do you want to dance?"
"It's only for a few days."
"Thank you for sharing this with me."
"What happened there?"
"I have an appointment with her."
"Get that into your head."
"You dropped something."
"I believe they are."
"Do you know his name?"
"It's one of my dreams."
"You keep saying that."
"You think I want that?"
"Don't you find that curious?"
"If you'll have me."
"Was it because of the dream?"
"He showed us the way."
"Everyone heard it."
"I'd rather it was you."
"How do you know if it's him?"
"Where did you find this dress?"
"It was like a movie."
"I will take you to him."
"I was doing very well."
"I've never done anything to you."
"I did all the work."
"You took my life."
"It might be very easy."
"I'm here for work."
"I almost got caught."
"I'll come with you, if you want."
"Finally some Donald-esque ideas."
"Everything's fine, officer."
"You said I could."
"Where could he possibly come from?"
"Is he that good?"
"It could have ended there."
"Try not to think about it anymore."
"We need his men."
"It is a security system."
"I've seen this face before."
"You know what would be great?"
"Of course he's right."
"I have a business lunch."
"No, that's not going to be possible."
"The whole house was searched."
"I think it's beautiful."
"They can be anywhere."
"I have one of those migraines."
"Morale is at its lowest."
"I wonder where she's going."
"It's a very small town."
"So why did you do that?"
"I was just having fun."
"I have been doing this job for a long time."
"But she didn't come."
"Did you take aspirin?"
"Don't tell the Elf anything."
"I should be by his side."
"What time is it there?"
"How is he doing?"
"If it exists, I will find it."
"About a week ago."
"That sounds reasonable to me."
"What's all this screaming about?"
"We see what they see."
"She didn't go."
"He must be here somewhere."
"Now is the time to act."
"We are a nation of laws."
"We need to do better than that."
"So what is it all about?"
"You are very good like that."
"What are we missing?"
"What do you have in your bag?"
"It's written in your file."
"I know how they feel."
"You're right on time."
"Because it has already started."
"I was sure I would convince you."
"I think I'm done."
"Do you really want me to leave?"
"He went to the bank."
"We are proud of our reputation."
"That's generous of him."
"I had never thought of it."
"It's part of my plan."
"She will speak when she is ready."
"I want to know how you are."
"I think we understand each other."
"I never loved you."
"For what I said."
"I learned that from you."
"Did they give you any records?"
"Have you ever been in combat?"
"Next time will be the right one."
"I have it in front of my eyes."
"You made me a promise."
"I have to call the cops."
"Haven't you read the newspaper?"
"I learned a lot of things."
"Yes, but it's mine."
"You will be safe there."
"I'll see you in an hour."
"What kind of cop are you?"
"Come have a drink with us."
"I vouch for him."
"He needs you now."
"I'll talk to you while I eat."
"Have you ever thought about that?"
"But there are rules."
"This is why we are selling the company."
"I want you to be happy."
"I need you to leave."
"The number is on the fridge."
"And I trust you."
"Everyone here knows that."
"Did you know he was married?"
"I have never loved anyone."
"That's right, I forgot."
"You must have a name."
"Your sister is having her communion tomorrow."
"But he didn't."
"I need the truth."
"They disappeared from circulation."
"You leave in one hour and ten minutes."
"Let's go get something to eat."
"Is this the king approaching?"
"She's been there from the beginning."
"I need an advance."
"The least I can do."
"It's your day off."
"Tell him what's going on."
"You've never been married?"
"The victim's parents arrive."
"Team surveillance, phone tapping."
"Did your dad buy you this?"
"Where did you get all this?"
"No, I'll do it later."
"He appears to be a professional player."
"I'll make you something."
"You don't know anything about us."
"Where have you two been?"
"What kind of man are you?"
"I need to talk to him first."
"Well, what's going on?"
"I know, I was there."
"You did a good deed."
"You will be blacklisted."
"Listen, drive, I'll pay, and that's it."
"Do you think you're a Jedi?"
"I want you so much."
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
"It's cake time."
"Are you sure about the address?"
"Tell him I came by."
"We'll do it next month."
"There is a power plant."
"I can give you my number."
"It's a very long journey."
"My train leaves in an hour."
"I remember every detail."
"When did she say that?"
"I'm from the prosecutor's office."
"I'm doing a little cleaning."
"He is being well taken care of."
"I thought you were friends."
"We are on the right track."
"I hear it in your voice."
"I brought you a book."
"I want to keep this document."
"I'll meet you at your place then."
"Maybe it's her."
"You get what you pay for."
"I think she is."
"Is Security looking for me?"
"Where does she live?"
"How's it going, guys?"
"Do you know where they went?"
"And she, does she have someone?"
"I order you to disperse."
"And which side are you on?"
"Maybe he's our man."
"It was a stroke of luck."
"We need to settle down."
"She had no right."
"Tell him when he arrives."
"A super strong fishing line?"
"You wouldn't have any change?"
"What happened, darling?"
"No, she doesn't."
"Please tell me."
"Only one way to find out."
"Do you have any news for me?"
"I am running for city council."
"This is the last straw."
"I'm coming to see how you're doing."
"I want to be with my family."
"Maybe you were right."
"Will you be there for dinner?"
"Thank you for this vote of confidence."
"But we don't have any."
"There is paperwork."
"I'm worth a million dollars."
"Don't let me down."
"Is everyone having a good time?"
"He is a very handsome man."
"Okay, I'll leave you."
"I'm going to give you a massage."
"Is he cute?"
"Mac, what's going on?"
"You have this power, too."
"I take what I want."
"I promised to do it."
"That's it, that's it."
"You will put the same number."
"You didn't follow her?"
"He's almost family."
"We got you out of there."
"What do you have left?"
"Did this happen, please?"
"I remember his face."
"I looked it up in the dictionary."
"I just wanted to be sure."
"Because I'll tell him."
"I'll write you a check."
"You don't have to ask."
"You don't know the law?"
"Mom, have you seen my sweater?"
"What is the check number?"
"What would I gain from it?"
"Do you want me to call them?"
"You are safe here with me."
"I feel safe with you."
"Do you think this is a game?"
"Do you think this is a game?"
"Of course I remember."
"No, I don't remember."

"Is that what you wanted to hear?"
"What will change?"
"It's a pleasure to see you."
"I'm glad to see you."
"Do you think that makes me happy?"
"This is how it begins."
"I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
"That's what she would have wanted."
"I will do whatever it takes."
"It's a little early for me."
"I knew you could do it."
"You did what you could."
"You love me, don't you?"
"Come on, I'll show you something."
"That's exactly what they want."
"I knew you were going to say that."
"What were you going to say?"
"Sorry it didn't work out."
"That's really kind of you."

"Do you think you scare me?"
"Why do you say that?"
"I'll be with you in a second."
"But what's done is done."
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"I don't have time to play."
"I did what I could."
"What do we know about it?"
"There is a reason for that."
"I'm glad you came."
"It's time for you to go."
"You don't know where he is?"
"Do you know what that is?"
"Tell me what it is."
"You did what you could."
"Do you see what you did?"
"It's me who should thank you."
"I'm glad you're here."
"I'm glad you're here."
"So what do we do?"
"What happened to your arm?"
"What are you asking me?"
"It's good that you're here."
"No, it's just me."
"I'll tell you a little secret."
"Please don't say anything."
"That's all we want."
"Can I see it?"
"Haven't we met before?"
"Do you know what you need?"
"Do you know what you need?"
"I asked myself the same question."
"You know what you have to do."
"You are one of them."
"We will take good care of you."
"I know this is a lot to ask."
"Do what you want with me."
"He was the love of my life."
"Can I use the bathroom?"
"I was going to tell you the same thing."
"I need to talk to you about something."
"Where are you taking him?"
"I have to go home."
"You have to come with me."
"I've never seen you before."
"What's up?"
"Is it a man or a woman?"
"What are you doing, Dad?"
"That's what it seemed to me."
"That's what I want to find out."
"What should I say?"
"What are you doing tomorrow?"
"What are we going to do with him?"
"Tell me what's going on."
"Do you hear what I'm saying?"
"Well, what is it?"
"What is there to know?"
"He doesn't know who he is anymore."
"This is my father's car."
"I know what he did."
"Can I have some water?"
"Is there anything else I can do for you?"
"But what are they doing?"
"Do you have something to tell me?"
"Do you have something to tell me?"
"What do you want from us?"
"I have another surprise for you."
"No, this is not the time."
"It's up to you to do it."
"You better go home."
"What do you want to prove?"
"You don't need to know."
"You don't need to know."
"It was a lifetime ago."
"It's like this every day."
"There must be another way."
"It's time for me to go."
"What do you really want?"
"I thought it was you."
"He said it."
"It's time to go."
"What's taking so long?"
"This is what happened to me."
"Do you want me to go talk to him?"
"What's on the menu?"
"It made me think of you."
"I know he did."
"I'm sure she's fine."
"I'll do anything for you."
"I can only agree."
"She didn't say a word."
"You're not there at all."
"Is that what you're telling me?"
"You don't answer my calls."
"Do you know what you should do?"
"I'm so glad to see you."
"I'm so glad to see you."
"And what was it?"
"Does that make sense?"
"I invented it."
"It's up to me to apologize."
"Okay, what's going on?"
"I'm sure everything will be fine."
"Were there others?"
"Yes, that's exactly it."
"Please don't go."
"Can I see her?"
"It's just goodbye."
"There must be a logical explanation."
"I'm glad you're back."
"I said it was good."
"I'm going to ask her to marry me."
"What's up there?"
"We need to take him to the hospital."
"How do you want me to know?"
"How do you expect me to know?"
"Now, if you'll excuse me."
"What did she get?"
"I don't trust you anymore."
"It's wonderful, isn't it?"
"I found him on the street."
"That's exactly what I was saying."
"I have never seen this man."
"Let me through, please."
"I have a secret to tell you."
"She never told me about it."
"That's easy for you to say."
"I asked her to marry me."
"I can take care of myself."
"That's my father's name."
"What is it, my daughter?"
"I have a very important appointment."
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"I need to talk to you about something."
"I'm surprised to see you here."
"It's the same for me."
"What's stopping us?"
"It's time to go to bed."
"What should you do?"
"Is that all you know?"
"But what do you want?"
"That's what I plan to do."
"Do you know what you're asking me?"
"I have something that belongs to you."
"Got what you need?"
"No, it's not for me."
"What is the point of all this?"
"I've always been there for you."
"Did you tell the police?"
"That's all I see."
"I never want to see you again."
"This is where I want to be."
"This is the last thing to do."
"I'm glad you came."
"I'm glad you came."
"That's what I think too."
"May God's will be done."
"No, she didn't."
"What do I look like I'm doing?"
"That's what people do."
"What did I do?"
"Tell me what you need."
"Tell me what you need."
"I'm going to tell you about my mother."
"That was six months ago."
"Do you know what you're going to say?"
"Who told you to do that?"
"So what are we waiting for?"
"What happened to my son?"
"I've never seen it before."
"And then what happened?"
"What do you know about it?"
"Please come with me."
"What could I say?"
"Someone else did it."
"That's what I believed too."
"He was shot in the back."
"It's the cycle of life."
"All good things must come to an end."
"How can you say such a thing?"
"There is always a first time."
"It was a few years ago."
"What did you drink?"
"Did you do it?"
"What are we going to say?"
"I do what I have to do."
"That's what it means."
"I've seen you somewhere before."
"I've seen you somewhere before."
"Come sit next to me."
"She had a car accident."
"After everything we've been through?"
"Someone must have seen something."
"Do you want me to take care of it?"
"Yes, that's what they say."
"That's all you'll get."
"What did he mean?"
"Where is your sense of adventure?"
"It's a police matter."
"What did I say?"
"It's not just them."
"There is still much to do."
"That's how I work."
"This may be our last chance."
"It's you I've come to see."
"What is it, darling?"
"I would do anything for you."
"That's what people do."
"Crystal clear."
"I hope you can forgive me."
"That's the word I was looking for."
"I've never seen you before."
"I didn't start it."
"It's just a figure of speech."
"I never trusted him."
"That's what they did."
"I've never heard that name."
"I thought you liked him."
"I mistook you for someone else."
"That's what we want to know."
"I thought we had a deal."
"I knew you were going to say that."
"There is no hope."
"It's a job like any other."
"I need to get out of here."
"This is what we are going to see."
"And what happened next?"
"I left it in the car."
"I've told you a thousand times."
"Do you understand what I am telling you?"
"You brought me here for this?"
"What are you here to do?"
"That's what I'm thinking."
"You will have everything you want."
"It's a dream come true."
"It's a dream come true."
"I have a lot of things on my mind."
"It's getting harder and harder."
"What is he doing now?"
"But let me tell you something."
"How could you do this to me?"
"I wanted it to be a surprise."
"I'll take that as a compliment."
"That's the beauty of it."
"You need it more than I do."
"I can't tell him that."
"It's good to see you again."
"I have some questions for him."
"After everything that happened?"
"I made some phone calls."
"It's so good to see you."
"She's the one who did that."
"He said he would be there."
"I need you to do it."
"I think I know what it is."
"Can you give me a hand?"
"What's keeping you here?"
"But what does that mean?"
"I wonder what he wants."
"Sorry for what I said."
"I'm glad I did it."
"That's when it happened."
"How many times do I have to say it?"
"What's in the bag?"
"Any idea who it could be?"
"I haven't stopped calling you."
"You could do whatever you want."
"Did you see that?"
"It's not about him."
"I just don't want to."
"I don't think you understand."
"But I have to go."
"You have your whole life ahead of you."
"You have your whole life ahead of you."
"He was always there for me."
"I need everyone."
"Close the door, please."
"Close the door, please."
"It'll take a minute."
"You came to tell me that?"
"That's all I know."
"This is what we need to find out."
"I wrote it."
"Can I have some privacy?"
"It was good, wasn't it?"
"Must be my lucky day."
"We have to face facts."
"I have some news for you."
"Where do you want to go?"
"It brings tears to my eyes."
"Is that what you want to hear?"
"You have a sense of humor."
"I think she likes you."
"What did she take?"
"You don't need this anymore."
"I have something else to tell you."
"How do you think I feel?"
"What was she doing there?"
"I just want to ask you a few questions."
"But what's going on here?"
"She doesn't answer my calls."
"That's what I learned."
"Who asked you to do this?"
"I think that's the case."
"This is a big day for me."
"How did you know it was me?"
"No, I don't want to go."
"I will do what I have to do."
"It's good that you came."
"You are nothing to me anymore."
"What the hell are they doing here?"
"Thank you all for coming."
"How did you know I was here?"
"How did you know I was here?"
"Do you know what's going to happen?"
"No, that's not it at all."
"And then what happened?"
"I think I can do it."
"I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI."
"What would it have changed?"
"Please don't leave."
"How does this affect me?"
"Do you know something I don't?"
"Until I met you."
"I'm glad to be back."
"Do you know what that means?"
"Do you know what that means?"
"You do what you want with it."
"What did you take?"
"Where did you learn to do that?"
"That's all I own."
"What stopped you?"
"I have something in my eye."
"What did we learn?"
"What's in it for you?"
"I think about you all the time."
"You have something that belongs to me."
"You have something that belongs to me."
"How long have you known this?"
"What happened here?"
"It's a gift from my mother."
"He is a very good person."
"I have never felt so good."
"How long will it take?"
"I hope you slept well."
"Can I talk to you?"
"Call me back when you get this message."
"That was six years ago."
"What's it going to be?"
"You know what I noticed?"
"I am proud of you, my son."
"I told you to let it go."
"I wanted to tell you in person."
"There are many more."
"Thank you for telling me the truth."
"Aren't you at school?"
"Maybe it is."
"There must be another exit."
"Why is this so important to you?"
"But I'll tell you something."
"I made them."
"I have a few questions for you."
"Do you want me to take care of it?"
"Do you want me to take care of it?"
"How could you hide this from me?"
"Sorry it didn't work out."
"I can't find it."
"That's what we did."
"Can you give me a hand?"
"I knew it would end like this."
"So what do you want?"
"Well, what do you want?"
"There is no girl."
"What if he isn't?"
"What if it wasn't?"
"Tell me what I want to know."
"Don't ask me to do that."
"What happened to your head?"
"Do you know what you did?"
"Do you know what you did?"
"I think I'll stay here."
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Hey, what the hell are you doing?"
"The best there is."
"I'll tell you what I know."
"What are you all looking at?"
"I'll be with you in a minute."
"Let's hear what he has to say."
"Where did you learn to do this?"
"Do you want me to do something?"
"Nobody knows we're here."
"That's where it started."
"Yes, what's going on?"
"This is the one I'm talking to."
"I believe that is the case."
"I'll take care of you later."
"You don't need her."
"I think he likes me."
"They said it on the radio."
"What were you thinking?"
"I know where you're going with this."
"I saw you on TV."
"That's good, that's very good."
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"What would you have done?"
"I taught him."
"I know what time it is."
"But what's happening to me?"
"You know what I think about it?"
"No, he didn't tell me anything."
"I'm just telling you."
"I'll call you later."
"I'll tell you something good."
"This might be my last chance."
"There must be someone."
"You know you want to."
"And what do you want?"
"And what do you want?"
"Did I have a choice?"
"But that's what you wanted."
"I should have told you before."
"There is something different."
"Listen, I have to go."
"I'll send it to you right away."
"What is more important?"
"I know what you want to do."
"I said I would."
"I have the situation well in hand."
"It happens to the best of us."
"Your secret is safe with me."
"I want you to be my wife."
"No, I don't want to."
"What did we say?"
"You know it's the truth."
"I have a deal to offer you."
"What happened to your hair?"
"But who isn't there?"
"But what am I talking about?"
"Did he say what he wanted?"
"How long have you been here?"
"You have things to say to each other."
"That's very kind of him."
"I think he likes you."
"She did it."
"It's up to me to say."
"You think I don't know?"
"I feel safe with him."
"This is my favorite moment."
"My God, what's going on?"
"I was thinking of someone else."
"It's my son's birthday."
"I can't do anything more for him."
"I don't need her."
"I didn't think this would happen."
"I wonder who it could be."
"You called me."
"Don't say things like that."
"I always get what I want."
"It was two months ago."
"There are all kinds."
"I really need to talk to him."
"Look what he did to me."
"What are you saying?"
"What did you discover?"
"You know I love you, right?"
"This is where I grew up."
"This is where I grew up."
"Tell me what to do."
"And you didn't."
"And you didn't."
"Where's your sense of humor?"
"Is this really necessary?"
"Are you sure it's there?"
"Are you sure it's there?"
"I called you all night."
"That's what I want to hear."
"I'll see what it is."
"That's what I understood."
"We do the best we can."
"She can do whatever she wants."
"I will remember it all my life."
"How can you be so sure?"
"How can you be so sure?"
"And what are you doing?"
"That's what you said."
"I wonder what's going on."
"Take the time you need."
"I have something to tell him."
"I have already spoken to the police."
"He was the one who found me."
"And what do we do?"
"I stand by what I said."
"That was two weeks ago."
"Am I right or am I right?"
"I did it to protect you."
"What's going on down there?"
"Tell him what he wants to know."
"There may be others."
"I'll call you back later."
"It depends on what you want."
"I know it is."
"Is he allowed to do that?"
"What are we doing here?"
"Did you tell your mother?"
"There's only one second."
"I wrote that."
"His body was never found."
"What could have happened?"
"This is what will happen."
"Can't we go any faster?"
"Am I interrupting something?"
"I thought you liked me."
"Look what he did to you."
"Have you been here long?"
"I'm going to the bathroom."
"Do you want to marry me?"
"You think this is a game?"
"I have an announcement to make to you."
"His body was never found."
"That was the end of the story."
"That's really nice of you."
"Do you want me to call the police?"
"Do you want me to call the police?"
"That's what I wanted to do."
"How did you know I was here?"
"That was seven years ago."
"I have some questions for you."
"I thought we agreed."
"You don't mean what you say."
"Maybe it's for the best."
"We will do everything we can."
"You can't ask me that."
"How long have you worked here?"
"I'll see if she's there."
"I'm in the middle of something."
"I'm telling you."
"I know you can do it."
"I know you can do it."
"I know you can do it."
"I'm so happy to see you."
"Sorry for what happened."
"I said I was fine."
"He did the right thing."
"Because you asked me to."
"There must be a solution."
"What are we going to eat?"
"I know what you said."
"What do you want now?"
"This might be the last time."
"I think I should go."
"I'm so glad to see you."
"It's just water."
"It's up to us to do it."
"You don't know who it is?"
"You don't know who it is?"
"I needed to get some fresh air."
"Have you ever seen anything like this?"
"A healthy mind resides in a healthy body."
"We know what that means."
"Isn't that what you want?"
"Isn't that what you want?"
"Willingly or unwillingly, you will speak."
"I promise you everything will be okay."
"Is this someone I know?"
"That's the impression I get."
"I haven't asked him yet."
"It has everything you need."
"What does she see in him?"
"No, that doesn't make sense."
"It was the year of rebirth."
"I'm glad you're home."
"That's what we do here."
"What happened to your eye?"
"What happened to your eye?"
"I'm sure everything will be fine."
"Is it because of your mother?"
"I want you to meet someone."
"I want you to stay with me."
"I had a shitty day."
"I don't have time now."
"I think she's telling the truth."
"Do you know what we could do?"
"I've been calling you all day."
"Tell him what happened."
"You don't have to answer."
"We need to take him to the hospital."
"Did you find what you were looking for?"
"What are you singing to me?"
"That's what she did."
"How long have you been married?"
"I must be able to trust you with my life."
"I wonder what she's doing."
"For all you have done."
"I can't remember."
"She didn't tell me about it."
"I found it myself."
"I have something to show you."
"Someone has to do it."
"We heard gunshots."
"You may have heard of it."
"I was told to come here."
"Take a look at this."
"This is the reason for my coming."
"There is water everywhere."
"You know what it is, right?"
"I think we're done."
"It's time for breakfast."
"That's very kind of you."
"What did they take?"
"I'm done with all that."
"What can you tell me about him?"
"We did what we could."
"That's what had to be done."
"She got what she deserved."
"This is what we need to find."
"I've told you a hundred times."
"Is that what you're talking about?"
"There is a reason for this."
"There must be something we can do."
"Tell me what it is."
"You know what I was thinking?"
"I just wanted to say goodbye."
"Do you know where we can find it?"
"That's what people say."
"I didn't even think about it."
"I think about him all the time."
"Call if you need me."
"This is exactly what I'm talking about."
"We heard a gunshot."
"This is the reason for my presence."
"He told me a lot about you."
"We have a lot in common."
"We have to face the facts."
"I have to remember that."
"I just want you to know."
"What happened to your leg?"
"What happened to your leg?"
"We have something to tell you."
"I would like you to come with me."
"Your secret is safe with me."
"I'll give you a hand."
"It's about your brother."
"What do you want to talk about?"
"What do you want to talk about?"
"I brought you a little gift."
"No, I'm not talking about that."
"And you agree with that?"
"I know what you need."
"I know you're not sleeping."
"I want to know what you know."
"Nobody knows we're here."
"So what brings you here?"
"You said you would."
"Do you remember our first meeting?"
"Do you see what that means?"
"I still have things to do."
"That's what I should do."
"That's all they had."
"It's not what it used to be."
"I had to do something."
"What happened to the girl?"
"I haven't heard anything."
"That's what the job requires."
"It's so good to see you again."
"Can I talk to you about something?"
"No, it's someone else."
"You know what I mean?"
"Where are you going to go?"
"Nobody knows I'm here."
"I have an important announcement to make."
"This is a big step forward."
"You told me yourself."
"Don't you realize it?"
"Be careful what you wish for."
"I'll have to go."
"It's a pleasure to be here."
"So what are you up to?"
"This is the reason for my visit."
"I want you to know something."
"There must be another reason."
"I just wanted to see how you were doing."
"What does she look like?"
"I think you should go."
"You're going to have to do better than that."
"I had a dream last night."
"This is where we part ways."
"Where is the rest of the team?"
"Is there more than one?"
"That's what I believed."
"We have our whole lives ahead of us."
"It's the law of the strongest."
"I woke up in the hospital."
"Don't try to change the subject."
"Is that what you're telling me?"
"If so, so much the better."
"No, it's not that simple."
"It's nice to see you again."
"Did you have a good weekend?"
"What do you want, man?"
"That's what I was telling you."
"I've seen you somewhere before."
"I've seen you somewhere before."
"I want you to know one thing."
"I can lend you some money."
"I thought you did it."
"How long have you been doing this?"
"What did you write?"
"Do you want us to leave?"
"Please don't move."
"This is the safest place."
"It's the middle of the night."
"I'm all he has."
"If that's what it takes."
"But what do I have?"
"There is a serial number."
"Do you have anything else to tell me?"
"I have an offer to make you."
"He said he would."
"Don't you see what's going on?"
"Do you have everything you need?"
"It's a race against time."
"You know what I'm talking about."
"You know what I'm talking about."
"A magician never reveals his secrets."
"It's my mother's birthday."
"What is the purpose of your visit?"
"That's what I'm going to find out."
"I'll be back in a few hours."
"There is a family resemblance."
"Are you seeing anyone right now?"
"You don't have to be."
"Do exactly as I tell you."
"I didn't tell him about it."
"And what do we have?"
"What are you looking for?"
"Do you know who you're talking to?"
"Are you sure this will work?"
"What the hell are we going to do?"
"I have a question for him."
"Our love will last as long as the stars."
"Do you see what you did?"
"He told me himself."
"You know what I said?"
"Have you told anyone about this?"
"That's so kind of you."
"How could you do this to us?"
"Do you know what she did?"
"Look what I bought you."
"I don't have any either."
"What should I look for?"
"What am I doing?"
"Tell me what you need."
"I want to spend time with you."
"What did you do to your hair?"
"I do what needs to be done."
"I want you to tell me."
"There's someone up there."
"I'll get you some water."
"I only told the truth."
"You tell me what's going on?"
"This is a madhouse."
"I need more than that."
"I ask you one last time."
"I've heard so much about you."
"It wasn't luck."
"I should have done this a long time ago."
"They do everything they can."
"It reminds me of the good old days."
"Tell me what I did."
"Is there anything else I can do for you?"
"You have two million in this safe?"
"Do you swear to tell the whole truth?"
"I'm the one who called you."
"You know what he's capable of."
"So what are you waiting for?"
"Are there any other questions?"
"There is no more time."
"She's pretty, isn't she?"
"It will be better for everyone."
"This is the end of the story."
"I'm sure it's him."
"It's so good to see you."
"Good to see you, man."
"That's what I always do."
"I think I got it."
"I took it."
"Excuse me, I'll be right back."
"Do you think it's that simple?"
"I knew you could do it."
"He was a force of nature."
"What does he know about it?"
"I will give you what you want."
"Do you have something to tell me?"
"You can call me whenever you want."
"It's a place like any other."
"I'm fine where I am."
"I was going to ask you the same thing."
"What caused this?"
"Tell them what you saw."
"I'll be there in half an hour."
"But what are you wearing?"
"This is what we are going to find out."
"I never had a choice."
"I did all this for you."
"It suits you to say that."
"Yes, I did it myself."
"I read it in the newspapers."
"That was very kind of you."
"That's all they know."
"We have a lot of work to do."
"I think you should see this."
"I've never seen you here."
"I have good news for you."
"That was weeks ago."
"I enjoy spending time with you."
"You are the man for the job."
"I want to know who did this."
"You haven't changed your mind?"
"You've never worked in Berlin."
"What happened to your arm?"
"You need to get out of here."
"It's time for me to go home."
"That's what I thought."
"I will give you money."
"I don't remember her."
"Everyone knows who you are."
"You did well to call me."
"You just have to ask him."
"You just have to ask him."
"Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
"I heard the gunshot."
"Come on, I'll show you something."
"When are we going?"
"Do you really think this will work?"
"But what do you have?"
"There must be something here."
"It's the circle of life."
"I want to be there when he wakes up."
"I have some news to tell you."
"No, that's not my style."
"I've been doing it all my life."
"What are you looking at?"
"She couldn't have gone far."
"That's all you'll get."
"I don't know, I swear."
"I have fulfilled my part of the bargain."
"What do you know about it?"
"What do you know about it?"
"What exactly are we looking for?"
"That's what I want too."
"Everyone deserves a second chance."
"I love you more than my life."
"What are we going to do with her?"
"But what do we do?"
"Do you think the same as me?"
"I'll be back in a few days."
"I swear it's true."
"He's just a little boy."
"It's good to be the king."
"You keep saying that."
"After all I've done?"
"That was three months ago."
"I think we found it."
"I didn't tell him."
"That's about it, yes."
"This is my daughter's car."
"Was there anyone else?"
"I thought you weren't coming."
"I thought he was with you."
"I thought he was with you."
"What about my father?"
"No, I think it's good."
"Do you think you can do it?"
"I go there from time to time."
"I'm sure everything is fine."
"It's like talking to a wall."
"What is it, my child?"
"You didn't ask me."
"That's what he needs."
"I know what they are capable of."
"Not after what happened."
"I'll be back for dinner."
"Do what you want with it."
"I saw it in the newspaper."
"I've never heard of that."
"Who could have done such a thing?"
"After what he did to you?"
"I never knew his name."
"You don't go to school?"
"Please stay with me."
"I'm going to be late for work."
"What do I do then?"
"She said she loved me."
"You have to come get me."
"He said what it was?"
"I could do this all day."
"I found this in his pocket."
"Please tell me."
"We'll take good care of you."
"You haven't told him yet?"
"I'm going to put an end to all this."
"I don't really remember."
"Tell me what I can do."
"There are days like that."
"I said I would."
"Thank you for your time."
"That's exactly what I was talking about."
"No, I can't do it."
"Didn't they tell you?"
"How could she do that?"
"How did you know where I was?"
"It's just us here."
"That's what I have to find out."
"I know you want to."
"We need to take you to the hospital."
"Do you want me to call someone?"
"Of course you did."
"You're going to be late for work."
"It's you I've come to see."
"It's all in your head."
"It's time to make a decision."
"You brought me here for this?"
"What can we say?"
"What are you doing here?"
"Show me what you can do."
"You have done me a great service."
"Tell me you have something."
"Could you do something for me?"
"It could mean anything."
"I'll tell you a little secret."
"No, I didn't do that."
"Do you know what we need?"
"I hope it goes well."
"It was a month ago."
"What are you hiding from us?"
"There is a letter for you."
"Less than an hour ago."
"So, what do I look like?"
"And what's going on?"
"I want to be sure."
"You know what I need?"
"He didn't say anything else?"
"She never recovered from it."
"I am the happiest of men."
"You seem fine."
"You will do what I tell you."
"It's time to wake up."
"It's time to wake up."
"I hope you are feeling better."
"Is this what happened to you?"
"No, I didn't mean that."
"It's just between you and me."
"Is that when you say it?"
"Tell me what you think."
"I try not to think about it."
"There is a change of plan."
"Why is this so important to you?"
"Why is this so important to you?"
"I'm tired of this life."
"I never thought about that."
"I thought it was an accident."
"Do you think I'm going to swallow this?"
"I looked into his eyes."
"I said it."
"Want to take a look?"
"I said what I thought."
"I just can't."
"All that remains is to wait."
"I don't want that here."
"Is that what you're telling me?"
"Let the Ring-bearer decide."
"I read something about it."
"I want to see what's going on."
"You have your work cut out for you."
"How long have you been here?"
"How long have you been here?"
"He is like a brother to me."
"Do you know who you're dealing with?"
"You would do the same for me."
"You didn't call the police?"
"There are lives at stake."
"What if you can't do it?"
"What is written here?"
"I have a little gift for you."
"Are you listening to what I'm saying?"
"Of course I thought about it."
"I just want you to be happy."
"Is it just the two of you?"
"All of this is thanks to you."
"I think you don't understand."
"I have so much to say."
"I should have realized that."
"That's what it looks like."
"A quarter of an hour ago."
"There will be no war."
"Where do they come from?"
"What's down there?"
"What's underneath?"
"It's time to go home."
"It's time to go home."
"You don't remember me?"
"You didn't answer my question."
"I took care of it myself."
"No, it's not."
"You only have to say the word."
"How long are you here for?"
"At least, that's what I thought."
"He's trying to tell us something."
"But this is only the beginning."
"That's what we always say."
"I have to go somewhere."
"I need a change of scenery."
"Have you told your parents?"
"Can you do something for me?"
"She is in the bathroom."
"Tell me what I want to know."
"That's what I said."
"I'll see what I can do."
"What did you say?"
"I never saw his face."
"So much has happened."
"I thought you knew."
"You have your father's eyes."
"I'm not either."
"It is the law of the majority."
"I ask you again."
"What is she doing here?"
"Do you know what I saw?"
"I thought you might be interested."
"At least, that's what they say."
"What happened to your nose?"
"Do you know anything about this?"
"We'll deal with him later."
"You said it."
"Thank you for your time."
"I knew it was you."
"I've been waiting for you all my life."
"There must be more to it than that."
"Is this clear to everyone?"
"I thought we were past that."
"What are you telling me?"
"I'm telling you."
"See you on the other side."
"What is there to see?"
"But I know who did it."
"I must say I am impressed."
"I just need a few minutes."
"The best defense is offense."
"What happened to my brother?"
"I am a friend of your mother."
"That's what it's for."
"Everything will be fine, I promise."
"It's a pleasure to see you."
"I'm talking about you."
"You'd better go."
"What is it exactly?"
"Thank you all for coming."
"Can you come, please?"
"Is that really what you think?"
"What did I mean?"
"I told him to do it."
"What if they don't?"
"I thought she was with you."
"There is a police car."
"Do you know what happened to him?"
"Please don't do this."
"I'll see if I can find it."
"For everything you've done."
"I have a doctor's appointment."
"I know you can hear me."
"You told me to do it."
"What did he answer?"
"Remember what I said."
"After everything we've been through."
"You don't have much time left."
"It's photo time."
"I would do anything for her."
"And what do you do for a living?"
"I just got off the phone with him."
"If you want it, come and get it."
"Please trust me."
"You have to make do with what you have."
"You have everything you want."
"See you later."
"I am very happy to see you."
"What do you want from us?"
"It's not me either."
"No, it's not too late."
"No, it's not too late."
"I never had children."
"You say that to please me."
"What the hell are you doing?"
"That's exactly how I feel."
"That's the impression it gives."
"I'm glad you came."
"This is where we need to go."
"That's what we're talking about."
"Are you sure it's him?"
"You must not be late."
"What do you do with it?"
"Did something happen?"
"Do you want to talk to me about something?"
"You don't know where he is?"
"Please say something."
"What happened to you?"
"It's an honor to be here."
"Not after what I did."
"This is a good starting point."
"Is that what you're telling yourself?"
"Is there anyone here?"
"It's good to be home."
"That's why I came here."
"I can see it in his eyes."
"That's how it was when I arrived."
"Are you sure it was him?"
"Are you asking me?"
"I saw it in your eyes."
"I'll see what I can find."
"The whole world knows who you are."
"What's the point of all this?"
"Is it worth it?"
"Haven't you read the newspapers?"
"I wrote it."
"Please say hello to me."
"And what does that mean?"
"It's up to us to decide."
"Where are the car keys?"
"I'm sure that's it."
"What's happening to us?"
"Please don't go."
"He said he loved me."
"I never told you about it."
"We need each other."
"What are you doing to us?"
"I had time to think."
"What were you doing there?"
"You got what you wanted."
"What do they want from me?"
"How long have you lived here?"
"I've never heard of him."
"Can we take a look?"
"They got what they wanted."
"I think it's time."
"Do you think it's a coincidence?"
"I need you to listen to me."
"What don't you understand?"
"I have something you want."
"What if she isn't?"
"What if it isn't?"
"You are one of them."
"Do you remember the last time?"
"Do I look like a cop?"
"Are you sure everything is okay?"
"I dreamed about you last night."
"Thank you for agreeing to meet me."
"This is a case of force majeure."
"This is my mother's recipe."
"I have some money saved."
"What should I think?"
"Keep doing what you're doing."
"What exactly is going on?"
"It's about your father."
"He left you Cul-de-Sac."
"What's going on with you?"
"You've come to the right place."
"What do I mean?"
"When was the last time you saw her?"
"I just got lucky."
"Do you want me to stay with you?"
"I never told him that."
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"Have you ever shot someone?"
"This is what we all want."
"But what does he want?"
"That's nice of you to say."
"I think about him every day."
"There is a password."
"We have everything you need."
"I saw you on TV."
"I'll see you when I see you."
"I was going to tell you the same thing."
"I have a wife and a kid."
"Do you know what tomorrow is?"
"That's what you asked for."
"I did everything."
"There is something to be proud of."
"What is it, my dear?"
"I hope everything goes well."
"I want you to be with me."
"No, I've never met him."
"It's time to get some answers."
"I wasn't born yesterday."
"I don't think that's it."
"I'm late for school."
"I sent her on an errand."
"We really have to go."
"Come on, I want to show you something."
"And what do we say?"
"I was hoping you would tell me."
"I was hoping you would tell me."
"Sometimes you don't have a choice."
"I hope you had fun."
"I wanted to have a little fun."
"I will do whatever it takes."
"Sorry, I have to go."
"It's around the corner."
"You know what I learned?"
"What if she doesn't?"
"When will it end?"
"Go ahead and take a look."
"Leave a message and I'll call you back."
"And I know what it is."
"Do you think I want to?"
"I want to be with you."
"Please follow me."
"Look what they did to you."
"She's just a little girl."
"What are you implying?"
"My Lord, O my Lord, my sir."
"It happens to me from time to time."
"That's how I am."
"What do I need to understand?"
"I'll do it if you do it."
"I'd like to talk about the role."
"So where are we going?"
"You didn't tell anyone?"
"It's his word against mine."
"No, I have no idea."
"We have something to show you."
"That's what I want too."
"It didn't work either."
"There may be a connection."
"All right, I'll tell you."
"Did you understand me?"
"You know what I want to do?"
"There must be thousands of them."
"What are you going to do?"
"I want to hear it from his mouth."
"I have never flown."
"Can you lend me some money?"
"Do you know what he did?"
"I only have a short time."
"You have an aunt in the Valley."
"Show us what you can do."
"Show us what you can do."
"She was the love of my life."
"This is the icing on the cake."
"Let me take a look."
"Do you know what I discovered?"
"Now what do we do?"
"That's what I planned."
"You know what needs to be done."
"You don't have to answer."
"How can you be so sure?"
"I will not answer this question."
"I don't remember very well."
"What are you doing?"
"Whatever happens, stay with me."
"That was eight years ago."
"Look what he did to me."
"I'll see you later."
"Please tell me."
"I should have been there for you."
"Did you see who did that?"
"It's never the right time."
"You are all I have."
"That's what he's going to do."
"I've heard that all my life."
"Do we agree?"
"What proves it to me?"
"I have something for you too."
"What the hell are we doing now?"
"How is this possible?"
"Is this supposed to cheer me up?"
"Don't do that to me."
"No, I'm the one who's sorry."
"This is my mother's house."
"You're all I have left."
"How did it go last night?"
"He seemed fine."
"What's in it for us?"
"How long has he been there?"
"Does that make sense?"
"I've heard so much about you."
"I have a lot to learn from you."
"I know what you saw."
"How long have you known him?"
"I appreciate it more and more."
"How long are you here for?"
"I said I was going."
"I see you, brother, and thank you."
"I told my mother."
"I heard his voice in my head."
"There is something there."
"I need to go to the bathroom."
"I've been looking for you all day."
"I only thought about that."
"I saw her on TV."
"I thought you might want to know."
"Can I use the bathroom?"
"He will remember it before the end."
"I brought him."
"I'm the only one who was right."
"I don't have any other."
"Hey, what is it?"
"Take a look at this."
"I told you to sit down."
"I told you to sit down."
"We'll deal with that later."
"I think you'll like it."
"I think I'll do it."
"Did you write this?"
"You will be my eyes and ears."
"You have it in front of you."
"Can't we talk about something else?"
"I'll get you some ice."
"What does all this mean?"
"Is that all you know?"
"I think it's time."
"I think I would remember it."
"I am the man for the job."
"I'm going to put them in a vase."
"Is that clear?"
"I did it, that's all."
"What's going on, guys?"
"You haven't aged a day."
"But what is he talking about?"
"He was here just now."
"I am one of them."
"He says it's very important."
"How nice of you to come."
"You better get used to it."
"I want it to be a surprise."
"I hope you have a plan."
"This is where I was born."
"Look what they did to me."
"I called earlier."
"What do I need to know?"
"Is everything okay here?"
"Come this way, please."
"You seem to like it."
"Isn't it the same as here?"
"Go tell him how you feel."
"This is exactly what I was looking for."
"Where did he go?"
"What does that tell you?"
"I never had children."
"This is one of my favorites."
"Have you seen her?"
"Is that all you want?"
"There is an ongoing investigation."
"No, I already told you."
"I came as quickly as possible."
"What's going on, Mom?"
"I would do whatever you want."
"But what am I saying?"
"I'll tell you in the car."
"I want to talk to you about something."
"You did a very good job."
"Don't take this lightly."
"Is this what you saw?"
"Two or three days ago."
"What did I do to deserve you?"
"What do I offer you?"
"What do I owe you?"
"What do I owe you?"
"What happens next?"
"Please open the door."
"Come on, I'll show you something."
"So, here's what we're going to do."
"Not if you don't want to."
"This is the chance of a lifetime."
"I told you not to come."
"On the other side of town."
"Are you sure it's her?"
"If you say so, I believe you."
"That's why I called you."
"Will this tragedy have repercussions?"
"I'm glad you're back."
"He must be around here somewhere."
"That's what I was planning to do."
"That's what we said."
"Did you want to talk to me about something?"
"Did you tell your father?"
"I have a lot of work to do."
"We have things to say to each other."
"Of course I will."
"Where do you think you're going?"
"They don't need you anymore."
"What did you find in him?"
"See what you can get out of it."
"I have to tell you."
"I know what you must be thinking."
"It's the end of an era."
"No, it wasn't like that."
"I wonder what he's doing."
"I'll get involved if I want."
"Do you know what I'm going to order?"
"What did you do?"
"There must be an explanation."
"What could I say?"
"And I have the right to speak."
"I know what he means."
"Is there anyone at home?"
"What could I have seen her in?"
"If you can call it that."
"I hope you are having fun."
"I wanted to tell you in person."
"I didn't ask you."
"Don't tell me he's good."
"We had a great time together."
"If you want to go, go."
"He is the father of my children."
"You're all he has."
"What did we say?"
"I want to hear it from you."
"It's happening."
"We have a lot of things to do."
"How do you know that?"
"I was there when it happened."
"You taught me."
"I know what you need."
"Where is he hiding?"
"It's your word against mine."
"I will be back as soon as possible."
"There's one for you."
"Is anyone listening to me?"
"Who elected you gang leader?"
"But I have to tell you something."
"So what are you waiting for?"
"You just have to say it."
"I don't think I can."
"I don't think I can do it."
"What do you offer me?"
"You did what you had to."
"And you, the trigger ace?"
"Shall we share breakfast first?"
"Thank you, that's very kind of you."
"I'll say that you called."
"Think about what I said."
"Do you know what we have to do?"
"What do you want then?"
"I wanted to apologize for last night."
"That's where I want to go."
"It only happened once."
"Do you know what you need?"
"That's very thoughtful of you."
"I just wanted you to know."
"But that's ancient history."
"You think I did that?"
"I think he likes you."
"Do you want me to tell you why?"
"But what's happening to you?"
"How could you do this to him?"
"What happened to the American dream?"
"We both did it."
"He was very kind to me."
"What am I going to wear?"
"She didn't come home last night."
"The light slid north."
"That's so kind of you."
"I hoped it wouldn't come to that."
"What did you do to my son?"
"I didn't expect this ending."
"You did well to call me."
"Let's see what he has to say."
"No, I'm not like that."
"This is exactly what I feared."
"I have a cat in my throat."
"At least, what's left of it."
"When can I get my own horse?"
"You did all this for me?"
"What do we need?"
"I've never seen you there."
"That's all he has."
"Is it yours or mine?"
"I have something to ask you."
"I put out a search notice."
"I knew I'd find you there."
"Embrace the destiny that is yours."
"That's very noble of you."
"What do you have to say to that?"
"There is no road."
"That's what I thought too."
"What is it, sir?"
"Don't say another word."
"Let me ask you a question."
"I'll take that as a no."
"She doesn't know anything."
"Haven't you heard about it?"
"I don't feel so good."
"I know what you're capable of."
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"I waited for you all night."
"With you, in one of your adventures."
"But it's up to you to decide."
"What did he ever do to her?"
"I don't want her here."
"What do you think about it?"
"Do you realize what that means?"
"So do what I tell you."
"What are you doing, honey?"
"Say something, please."
"That's what I read."
"That's what we do."
"How much time do you need?"
"I was in Avatar training with him."
"I'll call you when I'm done."
"How dare you talk to me like that?"
"I thought you liked him."
"We have a lot of things to do."
"There may be something else."
"That's what we meant."
"It was nice to meet you."
"This is what you need."
"Someone has to do it."
"I feel like we're going to have fun."
"I thought you might be hungry."
"I thought you might be hungry."
"Repeat what you just said."
"Anyone have anything to say?"
"I don't know, I'll see."
"Mom, what is it?"
"We'll make it work."
"Take your things and go."
"She seemed fine."
"I mistook you for someone else."
"How do you know it's him?"
"Do you think this task is yours?"
"It's in the middle of nowhere."
"So what do you say?"
"Honey, what's going on?"
"It was a pleasure to see you again."
"You know what's going on."
"She didn't make it."
"The lights of the Holiday Tree."
"And that's about it."
"You need to see a doctor."
"I'll give it back to you in an hour."
"So what is love?"
"There's just you and me."
"I will do whatever you say."
"There is a price to pay."
"That's exactly what it is."
"Do you know who it is?"
"Everyone is making fun of me."
"Don't you want to come with me?"
"Wait, I have something for you."
"We have a lot of work to do."
"I have another gift for you."
"Call me if you have any news."
"Someone needs to talk to him."
"Come give me a hand."
"Do you think that's why?"
"I have to get out of here."
"The Master must enter the tunnel."
"I came to say goodbye to you."
"You can say whatever you want."
"That's where it comes from."
"I thought you knew."
"I've been back for weeks."
"Thank you for what you did."
"I'm fed up."
"I got the hang of it."
"You know I like you."
"That's how we play."
"That's what you want, right?"
"This is what we must do."
"What did you get?"
"What do you bring me?"
"You'll need it more than I will."
"Can't you tell me?"
"I would like to talk to you about something."
"I would like to talk to you about something."
"I think I have something."
"You're going to have to do better than that."
"Yes, I already told you."
"There's something for everyone."
"I manage very well on my own."
"A lot has happened."
"Can I hug you?"
"It's not just her."
"Where do you think she is?"
"That's all it was."
"How does this affect you?"
"It was a pleasure to meet you."
"I know exactly what I want."
"There must be another way."
"I know what I need to know."
"Is there any other way out?"
"You had a car accident."
"No, what is it?"
"It's just another day."
"What will happen to them?"
"They have to decide how to end it."
"No, you're not going to do that."
"He who sows the wind reaps the whirlwind."
"Is it someone's birthday?"
"Millions of lives are at stake."
"The dwelling place of his spirit is crumbling."
"It's an hour from here."
"Do you realize what you've done?"
"I think about her all the time."
"I think about her all the time."
"I always wanted one."
"And now, something completely different."
"This is the reason for my call."
"Take back what you just said."
"No, there aren't any more."
"I have two words to say to him."
"Did you write it?"
"Yes, that's what I do."
"I know it's been hard."
"I need a small favor."
"What are you giving me?"
"Is that what you meant?"
"But there is hope."
"What did he say?"
"You have to do something for me."
"What if we don't?"
"I think we should get married."
"Wouldn't you be my family?"
"Let's see what's inside."
"That's what my father used to say."
"I have a better job for you."
"What should I see?"
"I know you saw it."
"Do with me what you want."
"Do with me what you want."
"Do what you want with me."
"It's up to you to find out."
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
"That's what pays for all this."
"It's always like this."
"Do you know where I can find it?"
"Not while we have strength."
"I know what we have to do."
"It's your word against his."
"What do you like to do?"
"I have a few questions for him."
"Did you find something interesting?"
"I think this is the end."
"I want to know more about you."
"Do you know where I can find it?"
"What do you want me to tell him?"
"That's what men do."
"I saw it with my own eyes."
"I try to do my best."
"I'll tell my father."
"You only have it by chance."
"But that is not the point."
"You should know that."
"Do you think he did it?"
"Maybe I did."
"I could tell you the same thing."
"What are you playing?"
"I think this is the right one."
"Do you think it's a coincidence?"
"What did you put?"
"Because the mirror shows many things."
"What are you doing here?"
"I thought you didn't drink."
"Tell him I want to talk to him."
"What if he's not there?"
"I can never give it back to you."
"Haven't you read the newspapers?"
"No one deserves it more than you."
"I didn't order pizza."
"I am a friend of your father."
"What did you learn?"
"Doctor, what is it?"
"Can I do anything?"
"You do what you have to do."
"Can I ask you another question?"
"I'm really glad to see you."
"How did I not think of that?"
"You think I'm going to believe that?"
"No, I'm not going to do that."
"Listen to what I have to say."
"There might be something."
"He said you would say that."
"I read the police report."
"Is that supposed to tell me something?"
"It was my word against his."
"It's like I'm there."
"I really had a good time."
"I'll give you some good advice."
"Do you know what they did?"
"That's my mother's name."
"There is a call for you."
"Do you have what you need?"
"It's time to get up."
"It's time to get up."
"Do you think he saw us?"
"I know I did it."
"My phone keeps ringing."
"We've come a long way together."
"What was he doing here?"
"Please come with me."
"I read an article about it."
"I have one more thing to do."
"That's what I tell him."
"I ask you to trust me."
"I ask you to trust me."
"I wanted to take the Ring from him."
"It's just a piece of paper."
"Tell me you have something."
"What does it bring you?"
"You know I love you too?"
"Is there anyone at home?"
"Please leave a message."
"I see what I can do."
"Are you sure everything is okay?"
"I know who is behind all this."
"Please don't say anything."
"How did you know I was here?"
"Line up like everyone else."
"No, I have things to do."
"Take the time you need."
"Where are the horse and rider?"
"I only trust you."
"You did very well."
"There is work to be done."
"I thought it was you."
"She's gorgeous, isn't she?"
"I came to say goodbye to you."
"There is good in him."
"But I was lucky."
"I only have you in the world."
"Do you know what that does to me?"
"I think he did."
"And that's what I want."
"She's not quite sane anymore."
"They are all I have."
"This is how we survive."
"It was a gift from my father."
"But what the hell are they doing?"
"No one knows you're here."
"What if he doesn't make it?"
"And what does it do?"
"Is this what you really want?"
"How long have we known each other?"
"How long have we known each other?"
"I thought the same thing."
"Do you know what happened?"
"Show me what you can do."
"That's what you have to do."
"No one else knows."
"Is that really what you think?"
"Are you sure this is it?"
"I didn't ask any questions."
"I'll take a look at it."
"But I'll tell you something."
"It's all smoke and mirrors."
"He is the chief of police."
"I thought it was you."
"It's nice to see you again."
"What do we have left?"
"When will we see each other again?"
"You won't need this anymore."
"I could ask you the same thing."
"Where is the rest of your team?"
"You know what I meant."
"It will be, my dear friend."
"What if it isn't?"
"I know what I need."
"He said it was personal."
"What were you doing here?"
"What were you doing here?"
"But what do you think?"
"I want to make love with you."
"I must be dreaming."
"He is a friend of my father."
"I can give you money."
"I read it in a magazine."
"Isn't that already the case?"
"I thought that was the case."
"You have been assigned this task."
"How long have you known this?"
"You know that, don't you?"
"I'll see you later."
"I knew you wouldn't understand."
"I'm sure it was you."
"How do you know about this?"
"I want to make a phone call."
"It's a pleasure to have you."
"You're the one who doesn't understand."
"I know exactly what it is."
"Do you know what you can do?"
"Take care of each other."
"I never thought about that."
"Where do I put this?"
"That's what I needed."
"No, I'm the one who thanks you."
"You've never looked so beautiful."
"Not good taste at all, my darling."
"But something happened."
"Do you know what I need?"
"What are you thinking about?"
"I need to go home."
"This is what the prophecy says."
"I told him."
"I think I have the solution."
"What is it, my heart?"
"Where do they come from?"
"What was I going to do?"
"What exactly do you do?"
"I think this is for you."
"I never told him."
"Okay, what's going on?"
"No need to tell me."
"Are you sure it's okay?"
"I think I found it."
"Do you want me to read it to you?"
"But I'm glad to see you."
"You don't remember him?"
"There's another one here."
"I told him the same thing."
"Is there anything to eat?"
"Because she told me so."
"What happened to your father?"
"Is that what you say?"
"Tell me what you need."
"Do you think I have a choice?"
"What happened to his face?"
"He told me to do it."
"It's happening."
"I have to take you home."
"No, I'm the one who thanks you."
"I hope you change your mind."
"Looks like you're having fun."
"Don't leave me in the dark."
"No, you're not going to do it."
"How far are you willing to go?"
"So what has changed?"
"I told you I'd come."
"I was the first on the scene."
"Yes, you already told me."
"Do you know what he's going to do?"
"Can we know what's going on?"
"We can do this all day."
"I have already given the order."
"Do you want to do something for me?"
"I'm leaving right away."
"You owe someone an apology."
"People do it all the time."
"What could have happened to him?"
"I think you should do it."
"Are you feeling well?"
"Tell him we have to go."
"No, you didn't do that."
"What the hell are you doing?"
"What did you want to do?"
"It wasn't love."
"Is there anything we can do for you?"
"How long will this last?"
"There's no accounting for taste."
"She would do anything for you."
"I knew it wouldn't work."
"What if I need to go to the bathroom?"
"You're only young once."
"This is the most important thing."
"I feel like I know her."
"They are operating on him."
"Tell us everything you know."
"I just want her to be happy."
"Do you see something you like?"
"Do you know anything about this?"
"Not after what you did."
"It was a one-night stand."
"Nobody knows what's going on."
"I really had a good evening."
"That's all you'll get."
"I want another cup of coffee."
"But you did it anyway."
"I'm just saying it's possible."
"If it is not?"
"You are the man of the house."
"This has to stay between us."
"They are not on the list."
"Is this the role of the cigarette?"
"I owe you an apology, my King."
"Is that all you care about?"
"Both of you come to my office."
"That's not the point."
"You should talk to someone about this."
"You will do as you are told."
"Thank you for agreeing to speak with me."
"I'm glad you came."
"I'm glad you came."
"You are far from home."
"When can we see each other?"
"How could you let this happen?"
"You have to get out of here."
"I need an ID."
"What did I get?"
"I never want to see you again."
"I did as you said."
"Don't you dare do that."
"No, I didn't tell him."
"Can I know what you are doing?"
"Can I know what you are doing?"
"What happened to my mother?"
"What is there to explain?"
"Is that what you were thinking?"
"What is this?"
"I've done it many times."
"Are you sure this will work?"
"Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"I took it."
"I need time for myself."
"That's all we had."
"You haven't changed at all."
"This is how it all began."
"Tell him I want to see him."
"No, you're more beautiful than ever."
"Let's see what she has to say."
"Is there anyone with you?"
"I'll see what he wants."
"That's what my mother used to say."
"You are blessed among all women."
"You look hungry."
"You look hungry."
"I'm here if you need me."
"I told you on the phone."
"I suspected you'd be here."
"I'll bring you a glass of water."
"Will we have an early spring?"
"She's not a little girl anymore."
"You don't have to answer."
"Can we have some privacy?"
"No, it's not."
"Do you know what's going to happen?"
"What were you going to say?"
"Thousands of lives are at stake."
"I want to be with you forever."
"I know very well who you are."
"It suits you better than it does me."
"Actually, there is something."
"Give me the car keys."
"You understand that, don't you?"
"That's what I meant."
"I'll be back in two hours."
"What did I do to deserve this?"
"I'll only ask once."
"There must be a good reason."
"I'm going to the bathroom."
"You have your work cut out for you."
"Does it get easier?"
"You are more and more beautiful."
"Can I see your ID card?"
"I am a great admirer of yours."
"Don't take this lightly."
"What if you can't do it?"
"Is it good for everyone?"
"I took a day off."
"Do you think I'll believe you?"
"I have important things to do."
"He heard his Master calling him."
"People want value for their money."
"What did he write?"
"You better get on with it."
"What are they doing here?"
"Did you have a good weekend?"
"Room for everyone."
"Try reading my mind again."
"How do you know that?"
"What are you going to say?"
"This is where you belong."
"At dawn, look east."
"She's right next to me."
"I need to take a shower."
"She's someone's daughter."
"He knew it was time."
"S.A.R.A.H., the door."
"I took a look."
"I'm sorry, but it's true."
"I know what can be done."
"It's happening."
"That's what you do, right?"
"What are we talking about?"
"It's time to say goodbye."
"What did he want from you?"
"I can't say it."
"I finish what I started."
"It's good to see you."
"As if you didn't know."
"No, he didn't say that."
"That's what we said."
"Can we take a look?"
"No, I didn't tell him anything."
"I know, you told me."
"Do you know what that means?"
"But I want something in return."
"He is in the bathroom."
"I have to go anyway."
"Do you want me to make you laugh?"
"No, I don't want to do that."
"Do you want me to go get her?"
"Because I'm in love with you."
"I just wanted to talk to you about that."
"It is the most important meal."
"This is what you are going to do."
"Where is the rest of the crew?"
"Yeah, what is it?"
"Of course I saw it."
"I'll do what it takes."
"I may have had a Leroy."
"One month is enough to get to know them well."
"Yes, that's what I see."
"No, you didn't."
"There's nothing up there."
"I'm not sure yet."
"I was glad to see you."
"Do you have something to tell us?"
"Can't it wait until tomorrow morning?"
"Isn't that always the case?"
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"There is no war."
"Have you told anyone about this?"
"That's so kind of you."
"Nod your head if you can hear me."
"What are you telling me?"
"That's all he cares about."
"I've never seen this before."
"I'll tell him you came by."
"I know what he's capable of."
"Yes, I think you're right."
"It was nice to meet you."
"You know I'm going to do it."
"Can you hear yourself talking?"
"You have your mother's eyes."
"Do you want to hug him?"
"That's what we all want."
"I can't do that here."
"Tell me what you remember."
"I just needed to see you."
"That's what we should do."
"I said I loved you."
"I don't go to school."
"I thought it was him."
"I'll tell my mother."
"I was sure you spoke English."
"I know what's up."
"I didn't get a response."
"I have a little business to attend to."
"That was years ago."
"You did a very good job."
"What is this?"
"Is it because of your father?"
"I never had a father."
"Do you have any money on you?"
"Is it still good for tonight?"
"I've never seen her before."
"That's what I was wondering."
"No, I'm the one who's sorry."
"Of course there are."
"Everything you say is true."
"I want you to leave here."
"How can you be so sure?"
"How can you be so sure?"
"That's what I would do."
"You can't do that to him."
"Can I talk to him?"
"You're going to screw everything up."
"Is that what you want?"
"I never did anything to you."
"That's what I was thinking."
"I read this in a magazine."
"How did you know I was here?"
"This is the one I want."
"Do you want me to go?"
"I read that in the newspaper."
"Is that what I'm thinking?"
"Are you talking to me?"
"Can we postpone this?"
"We all have a role to play."
"I have eyes in the back of my head."
"I have to take him to the hospital."
"I take the first turn on guard."
"You love me, don't you?"
"He didn't tell you?"
"I read it in his eyes."
"I don't think you understand."
"How did you know it was me?"
"I never knew my parents."
"This is what pays for your research."
"It's like he disappeared."
"Do you have family there?"
"I was just passing by, that's all."
"We look out for each other."
"What will it give?"
"We have something to tell you."
"This time it's for real."
"I'm so happy to see you."
"What's so special about it?"
"The police have it."
"There was more to it than that."
"That's all they have."
"There is a change of program."
"Yes, you could say that."
"She is a friend of the family."
"And behind that door, your own office."
"What's in it for you?"
"Those are his words, not mine."
"It's a sleight of hand."
"It's the same as mine."
"What happened this morning?"
"Do you know what I did?"
"I need more information."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"You will be the Fellowship of the Ring."
"Would you excuse me for a moment?"
"I told you it would happen."
"Do you want me to tell you?"
"Hey, what's going on?"
"I need a small favor."
"Someone I trust."
"If that's what you think."
"It was there when I arrived."
"Is that all you wanted?"
"It's okay, the way is clear."
"There could be others."
"He's been wanting to hang me for a while."
"You are the father of my child."
"What does all this mean?"
"Friends, that's what it's for."
"How long were you married?"
"Can I know what's going on?"
"This is of the utmost importance."
"I have a lot of respect for you."
"Who else is there?"
"What can you tell us about him?"
"Are you sure you're ready?"
"I thought that was in the past."
"This is the third time this week."
"For once, we agree."
"You must do what I say."
"I thought you were my friend."
"It's because he loves you."
"I was in the bathroom."
"I thought we had a deal."
"They seem to be having fun."
"Here, at the end of all things."
"I can get you out of here."
"We are all children of God."
"I know you have questions."
"Who put you on the case?"
"You'll know it when you see it."
"We need to take you to the hospital."
"How long have you been together?"
"Want to take a look?"
"Have you ever been with a woman?"
"So what was it?"
"I think we should do it."
"The world will have to deal with us."
"I want to know what you are doing."
"This is where it all began."
"That's what it's all about."
"He attacked me."
"At least we have that in common."
"You're the one I wanted to see."
"They are on a war footing."
"It's a pleasure to meet you."
"A year and a half ago."
"I want to go all the way."
"The door was locked from the inside."
"Is there another way?"
"Do you remember our first meeting?"
"What happened to these people?"
"Are you sure it's her?"
"I want you to do something."
"It's good to see you again too."
"I can, and I will."
"How long will it take?"
"I've been calling you all morning."
"We're going to take a tour of the neighborhood."
"How kind of him."
"I have a word to say to you."
"I suspected it was you."
"You don't want me to stay?"
"Do you think he's still here?"
"Did you make them?"
"It's my wedding day."
"One more step and I shoot."
"I need a drink."
"Can I call you back?"
"Call me if you have any news."
"One for all and all for one."
"I knew I was forgetting something."
"You don't want to tell me?"
"This is the shortest way."
"But what is she doing?"
"You look fine."
"Everyone was very kind."
"There is no boy."
"I just wanted to know how you were doing."
"I'm the one who should be thanking you."
"Dude, what the hell are you doing?"
"That's nice of you to say."
"It will take as long as it takes."
"I want to be sure."
"You do what you're told."
"Want to know what you're playing for?"
"I want to know what happened."
"There is a letter for you."
"What else did you hide from me?"
"I need you to focus."
"Are you sure it's him?"
"Are you sure it's him?"
"I saw it in action."
"Did someone say something to you?"
"Is this what you wanted?"
"Where did he come from?"
"I think it's over there."
"I said I'd think about it."
"ID card, please."
"But let me tell you something."
"I remember you like this."
"I tried to dissuade him."
"You thought I wouldn't know?"
"Not so long ago."
"How are we going to get out of here?"
"What do you want to see?"
"I'll tell him you came by."
"What did you hear?"
"It's in everyone's interest."
"You have something between your teeth."
"I sent it."
"You look like you're having fun."
"He can say whatever he wants."
"I have a wife and two children."
"Do you know what happened to him?"
"Show me what you can do."
"You are like a son to me."
"I think I did it."
"Because I don't love you."
"I think we should talk about it."
"I need to take some samples."
"Calm down, everything will be okay."
"I have the right to be here."
"I have a little something for you."
"That's what I said."
"I always say what I think."
"How will they know we're here?"
"I have a wife and a daughter."
"Tell them what happened."
"It was up to me to do it."
"The whole planet is one huge city."
"I knew you'd change your mind."
"I'll tell them where I am tomorrow."
"I improvise as I go along."
"Listen to what I have to say."
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
"You know what would make me happy?"
"What was inside?"
"I'm really glad to see you."
"I'll leave you both."
"As if he never existed."
"That's one way to look at it."
"Sir, what's going on?"
"No one ever told me that."
"I don't know anything about that."
"I chose it."
"Where are you hiding?"
"It's important for everyone."
"Of course I trust you."
"Who are you talking to?"
"Do you know where we can find it?"
"That's what I'm asking you."
"Is there room for me?"
"But you didn't answer me."
"What do you want me to do?"
"This is a great day for us."
"He's the one we need."
"Everyone knows it, except you."
"I'm going to get some water."
"Which he didn't do."
"What makes us human?"
"Sorry for what I said."
"What happened to my family?"
"I'm surprised to see you here."
"I'm surprised to see you here."
"What just happened?"
"I dream of taking samples there."
"No, it's fine, it's fine."
"Have you heard about my work?"
"You could have played a big role."
"See, I told you so."
"She is the love of my life."
"I'll know when I see it."
"I'm going to get something to eat."
"I am very happy to be here."
"You may want to change your statement."
"I have a deal to offer you."
"Call me if you change your mind."
"What did you do to my brother?"
"Call me if you have any questions."
"I got your support."
"There's going to be action."
"It's up to you to wake up."
"I never told anyone."
"Can we talk about it?"
"And they will do the same thing here."
"The final step in becoming a man."
"There is something written."
"Are you trying to tell me something?"
"How do you intend to protect me with this?"
"Is this the life you want?"
"I want everything to go well."
"What the hell are they doing here?"
"I believe this is yours."
"What happened to him?"
"It's your word against mine."
"It's the price of fame."
"Am I my brother's keeper?"
"How was your first day?"
"You know I don't drink."
"Did you make it?"
"You just have to go there."
"What would I say to him?"
"Have you ever seen anything like this?"
"But it didn't happen."
"Would you mind doing me a favor?"
"That's what I want to see."
"Tell us what you saw."
"Tell us what you saw."
"No, I don't want to talk about it."
"Do you think you're one of them?"
"Okay, what do we have?"
"No photos, please."
"Let's find a way out of here."
"What does he tell you?"
"It's nice of you to come see me."
"I'm in the bathroom."
"I'll do what I want with it."
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"What else could I have done?"
"What do we tell him?"
"Did you see a man running?"
"I always dreamed of going there."
"And to whom do I have the honor?"
"He will be the inheritance of my kingdom."
"I have to get out of here."
"I have to get out of here."
"You're the one who's going to listen to me."
"How will I know if he chooses me?"
"I'll take a closer look."
"I thought it was a dream."
"And what about you?"
"I love you and always will."
"I want to spend my life with you."
"I want to see it closer."
"What do we do next?"
"What do we do next?"
"That's very kind of you, sir."
"Is there anything for me?"
"I ask you again."
"I'm sure everything is fine."
"Be careful what you do."
"He was the one who found me."
"Engine control looks good."
"All Na'vi know this story."
"Who else could have done this?"
"Can I have a hand?"
"Your mother must be proud of you."
"You didn't sleep with her?"
"Is this understood?"
"I will do it if necessary."
"You know I'm telling the truth."
"You know what I thought?"
"I hope I'm not late."
"Have you been here long?"
"No, I've never seen her."
"I only trust you."
"On the other side of the hill."
"I know some things you don't."
"It's the most beautiful gift."
"Is that what you wanted to hear?"
"Is that what you wanted to hear?"
"This is what you need to do."
"I can't do anything more for you."
"I'm sure it's true."
"Do as I told you."
"You did very well."
"You did very well."
"I heard the gunshots."
"I have family there."
"I have something to take care of."
"You just have to say yes."
"The Ring is still in your pocket."
"That's all he wants."
"Almost the entire world population."
"Have you seen anyone else?"
"That's not it either."
"I still have some shopping to do."
"The opportunity to have your sentence reduced."
"I think I love you too."
"Nobody knows what it is."
"But what do they want?"
"I think I remember that."
"What were you doing there?"
"What do I have to do with it?"
"I'll see where they are."
"Did you just realize that?"
"There is one thing you need to know."
"I am very glad to see you."
"Before I change my mind."
"I remember our first meeting."
"What happened to the other one?"
"I think he chose you."
"To do what we are told."
"More than you can imagine."
"Are you talking about me?"
"You didn't ask me."
"They say you are the best."
"I want to get out of here."
"And how do you plan to do this?"
"For everything I've done."
"What are the chances of this happening?"
"I've always dreamed of saying that."
"I must come in with you."
"You did well to call us."
"Do you remember your marriage proposal?"
"We'll take a look."
"There was a short circuit."
"I have something in my eye."
"I want the same thing as you."
"I make do with what I have."
"Do you want me to come pick you up?"
"I told the police."
"Watch and learn from it."
"It was three days ago."
"Have you seen anyone else?"
"Reaction time comes into play."
"Of course I have one."
"I apologize for the other day."
"Do you know what you need?"
"It is their most sacred sanctuary."
"I want to know what you think."
"Thank you for taking care of me."
"Tell us what to do."
"Do you know the make of his car?"
"But what are you doing?"
"I'm about to leave."
"He is very proud of his work."
"I think it's mine."
"Can I hug you?"
"I know what happened to him."
"They kindly asked him for his papers."
"What have you done with my daughter?"
"Where does this leave us?"
"What's in this bag?"
"I wanted to apologize for this morning."
"Can I use your bathroom?"
"Do you want a quarter of an hour?"
"I would have done exactly the same thing."
"It's closing time."
"There's something over there."
"Have you told anyone?"
"You are like a brother to me."
"Tell him to go to hell."
"It was easier than I thought."
"No, I didn't say it."
"The kid has it."
"What's in it for you?"
"I'm talking to you."
"The best at what he does."
"Is anyone on board?"
"Listen, here's what we're going to do."
"It's party time."
"You give me goosebumps."
"I can handle this on my own."
"I know you want to."
"You told us you love music."
"What do you think you're going to do?"
"You're saying that to make me leave."
"I have another mission for you."
"I'll take that as a yes."
"No, I haven't seen them."
"There is one thing you need to know."
"That's what I was talking about."
"Do you have anything to tell me?"
"Sorry for earlier."
"What did you do with your time?"
"See you at dinner, kids."
"He just told them his name."
"This is the only one I have."
"There are many more."
"Is this what you want to do?"
"Let me get my toothbrush."
"I don't think about anything else."
"I'm glad you came."
"I didn't expect to find you here."
"Everyone knows who you are."
"She knew I was talking to the colonel."
"It's up to the judge to decide."
"I wonder what he's thinking."
"I've never had so much fun."
"I'm glad you're okay."
"I want it to be the present."
"That's what I want to know."
"Are you sure it was him?"
"I have been all my life."
"I'll tell you something good."
"But that was just a theory."
"Is this a test?"
"You're going to do something for me."
"Do you think you can do it?"
"I want us to get back together."
"That's how he does it."
"Are you sure this is it?"
"Is James Cole one of your patients?"
"Call me when you get this message."
"Look what you're making me do."
"What does all this have to do with it?"
"I only thought of you."
"Didn't you forget something?"
"I hope I did well."
"I'd bet my life on it."
"We are back to square one."
"Only a few were chosen to stay."
"I have the man for the job."
"You shouldn't think like that."
"You, what are you doing?"
"What are you doing?"
"I think I would remember that."
"Can I go?"
"She said she would be there."
"Let's see what we have here."
"That was nine years ago."
"Don't interfere in my private life."
"I'm here if you need me."
"My little finger told me so."
"Is there anything there?"
"I keep telling you."
"Who taught you how to do that?"
"You are better than me at everything."
"It's over, they took it."
"Can I see your ID?"
"I have to get out of this."
"It's good to see you all."
"Listen carefully to what I'm telling you."
"What will become of you?"
"Do you think this is a game?"
"What would you have done?"
"I think I can do it."
"No, I wasn't talking about that."
"That was two hours ago."
"Do you want to know what's going on?"
"How are things at school?"
"I mean what I said."
"Stay with me, please."
"Come with me if you want to live."
"Dad, can I ask you a question?"
"It's you I want to see."
"You know it's the truth."
"Do you think I'll believe you?"
"You weren't supposed to see this."
"It's true that he is handsome."
"How many questions does it usually take?"
"What do you have to say to that?"
"I never asked you."
"Is he talking to me?"
"Please let me go."
"Please let me go."
"That's when I knew."
"I've known you all my life."
"Keep doing what you're doing."
"The best driver I've seen?"
"No, I don't need anything."
"I'll see you later."
"That was twenty years ago."
"For the first time in my life."
"Every night it's the same thing."
"It's up to you to decide."
"This is what I don't understand."
"I can take you on my team."
"I found something interesting."
"That's very kind of you to say."
"I need to do something."
"We're going to do this the old-fashioned way."
"But all that is in the past."
"No, that's what I'm saying."
"Do you know what I want?"
"You wanted it."
"I need to know what happened."
"You never told me that."
"I have to get started."
"Where are you taking him?"
"What does she want from me?"
"There is more to it than that."
"Did you write this?"
"No, but you're going to tell me."
"I said I would think about it."
"You look good to me."
"He asked me to do it."
"The fresh air will do you good."
"Do you have something to tell us?"
"Who's next on the list?"
"I'm sure you're right."
"Is it a male or a female?"
"You're going to have to trust me."
"I cannot answer this question."
"My father was an exceptional man."
"How long have you known him?"
"I want to see this more closely."
"Do you know what she said?"
"I had never heard of it."
"How much time do you have left?"
"What's his last name?"
"I'm sure you are."
"What did we miss?"
"He has a wife and children."
"She always needs to feed."
"I did it for your own good."
"What are you doing here at this hour?"
"This is the purpose of my visit."
"I am delighted to meet you."
"I appreciate what you did."
"You're going to do just fine."
"Tell us what happened."
"You know what I'm thinking?"
"You are the only one I love."
"Send it to someone else."
"What are you doing, honey?"
"I don't think you understand."
"I'll tell your mother."
"I'm sorry, but it's true."
"It's not worth it."
"She must not know."
"It's because of my father."
"She looks healthy."
"That's what we said to each other."
"I talked to everyone."
"No one knows this better than me."
"I think we found it."
"Can you lend me some money?"
"And you are wiser than me."
"What do you think you know?"
"I was wondering what it was."
"We grew up in the same neighborhood."
"There are gunshots."
"He never knew his father."
"I want to see it with my own eyes."
"I think I have an idea."
"Can't you or don't you want to?"
"I have to know the truth."
"I would if I could."
"So what do you want me to do?"
"You're going to have to train your left hand."
"I have cash and cards."
"Don't you have any idea?"
"The idea crossed my mind."
"How long have you been here?"
"You haven't told anyone about this?"
"You didn't tell anyone about it?"
"She didn't say anything else?"
"No, I'm not going to do it."
"This is the second time this week."
"This is happening now."
"What did we find?"
"He has a sense of humor."
"Now you have your kid of a wife."
"Who knows what he's capable of?"
"Have you told anyone about this?"
"I can't really talk about it."
"I have a taxi waiting for me."
"Please try to understand."
"There was a small accident."
"What happened to your voice?"
"That's exactly what I believe."
"I gave it to him."
"Are you sure they're here?"
"It's good that you came."
"It's a gift from my daughter."
"I came to see how you were doing."
"I came to see how you were doing."
"I brought you some water."
"I'm going to the bathroom."
"I'm going to the bathroom."
"There are others here."
"He was all I had."
"I should have done this sooner."
"There's a first for everything."
"War is war."
"Are you the one who called me?"
"A songbird and an old hat."
"Maybe you are one too."
"I have two reservations for Key West."
"But here's what I'm going to do."
"Do you know why she did that?"
"I came to tell you something."
"What do I think about it?"
"What happened to the car?"
"He asked me to replace him."
"I can't ask you that."
"No, that's not it at all."
"What happened to your eye?"
"I've only ever loved you."
"I thought it was you."
"I thought it was you."
"It's the times that demand it."
"What, what is it?"
"I told you it was fine."
"More than you will ever know."
"I never told you that."
"You don't need them."
"I think someone is following me."
"But we didn't."
"There must be another way out."
"You are the one who should be congratulated."
"No, that can't be it."
"You can't say otherwise."
"I know, he told me."
"I know what we need."
"There is some truth in that."
"No, it wasn't an accident."
"What happens next?"
"I came as quickly as possible."
"What's so special about it?"
"You are the Ring-bearer."
"I'm going to be a little late."
"Tomorrow is a big day for you."
"Is there another solution?"
"Show them what you can do."
"I need you to stay here."
"I thought you were my friend."
"I thought you were my friend."
"What did you do to my son?"
"And what happened?"
"What brings you here?"
"Isn't that what we do?"
"No, I can't say that."
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"I'll have a glass of water."
"How many times do I have to repeat this?"
"Maybe it's not him."
"I'd better get back to it."
"You have something I want."
"So what are we looking for?"
"Do you mind if I sit down?"
"I always wanted to tell you."
"I had to tell you."
"What happened tonight?"
"It's time for prayer."
"Take the time you need."
"I want to go for a walk."
"How did it go this morning?"
"He is my son's father."
"What are you going to imagine?"
"Can I talk to you about something?"
"It's true that she is beautiful."
"No, I never thought about it."
"I would be happy to talk to him about it."
"You know I care about you."
"What happened to your wife?"
"Can I see you in my office?"
"Maybe you clean carpets."
"Tell mom I love her."
"What does this tell us?"
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"This is where I was born."
"And I'll tell you something else."
"What's over there?"
"What are you doing standing up?"
"I thought it was going well."
"Is there still time?"
"All of this is thanks to you."
"I'm happy where I am."
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"You don't remember me anymore?"
"She doesn't answer her cell phone."
"I made the decision to act."
"I thought we agreed."
"The council authorizes me to train you."
"I should have done it myself."
"I have never seen this woman."
"What happened last night?"
"What do you want me to do?"
"This is my life's work."
"Did you stay there all night?"
"It's like looking in a mirror."
"A term of courtesy in this establishment."
"I'll let you say goodbye."
"Have you ever been with a prince?"
"What can he do?"
"Did you find what you wanted?"
"Tell the children I love them."
"You have done me a great service."
"I already told you no."
"Because I am a good observer."
"What happened to my house?"
"It didn't happen that way."
"What do we have here?"
"I'm going to ask you to open it."
"After all he's done?"
"I'll see if it's available."
"Oh, I have something for you."
"What did you do to your hand?"
"Wait, what's going on?"
"You won't need this anymore."
"But we don't have time."
"I saw how you looked at her."
"You think I didn't understand?"
"Do you want to know how I did it?"
"Do you know who you're dealing with?"
"I only ask one thing of you."
"We have all the time in the world."
"It's you I'm asking."
"I didn't ask your opinion."
"What do you mean?"
"When I was little, on TV."
"Don't you want to go home?"
"Which port do they intend to embark from?"
"I had to tell someone."
"I have a long way to go."
"There has to be a first time for everything."
"There's going to be a storm."
"You caught his eye."
"That's all he had."
"We'll see each other later."
"It's time to get started."
"I think we should split up."
"Is that what you want?"
"Now there are beasts everywhere."
"This campaign is a game for them."
"I'm just doing my job."
"There are millions of them."
"I think I found it."
"Is this your way of apologizing?"
"I told you I'd be back."
"She didn't tell me anything about it."
"Do you think it's that easy?"
"There is a lot to do here."
"Tell me what you did."
"I'm ahead of you."
"That's what I thought."
"What happened between you?"
"I found out what it is."
"I'll be back in an hour or two."
"It's between my wife and me."
"What did you feel?"
"There must be one."
"I agree with you, the advice is."
"I'm glad you came."
"How long will he stay?"
"I chose a mortal life."
"I did as you said."
"I know you like him."
"I saw it in a movie."
"There were many deaths."
"We do what we have to do."
"She seems to be doing better."
"Where were you when it happened?"
"She looked me in the eyes."
"Haven't you been watching TV?"
"I see what's going on."
"What's with the gunshots?"
"Can I call, please?"
"It's just another day."
"I have a deal for you."
"How long have they been there?"
"I tell it like it is."
"My destiny will be that of our people."
"He is the light of my life."
"I saw him last week."
"That was my father's name."
"No, I've never seen them."
"Do you know what you're going to do?"
"I'll see him later."
"What do you think I did?"
"It's time to tell the truth."
"No, I have nothing to hide."
"We only did it once."
"Tell me if you accept my terms."
"Let's see what you look like."
"What am I doing?"
"Take a look at this."
"How can you be so sure?"
"I want to know what he knows."
"It's up to you to tell him."
"What can you do?"
"I hope you don't mind."
"I've never had a wife."
"No, it's not just that."
"But they didn't."
"He created your mind, your brain."
"It's time for her to get married."
"I think I can do it."
"I couldn't find anything else."
"The most exciting secret in the world."
"You've changed quite a bit too."
"That's why I chose you."
"Want to take a look?"
"As if I had a choice."
"I have to go to work."
"I forgot to tell you."
"My head is just spinning."
"What did they find?"
"Was I not clear enough?"
"I'm telling you I'm fine."
"When did you come back?"
"Politics is the art of the practical."
"That's how I feel too."
"But where are you going?"
"You've never heard of it?"
"I hope you slept well."
"There may be survivors."
"You tried to tell me."
"I'm in the bathroom."
"That's all that impresses them."
"I can't do anything more for you."
"That's what was wonderful."
"What is the word I am looking for?"
"As teeth go, so bones go."
"Over a year ago."
"I know what you're doing here."
"How do you think I feel?"
"You know that, don't you?"
"He's the man for the job."
"Yes, and they said your name."
"Do I have something on my face?"
"Open the door, please."
"What happened to my father?"
"Did she tell you where she was going?"
"I've never heard a story like this."
"My Lady, you need to eat."
"This is where we have to go."
"You have to feel that inside you."
"I see what's going on here."
"The little one is strong, that's for sure."
"Did I do that?"
"I said I was a cop."
"Actually, I write for cinema."
"Do you still love me?"
"I thought you should know that."
"He made fun of my old man."
"You're both working tonight."
"You haven't aged a day."
"It is my most precious possession."
"I have a mission for you."
"I feel closer to you."
"Is that what happened to you?"
"No, but I've heard about it."
"I tried to talk to you about it."
"I work for the Attorney General's office."
"It'll be okay, I promise."
"She was all I had."
"I've been waiting for you all day."
"It's an order from above."
"I want you to listen to me carefully."
"I'm sure we'll see each other again."
"I thought it was the right one."
"She looks in great shape."
"You're not a little girl anymore."
"I saw him last night."
"Is this someone from school?"
"We'll take you to the hospital."
"How far up the river are we going?"
"It is an honor to welcome you."
"I think that's my mother."
"You think I'll believe that?"
"Can I do anything for you?"
"I have to take care of some things."
"I have some things to tell you."
"Who told you to come here?"
"He was stabbed in the throat."
"I'll tell everyone."
"They live inside me?"
"Do what you do best."
"Have you seen anyone else?"
"I saw him through the window."
"I know you want to kiss me."
"That's what it seems to me."
"No, he didn't say it."
"She did this to herself."
"I just say what I think."
"How long has he been there?"
"How long has he been there?"
"What is it, my love?"
"It's your word against his."
"Are you holding up?"
"I'm glad you're back."
"I'm so glad to see you again."
"Someone grabbed him from the ground."
"The garrison of Rome sets up camp."
"I'll take him home."
"Is that really how you feel?"
"No, what are you doing?"
"War awaits you, not victory."
"There must be something else."
"It made me want to throw up."
"Are you with us or against us?"
"It's time for plan B."
"Do you think this is the boy?"
"My place and my future are here."
"Can you hear me?"
"I need to call my wife."
"Do you realize what you've done?"
"Call me if you find anything."
"Anyway, that's my opinion."
"I know what you've been through."
"It's really happening."
"I have to go to bed."
"How could he do this to me?"
"I have another one for you."
"Is this what you've become?"
"How many times do I have to say this?"
"I am a friend of your father."
"Of course she did."
"What do you think that means?"
"That's what we agreed."
"I need to talk to you before you leave.'"
"You said it was important."
"What, what's going on?"
"How did we get to this point?"
"He must know what he is doing."
"This is what I discovered."
"I never left the country."
"I've never seen anything like this before."
"The sweetest grapes on earth."
"Do you want to screw everything up?"
"When will it stop?"
"It's time to go."
"I wanted to tell you myself."
"What are you waiting for, Dad?"
"I've been around the world."
"I'm sure you're right."
"I'm watching it."
"I already told you, right?"
"I'm going to do it."
"We have the situation well under control."
"He is good, the Mountain is."
"Why are you so nice to me?"
"Why are you so nice to me?"
"It's true, I saw it."
"I know a lot about you."
"Your secret is safe with me."
"Is that what you want to know?"
"It was never a question."
"What was happening in your dream?"
"What exactly happened?"
"What did you do to my father?"
"I see you've met."
"It's as dark as an oven."
"Open your mouth, please."
"And you didn't do any of them."
"What does he think about it?"
"Give them bread and their freedom."
"Could I have a glass of water?"
"It's you I wanted to see."
"There are some very good ones."
"Hence the importance of his capture."
"This is the hardest part."
"I can see it in your eyes."
"No, I can't believe it."
"Can we talk about it when I get back?"
"Do you know where I can find it?"
"For once, we agree."
"I am the most virtuous in Rome."
"Now he wants us."
"He must be around here somewhere."
"You seem in a good mood."
"Did you get laid?"
"I prefer not to talk about that."
"The most pleasant miracle in the world."
"Did she say what she wanted?"
"Will they be able to penetrate their protective field?"
"You did what you wanted."
"What else do you want?"
"There's no question of taking the queen there."
"I think my eyes are better."
"What would I have done?"
"You'll have to run over me."
"No, we're not going to do that."
"We agreed, right?"
"Something happened here."
"Look what you did to him."
"I did what I wanted."
"How long have you lived here?"
"That's what the job requires."
"It's time I went."
"What do they want from us?"
"That's all I wish for."
"I know someone who does."
"If your number comes up, we'll find you."
"You can take me whenever you want."
"What made you decide?"
"What made you decide?"
"This is exactly what is needed."
"You have nothing else to say?"
"That's how you grow up."
"I took a look."
"Keep doing what you're doing."
"How will you determine who is homosexual?"
"What is the password?"
"I'm right next to you."
"If only I could do something."
"I need to speak to the commander for a moment."
"How long will it take for them to arrive?"
"What do I always say?"
"Remember what we said."
"How do you know it's him?"
"How do you know it's him?"
"It's good that you're back."
"It's like a fairy tale."
"I have the right to see him."
"I always trusted you."
"Have you seen her?"
"I know you need it."
"You can have whatever you want."
"I think it's better this way."
"As if I was going to tell you."
"I did what was necessary."
"Is that how you do it?"
"Just like old times, right?"
"It was a pleasure meeting you."
"Do you see what I did?"
"You know what I have to do."
"You can take your wives with you."
"I thought we were past that."
"I can see it on your face."
"Nobody knows we're here."
"She got what she wanted."
"We are doing it."
"You have to fly on your own."
"He's the one you need."
"There's something up there."
"She told me the same thing."
"Is this really what you want?"
"Is this really what you want?"
"It's my word against his."
"She didn't need it."
"I saw it on TV."
"That's who I was talking to."
"And then, I feel good here."
"Thank you for all you do."
"Thank you for all you do."
"I'm glad you called."
"That's what we do, right?"
"They also left you a CD."
"What the hell are you doing, old man?"
"I wonder what she wants."
"I wasn't up to it."
"When you're right, you're right."
"That's what makes it so charming."
"I told you to get up."
"I don't need it now."
"Is there one for me?"
"We have to get her out of there."
"I told you to be careful."
"Let me take a look."
"Let me take a look."
"It has the merit of being clear."
"It may already be the case."
"You'd better go home."
"Are you done with my wife?"
"Do you know what we need?"
"I believe I can do it."
"Do you know what it is?"
"Of course I saw her."
"I'll get you out of here."
"And it will start again, again and again."
"It's his sense of humor."
"He's not there either."
"What can I do for you, Inspector?"
"Yes, I have to go."
"After what you did to me?"
"Can you tell me where we're going?"
"We did the right thing."
"I didn't tell him that."
"It could have been anything."
"No one knows you're here."
"I saw you on television."
"Come down and show me your safe conduct."
"I should have told you about this before."
"Call me when you get this message."
"Are you sure it was him?"
"I heard what you were saying."
"She never told me anything."
"You have to get me out of here."
"You have to get me out of here."
"What do you do with it?"
"What was I imagining?"
"Was it a boy or a girl?"
"Did you take them?"
"It's a surprise, remember that."
"What if something happens to you?"
"I have to go get him."
"Did you give up?"
"Did you give up?"
"You can't do that here."
"I only saw him once."
"He did this to himself."
"I'm going to make you a star."
"If you only knew how much I love you."
"What does that imply?"
"Except it isn't."
"I have never seen a ballet."
"But we have to get out of here."
"No, we can't do that."
"It's my father's birthday."
"That's very kind of you."
"A drop in the ocean."
"On the other side of town."
"I've read some stuff about it."
"I like you both."
"You disobeyed a direct order."
"Come on, you can do better than that."
"What happened there?"
"We have plenty of time for that."
"Who told you to do it?"
"I just had a great idea."
"I just had a great idea."
"No, I don't have any money."
"Don't you have another idea?"
"I'm trying to tell you something."
"I think she's upstairs."
"But we need money."
"What are you asking me?"
"You tell me what's going on?"
"I wonder where it comes from."
"It's beyond my means."
"I told you to wait outside."
"I thought you did it."
"I know there are some."
"Give me everything you have."
"I have something to offer you."
"I need a drink."
"Of course, you named your sword."
"What do you offer me?"
"I need to see someone."
"Don't you want another one?"
"It was just like old times."
"Is that all you're saying?"
"Are you going to stay here all day?"
"Where's your sense of humor?"
"I'm so happy to see you again."
"You have to look at it like that."
"But it's you I want."
"There is a price on my head too."
"But I'll tell you one thing."
"Is that the case?"
"You need to eat something."
"And what do you feel?"
"I never thought it was possible."
"Was it worth it?"
"Do you want to know how I feel?"
"Do you want to know how I feel?"
"It is in my mother's name."
"Are you sure this is it?"
"Did you mean what you said?"
"Go see somewhere else if I'm there."
"You have an idea in mind."
"No one is more diligent than you."
"That's all I'll say."
"I will do what you tell me."
"And that's what happened."
"It's time for your medicine."
"What did I do to deserve this?"
"Water, please."
"You have the keys."
"I painted it."
"Thanks for getting me out of there."
"I knew you would agree."
"I knew I would find you here."
"You are the man for the job."
"If you have to leave, now is the time."
"We found what we were looking for."
"I'm going to make some calls."
"What do you think I'm going to do?"
"You're never home."
"Have you talked to your mother about this?"
"I want to do the right thing."
"This is the moment I've been waiting for."
"As if we needed that."
"I wonder what that means."
"I made a deal with them."
"I realize it now."
"It looks in good condition."
"What do we do, boss?"
"How did this happen?"
"What is it now?"
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"To talk and walk like us."
"That was years ago."
"There is something else at stake."
"Nobody knows you're here."
"I will do it if you do it."
"I want to go home."
"I have something important to do."
"It's a gift from my husband."
"How good it is to be free."
"I have so much to do."
"Looks like you need it."
"That seems like a good idea to me."
"He has his father's eyes."
"I'm glad I met you."
"Do you know anything about this?"
"I'm surprised you believe it."
"I had a great time tonight."
"He just wanted me to replace you."
"That's what I'm doing now."
"I'm going out to get some fresh air."
"You can stay as long as you want."
"Honey, I'm so proud of you."
"It's just the two of you?"
"It must be my lucky day."
"I never want to talk to you again."
"Maybe we should go."
"No, he didn't do that."
"I can't ask him that."
"I think I have the flu."
"What if it doesn't?"
"I apologize for being late."
"No, I can't go."
"No idea what it is."
"I put it back in its place."
"It was nice working with you."
"It was a pleasure meeting you."
"What are you hiding from us?"
"What happened to your eye?"
"I'm glad you came."
"She ended her life."
"I'm here because of you."
"Not a word, please."
"What does it cost you?"
"I know what happened to you."
"Everyone get involved."
"He was the one who hired me."
"Can you explain to me what's going on?"
"I will do whatever is necessary."
"I let everyone down."
"I have to tell you something."
"I will take care of it in due course."
"I just thought of something."
"Listen to my voice, come back to the light."
"I didn't say that either."
"Actually, there is something else."
"I need to be with you."
"One for you and one for me."
"No, it's never too late."
"What could it be?"
"Give your father a real kiss."
"I think we'll go."
"I know what we should do."
"I've taken up enough of your time."
"Are you sure that's all?"
"Who told you where I was?"
"Can we have a bigger army?"
"I think they called him Spartacus."
"As I am treated, I treat others."
"What is it, Dad?"
"What did you imagine?"
"Can I have some water?"
"What did you drink?"
"I came here to see you."
"Please don't say anything."
"You haven't changed your mind?"
"I just want us to be friends."
"I thought it was already done."
"It's good that you came."
"Thanks for saving my ass."
"I suggest you do the same."
"I'm sworn to secrecy."
"Maybe it's better this way."
"You think I won't do it?"
"You seem confident."
"You seem confident."
"This is a case of self-defense."
"I'll see if it's possible."
"How long have you known this?"
"It was nice to see you again."
"I think you should go."
"There are plenty of them around here."
"We can do this another time."
"Thank you for coming all this way."
"You can take whatever you want."
"He was the one who attacked me."
"You never know what might happen."
"But there are others."
"We'll see what he thinks."
"I have everything you want."
"She has her mother's eyes."
"I know what you meant."
"Glad you changed your mind."
"It's an old family recipe."
"She's the one who left me."
"She said it."
"The bigger the better."
"Have you spoken to him?"
"You should know that."
"It's the truth, I swear."
"That's what I have to say."
"I like it when the candles are lit."
"How is this good news?"
"How did you know it was me?"
"What did you eat?"
"I really want to kiss you."
"What's going on here?"
"I have to find a solution."
"I've been here for half an hour."
"I just need a second."
"But what is he doing?"
"Well, that's good news."
"Look what they gave me."
"No, it's not mine."
"How long have I been here?"
"They said it on TV."
"I am the head of security."
"What do they want from you?"
"The sun rises in an hour."
"What's in the box?"
"On the first day of my new life."
"That's what we planned."
"Look over here, please."
"I feel safe with you."
"She is the one who needs to be replaced."
"What happened to your head?"
"He has as many reasons as you do."
"It was the chance of a lifetime."
"No, I don't want money."
"We're halfway there."
"And I fucked both of them."
"I'd better get on with it."
"I have two men in the hospital."
"I made it myself."
"And the sooner the better."
"I was the one who asked him."
"Did you spend the night with her?"
"I'm sure he will."
"Did he do it?"
"No, we didn't."
"No, there weren't any."
"Give me everything you have."
"So there is hope."
"I need to know one thing."
"There's always something, right?"
"It's the first step that costs."
"I want him to go away."
"I have to go to class."
"Do you think you're old enough for that?"
"Are you sure it's there?"
"I heard what happened."
"I told the police everything."
"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
"If they are here, we will find them."
"What are you doing, son?"
"If only that were all."
"I'm in the middle of nowhere."
"What do you think that means?"
"She's here, isn't she?"
"Where are they taking him?"
"Do you know what I need?"
"That was an hour ago."
"Do you know what you did?"
"Take the time you need."
"Throw it into one of the black cells."
"Entry code, please."
"And I'll tell you something."
"I heard you the first time."
"How long will it take you?"
"What do you have again?"
"I take my work very seriously."
"Do you want to know what I do?"
"I want you to trust me."
"I've already told you about her."
"Where did you come from?"
"That's why I come."
"We need to take him to the hospital."
"The Force is with you, young Skywalker."
"It is an honor to serve you."
"I was the one who called him."
"Maybe I can do something."
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Call me if you change your mind."
"I took a shower this morning."
"I did some research on you."
"So what are you?"
"Baby, what's going on?"
"I'm glad you're here."
"But I have something for you."
"That's what families do."
"Oh, what's going on?"
"So what is it?"
"You better go."
"It only exists on paper."
"Your father and I were very close."
"I'll tell him you came by."
"I have something to do first."
"I didn't even touch her."
"And what does it say?"
"There's a word for that."
"Barry reported regularly to the minister."
"It's at the end of the street."
"Have you ever been with a woman?"
"It took you a long time."
"I've always been proud of you."
"I tell him you're here."
"I've never seen so many."
"You don't know how to spell 'bodyguard'?"
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"You asked me to do it."
"But we are the king's men."
"I've only been a cop for eight months."
"Who dares to paint my roses red?"
"From what I heard."
"He was a friend of my father."
"Pass it to me, please."
"Oh, you can do better than that."
"I took them on my knees."
"I don't remember that."
"You could have at least called me back."
"We have a big day ahead of us."
"Is this where you're from?"
"Is there an instruction manual?"
"It is a place full of promise."
"I wish he had heard it."
"It's not up to you to decide."
"Is it a boy or a girl?"
"Do you see anything?"
"He said he was fine."
"I know you care about her."
"I knew it would happen one day."
"I saw a century pass."
"Good job for such a young guy."
"And the Precious One wants to return to him."
"He knows what happened."
"It's only for a few days."
"There is a reason for that."
"I think it's a boy."
"Two suits and a bag of laundry."
"There is something in her."
"You know what you said."
"You can't afford it."
"That's what I told him."
"Do I have fleas in my eyes?"
"I'll put you on the right track."
"You have been declared sane."
"Can't you do something?"
"You reap what you sow."
"What have you done with my son?"
"Be careful what you say."
"We'll see that later."
"Of course I have one."
"I'll call you when it's done."
"What are you showing me?"
"Can I drink some water?"
"No, I wasn't aware."
"But I'll tell you something."
"He always made money from it."
"This is your friend talking to you."
"I'll take him to the hospital."
"You were everything I wanted."
"How did you get this magical power?"
"What is there to eat?"
"We have guys waiting for them."
"What are you doing next weekend?"
"Well, what are you doing?"
"I'd like you to meet Matthews, the controller."
"What do we tell them?"
"What did I miss?"
"As if it never happened."
"What's for dinner?"
"I think we can go."
"What is he going to say?"
"No one saw or heard anything."
"Is that what he said?"
"We found ourselves in the dark."
"What are you doing here at this hour?"
"I really wanted to see you."
"What can you tell me about her?"
"An anecdote about a drug deal."
"Maybe we'll see each other there."
"Yo, what the hell are you doing?"
"What are they doing to you?"
"You have to trust someone."
"I've never seen you here."
"How old was the black girl?"
"What do I look like?"
"Manipulator of thought and behavior."
"I hope he's okay."
"But that's what I want."
"I am stronger than bullets."
"Come on, I have something for you."
"Do you remember your grandmother?"
"Orange has a bullet in his stomach."
"I don't have a home anymore."
"It's up to you to find out."
"He slipped through my fingers."
"We have to go now."
"I work as fast as I can."
"Where did they go?"
"I am a friend of your father."
"I've never used it."
"What was so important?"
"I only saw one."
"I punished them both."
"Add courage to your new virtues."
"I said it was over."
"What if they aren't?"
"You know it's not going to happen."
"I'm going to sign you up for treatment."
"I love his hair thing."
"Yes, it's him and the woman."
"I thought you weren't coming."
"You're the one who scares me."
"You know what I understood?"
"Well, what are we waiting for?"
"He is always one step ahead."
"I'm glad you're home."
"How generous of me."
"Do you know what you could do?"
"Thank you for taking care of him."
"This is just the first step."
"Can I borrow some money from you?"
"There was a cop among us."
"Where are you taking us?"
"Do you think you can do it?"
"That's all I want."
"I thought you'd never ask."
"I saw this in a book."
"What betrayed me?"
"It takes a big army for that."
"I don't need a reason."
"And look what happened to him."
"There is a procedure to follow."
"Do you want a beer or something?"
"That's about to change."
"I know what you've been through."
"I thought you didn't want to."
"Please fasten your seatbelt."
"I can't remember."
"It's an honor to meet you."
"The best wine comes from Greece."
"I should have seen it sooner."
"Do you think I'm going to swallow that?"
"I guess you could say that."
"Yes, I remember it very well."
"Let's see what she does."
"How are things at home?"
"I remember my first night."
"I'm glad to hear from you."
"How kind of you."
"They have the right to do that?"
"My mission is to protect you."
"What will you say if someone comes?"
"We're going to do this for real."
"Please, it's important."
"I'm sure he's there."
"Do you think I have a chance?"
"It's been going on for a while."
"I am very happy for both of you."
"You can take it if you want."
"He made me do it."
"You never had a son."
"You're going to get a slice of it."
"I absolutely have to talk to you."
"What do you conclude from this?"
"I am one of his old friends."
"What's going on between you?"
"I think you already know that."
"I am a leaf in the wind."
"It seems like history is repeating itself."
"It's been going on for years."
"What will become of them?"
"Have you ever slept with a woman?"
"White and Pink, you're coming with me."
"I just got my nails done."
"I do what I know how to do."
"How are we going to get out of this?"
"I know how to manage on my own very well."
"He was shot in the chest."
"This is how we filter."
"You must let me see my son."
"You really want me to say that?"
"I know how it feels."
"It's good that you're back."
"What's up?"
"They got what they deserved."
"You eat when you are told to."
"And what do you want me to do?"
"Since I've existed, you've been there."
"I'll see what he knows."
"Come on Mr. White, you see this, right?"
"He held the victims in his arms."
"I appreciate what you did."
"You say you're a man?"
"The Marine Corps wants killers."
"Did you find anything interesting?"
"I've had enough of this kid."
"You made a new friend."
"But where are we going?"
"Did I tell you to open it?"
"That's all you are."
"It's the natural order of things."
"Could I have a glass of water?"
"When you are finished, enter your name."
"She's trying to tell us something."
"I have a wife and three children."
"But I have to do it."
"How could you do this to him?"
"That's what my father used to say."
"Please say something."
"I won't be the same there."
"Plus the kids who have to be taken for a walk."
"It's one of his good days."
"Don't you have anything better to do?"
"We have the right to be here."
"Do you know what they said?"
"So much has happened since then."
"Know all the details about these toilets."
"What a change he makes in a boy."
"You look like an angel."
"What happened in there?"
"I can see what's going on."
"Do you want to give your seat to Blake?"
"But there will be others."
"I've never been told that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience."
"Is that why you're calling?"
"I am the chief of police."
"She had nothing else to think about."
"You can and you will do it."
"I think she still loves him."
"I'll take care of all that."
"How did you know I would be here?"
"Yes, I've heard about you."
"Do you know what they did?"
"You know what I say?"
"He kept talking, too."
"That's what he wanted to hear."
"You never came to see me."
"I think he's hiding something."
"Riot in progress over food."
"Do you know what I should do?"
"Look what they did to me."
"It's nice to see you again."
"I know the day it will happen."
"That's what I did."
"It could come from anywhere."
"I'm going to tell you something important."
"That's what I felt."
"I've been there, to the slaughterhouse."
"It's like a fairy tale."
"I'll go get some parts, I'll be back."
"I knew you'd say that."
"From what I've read."
"Haven't I given you everything?"
"This is what your neighbors heard."
"We've heard a lot about you."
"I should have been by your side."
"I think I'll stay here."
"How long do I have to stay here?"
"Afterwards, I took care of him."
"And it will get better and better."
"She is the mother of my children."
"That's what happened."
"I thought it was over, Nina."
"I asked for it."
"Did you draw this?"
"I think you know the answer."
"I know what you want to do."
"I told you to wait for me."
"Did you have something to tell me?"
"You know very well who I am."
"Not after what we've been through."
"I am the man of the house."
"You weren't part of Operation Hastings."
"Black Swan, in place in five minutes."
"You have to take it south."
"How could you let this happen?"
"The great one who comes from the high."
"It's from the Mexican Panda."
"Who knows what happened?"
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
"How could you hide this from me?"
"That's it, I said it."
"I was there, I saw everything."
"No, but you have to fill out some paperwork."
"Real estate takes up all his time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the facts."
"I was about to give up."
"I live in a shitty world, yes."
"You don't have a girlfriend?"
"Please tell me."
"Our father is the Hand of the King."
"I'm glad I did it."
"How did it go for you?"
"I'm thinking about it."
"The stronger the better."
"I made a phone call."
"That's why I called you."
"Do you know something?"
"Do you know something?"
"I don't believe it either."
"Will I see you again?"
"It's nice of you to stop by."
"Someone with the skills to intervene."
"Do you want me to come with you?"
"I'm not going to answer that."
"You know what pisses me off?"
"I just don't want to."
"It's the only one I have."
"I'm going to give you a good lesson."
"What are you going to wear?"
"I took my car back to go home."
"This is what is happening here."
"That was very kind of you."
"I spoke to him last week."
"Please go home."
"How long have you been here?"
"Have I shown signs of improvement?"
"Until you get better."
"That's all I asked."
"I was just thinking."
"They prefer life to freedom."
"A bird had entered our cage."
"What are we doing now?"
"I don't want her to know."
"Do you have time to fix it?"
"We laughed so much."
"That was his plan all along."
"But she's just a child."
"Carlos, where is Lady E tonight?"
"Wait, what are you doing?"
"Yes, I guess you're right."
"You have to lower me into the tank."
"I could do whatever I wanted."
"Are you seeing anyone?"
"Is there anything else?"
"Do you want me to go get it?"
"Buy horses and a covered wagon."
"You should have told me about this before."
"You did the right thing."
"I have to go see him."
"I imagine when you were six."
"Who started talking about this?"
"He's one of us."
"You don't have to hide."
"You did a very good job."
"Believe me, it's for the best."
"This period of your life is over."
"What am I going to do for you?"
"I'm sure it's him."
"I've seen it somewhere before."
"And that was just the beginning."
"Who put that into your head?"
"She didn't come this morning."
"It feels good to talk about it."
"It's time for your lesson."
"She's the one chasing me."
"Don't you know who I am?"
"I still have some business to attend to."
"You can't say the same."
"That was my mother's name."
"What did he order?"
"Where have you been all this time?"
"You haven't figured it out yet?"
"What happens tomorrow?"
"I will tell you everything I know."
"Something could have happened to him."
"I have a family to support."
"We're going to have to split up."
"I would like to talk to you about something."
"I have to get ready for work."
"He's the guy from the mall."
"You were brave enough like that."
"It's up to me to tell him."
"And all I have here."
"I hope I cross the border."
"That's how I do it."
"So what do we say?"
"I left it in the car."
"Take this, they'll release gas."
"What did you understand?"
"I wasn't there for you."
"And what do I have?"
"There was another incident."
"What did he do this time?"
"Yes, I think you're right."
"A tourist attraction, I told you."
"I don't think she'll come."
"You're the one doing me a favor."
"I may have found something."
"What are you doing now?"
"I have something for you too."
"You can tell me."
"I didn't do that to him."
"And you know what it is?"
"If you are nice, I will be nice."
"She will tell you how to find Earth."
"She didn't tell anyone anything."
"You will see women of all sizes."
"It's very good for your health."
"I didn't take anything at all."
"Remember this day, little brother."
"I think it's mine."
"I want the same thing as you."
"Do you have someone in your life?"
"I turn over a hundred million a year."
"He knows a little about me."
"I never had a brother."
"Like I needed that."
"Have you told anyone about this?"
"What is she doing now?"
"And what do I want?"
"I only did it once."
"I think that's the best."
"I'll give it back to you when we leave."
"That's exactly what she wants."
"Do you trust me?"
"I want you to be my wife."
"What can I do for you, sir?"
"There is one thing left for me to do."
"You can do whatever you want."
"It looks very good to me."
"Find out what he wants."
"Someone has to make the first move."
"It started like that indeed."
"What would you like to do?"
"I have to go, I'll call you back."
"He wanted him to get out of it."
"I have a secret to tell you."
"I'm proud of you, my friend."
"Have you told anyone?"
"Haven't you read the newspaper?"
"You look great, honey."
"Are you in the infirmary this week?"
"I thought he was your friend."
"This thought crossed my mind."
"Of course, what is it?"
"Can't you see I'm working?"
"I want to see what it is."
"It's a bet like any other."
"That's where you have to go."
"But we have one thing in common."
"This is what I like to do."
"I just thought of something else."
"Dad, what is it?"
"I'll be here in half an hour."
"Where are my mother and father?"
"How was your weekend?"
"You know what you're getting into."
"I swear it's the truth."
"I think it's yours."
"What does he want to prove?"
"Whatever comes to mind."
"I'm delighted to finally meet you."
"I invited you to do it."
"Tell us what happened."
"She always brings it back."
"They have everything they need."
"He looks more and more like you."
"This is the tenth course correction."
"I had a very good day."
"What do you think I'm going to do?"
"How happy I am to see you."
"I'm so glad to see you."
"She chews, she chews all the time."
"They believe you, you're super cool."
"That's where I belong."
"But it was self-defense."
"You take your desires for reality."
"On top of the black building, on the corner."
"She was like a sister to me."
"Show that you have a pair."
"No, that's what I thought."
"I know it and you know it."
"Where were we?"
"I think we got it."
"I was told you were leaving."
"I love you and you love me."
"That's what people want."
"No, it was someone else."
"I was wondering what was going on."
"What you're doing is good."
"This is what I found."
"He knew everything from A to Z."
"I created it."
"It takes all sorts to make a world."
"There is a reason for everything."
"What are you talking about?"
"What did I win?"
"I threw it out the window."
"The Doug we're looking for is white."
"I had my whole life ahead of me."
"Did you have something to tell me?"
"I'm going to change your mind."
"She only served me three times."
"What do you want me to tell him?"
"If that's what you want."
"No one else can do it."
"How could you let this happen?"
"It's time to go to bed."
"Sorry you came for nothing."
"It's a police matter."
"We think he's going to come home now."
"It's really good to see you."
"I swore I wouldn't say anything."
"You have your father's eyes."
"Do you want me to call the cops?"
"I have so much to do."
"I'm leaving for a while."
"I probably work in shipping."
"Who could have done this since yesterday?"
"It's just above us."
"See you on the other side."
"They are doing it."
"There must be hundreds of them."
"How many times did you let it ring?"
"What is the reason for your visit?"
"She didn't say her name."
"What does he want from her?"
"I should be the one doing it."
"She told me to do it."
"I'll come as fast as I can."
"Because you're not."
"I did everything right."
"That's all that was left."
"What do you want to happen?"
"I have ants in my legs."
"I need you to love me."
"Are you sure it was her?"
"Don't test me."
"Everyone loves everyone."
"It was the beginning of the end."
"What, what do you want?"
"I'd better go."
"There's a storm coming."
"What's going on, baby?"
"Do you want to go to my place?"
"Do you think that's the case?"
"I'll go with you on this one."
"I have some money for you."
"A man destined for great things."
"I'll go take a look."
"I'm so glad to see you."
"Take you there, and leave you there."
"Percy, reach out and be kind."
"Come give us a hand."
"How do you want me to calm down?"
"I think you don't understand."
"What did you tell him about me?"
"Does that mean what I think it means?"
"I know you're not sleeping."
"She is my son's mother."
"I thought you'd never arrive."
"And you know it's true."
"You know she's my wife?"
"I thought you should know."
"Negroes should have their own chair."
"First, promise me you'll stay calm."
"Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself."
"No, I'm not sure."
"Your father would be very proud of you."
"You're coming home later and later."
"What happened to the child?"
"What are we wondering?"
"Hi, what's going on?"
"Don't forget who you're talking to."
"If you find some money, we'll share it."
"This is what I wanted to show you."
"I did something for you."
"Haven't we met before?"
"I'll introduce everyone to you."
"What's up there?"
"I always do what I say."
"I never wanted any of this."
"Look at what you give for them."
"We'll talk about it later."
"You're going to have to find better than that."
"This is where I was born."
"This is a big day for you."
"I thought you wouldn't come anymore."
"It suits you to say that."
"I know what to expect."
"I'll see you in half an hour."
"Do you have a hat or scarf?"
"That's the only thing that matters."
"What do you say to him?"
"How are we going to do this?"
"She has indeed flown away."
"She wasn't on the plane."
"Because I don't."
"Do you want to go together?"
"It's my life, not yours."
"I will do as you said."
"How long will it take me?"
"Did Marks close the front door?"
"I am one of them."
"That's what children do."
"That's where the money is."
"What's so funny?"
"I didn't ask him."
"I have something that belongs to you."
"I think we're all going."
"She is the woman of my life."
"Are you Bobby Caldwell's son?"
"To my right, above the cafe."
"There's something for everyone."
"I think we're done."
"Don't you want to go with me?"
"I'm glad you came."
"What have you done with my wife?"
"It is a great honor for me."
"This is where it gets tricky."
"He wants me to go away."
"I got what I deserved."
"You always give me good advice."
"He was the one who found us."
"They all think I'm her."
"What should I look at?"
"Is that what you wanted to know?"
"They'll extract it before dawn."
"What did you make?"
"To both."
"I know what he needs."
"This is exactly what we were looking for."
"Or rather what's left of it."
"Justice wants to take all of this from us."
"I just ask you to think about it."
"I went downstairs and you were gone."
"Where are we going now?"
"You can't think like that."
"We mostly have this kind of flash."
"You're taller than I thought."
"This is what partners do."
"It's between you and your father."
"Han, my boy, you are the best."
"That's what they do here."
"How can you say such a thing?"
"That was centuries ago."
"What's the name of this place?"
"You know what I'm talking about, right?"
"I need to get some fresh air."
"I almost got shot."
"Sorry to have brought you into this."
"It's someone from the inside."
"I want to do what I want."
"Did you find what you were looking for?"
"It wasn't about that."
"And they wanted it every month."
"I have something for you too."
"It was the middle of the night."
"What were you doing?"
"Because you need me."
"You see what I mean?"
"I also have an announcement to make."
"Did you do this?"
"But we must move forward."
"There can only be one left."
"Because I asked you to."
"I will give you an unforgettable time."
"I thought he was with you."
"I have a pretty good idea."
"By the way, send a bottle of champagne."
"We see what we want to see."
"The dining room window?"
"I'm very pleased to meet you."
"You think about her all the time."
"What is the meaning of life?"
"That's why it pays."
"I'm ready to do anything for you."
"I didn't dare ask you."
"Legends from elsewhere and stories for children."
"Perhaps I expressed myself badly."
"You must have heard of me."
"It's good that you came."
"I thought you forgot about me."
"I know what I want to do."
"Don't you have something to do?"
"We take care of each other."
"Do you know what that means?"
"Just lend me the Ring."
"You can stay as long as you want."
"That's what friends do."
"I'll keep an eye on him."
"What are we going to do with you?"
"It was a pleasure to see you again."
"I really like what you do."
"I will have to remember that."
"She was the mother of my child."
"I want to see you in my office."
"How do they know we're together?"
"Is there another woman?"
"Whatever happens, don't go out."
"I just want everything to be perfect."
"It's great that you're here."
"It was a century ago."
"I thought you might want to know."
"I will always be there to protect you."
"Nothing will change my mind."
"It's up to him to do it."
"Until I see you."
"What if I'm not?"
"Everyone knows everyone."
"I have to stay here."
"I think that's his name."
"I'll see you after the weekend."
"Be careful what you wish for."
"Didn't they tell you?"
"But I only trust him."
"Do you realize?"
"I tell everyone."
"What makes you smile?"
"I know you know."
"Are you thinking of someone in particular?"
"When it's personal, they have to hang up."
"You have to do what you have to do."
"Maybe he doesn't know."
"I thought we had a deal."
"Almost two weeks ago."
"I was sure it was you."
"Maybe it was the first time."
"There must be another entrance."
"Do you want the wing or the leg?"
"Do you recognize any of these men?"
"I mistook you for someone else."
"Have you ever done boxing?"
"Another glass, please."
"Are we allowed to be here?"
"Let's ask her what she wants to do."
"She's not here either."
"I'll explain when we see each other."
"She had nowhere to go."
"This is the most likely location."
"I'll tell you the truth, darling."
"Please accept my apologies."
"I thought you might want it."
"The answer to your question is yes."
"That's what scares me."
"You've gained a little weight."
"You know what would make me happy?"
"What did I see?"
"I'm the one who should be thanking you."
"It was you I called."
"There is still hope for you."
"The question does not even arise."
"Who's tough?"
"With great power comes great responsibility."
"I dreamed about you last night."
"Hi, what are you doing?"
"He takes the last flight to Miami."
"Who am I talking to?"
"Do you think we can do it?"
"We have to prevent that, right?"
"Are you sure it's her?"
"No, it must be towards the end."
"How long have you been married?"
"And I wanted you to know that."
"Do you know where I can find it?"
"I'm glad it's you."
"I'm glad it's you."
"It's society that wants it."
"It'll take us half an hour."
"What did you buy?"
"It's from all of us."
"It slipped my mind."
"You can't ask me that."
"I'll give you a little advice."
"First, I just had to get out of there."
"And that's you saying that?"
"Dominic said it was good."
"What had he done?"
"You look very fit."
"I hope I don't see you here again."
"I'm surprised to see you here."
"No, I don't want that."
"What do I have?"
"I've always taken care of you."
"Did you write it?"
"Two men outside, one at the entrance."
"This is hospital policy."
"I told you on the phone."
"It's time to go to bed."
"Did she put you in this?"
"Did you tell the police?"
"I tried to get him released."
"I have a busy schedule."
"This is my husband's car."
"I hope it doesn't come to that."
"You did a very good job."
"Looks like you're having fun."
"Do you want to see my ID card?"
"That's what you imagine."
"Because it's not his eyes."
"Is it like this every night?"
"How many times do you have to tell yourself?"
"So what's going on here?"
"Do you know who this guy is?"
"I have something to say too."
"I don't want to think about that."
"You can have me wherever you want."
"Where are we with our accommodation?"
"I just want us to be together."
"Did you see or hear anything?"
"I'm the one who's going to get you."
"Here's how we're going to do it."
"It was nice to see you again."
"Get that into your head."
"I've had enough of you two."
"It enhances the images they receive."
"I have a bullet in my stomach."
"I want to hear what he says."
"We have to find a solution."
"And I know you love me."
"But at least there are some."
"This is where I need to be."
"I had my breasts done."
"No, she didn't do that."
"What do you want me to tell them?"
"You don't have to answer."
"Southerners are welcome here."
"Since when do you give me orders?"
"Please do something."
"I heard this on the radio."
"I hope you have fun."
"Look what I have for you."
"What happened to the money?"
"I have never been so proud."
"You know what's at stake."
"It's my wife's birthday."
"What could we do?"
"What could we do?"
"I see what happened."
"Where do you think you are?"
"How are things going on your end?"
"My camp now is me."
"Whatever the price to pay."
"The fresh air will do you good."
"I have often asked myself this question."
"So what are you talking about?"
"What is she talking about?"
"I thought we told each other everything."
"But don't kid yourself."
"It's worth a try, right?"
"Each piece is unique, as is the fiber."
"I knew you were going to say that."
"What do you want to drink?"
"I have to go."
"This guy is a closed case."
"We found this in his pocket."
"So what will happen?"
"You do what you want with it."
"My father didn't agree."
"A little outside the city."
"I'll do anything for you."
"It's him, I'm sure of it."
"And I have a gift for you."
"This is my life's work."
"It was a gift from my mother."
"Is it me who has to be zen?"
"You talk about it like a game."
"What if I don't want it?"
"I need to take stock."
"But you didn't go."
"We had a good time together."
"I want to know how you feel."
"What did she see?"
"Was it a male or female voice?"
"Can't you stay a little longer?"
"Oh, it's good to see you."
"I'll get him some water."
"I look forward to hearing your story."
"Do you really believe what you say?"
"We met on the plane."
"I left them in the car."
"You have to see something."
"First time I've heard of it."
"You promised you wouldn't say anything."
"Thanks for keeping me updated."
"I'll do it later."
"You can't just stand there."
"I kept my end of the bargain."
"Please show her in."
"I take what I'm given."
"An unidentified individual at the window."
"Do you want us to leave?"
"It's just marked in the files."
"I did it for years."
"Let me make a call."
"Let me make a call."
"Others must find their own way."
"Our source at the bank called."
"I know what she said."
"I'm twice your age."
"I'm taking the last flight to Miami."
"The penultimate shot, there were four of us."
"That's what my mother used to say."
"What's in it for you?"
"It's interesting to read your reactions."
"It happened a long time ago."
"I'll see you on the other side."
"It just occurred to me."
"They do pattern recognition."
"You should have gone to the doctor."
"It took longer than expected."
"And you know I love you."
"It's a small price to pay."
"I have things to do here."
"Put your arm around my neck."
"But there is another way."
"You sure seem like it."
"So we will have little time together."
"How do you want me to do that?"
"I know you like me."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming."
"Is this someone you know?"
"There must be another way."
"Did you invite him?"
"You can't do that to him."
"I thought we were on the same side."
"He was always kind to me."
"Do you know what they're going to do?"
"No, there is nothing here."
"I'll be there in half an hour."
"That's what fathers do."
"I want to make things clear."
"You see, you're a born runner."
"Is this what you're going to wear?"
"That's what adults do."
"I think it's time."
"Do you have any change on you?"
"We see what that resulted in."
"That's exactly what you are."
"They are right above us."
"Gotham needs its real hero."
"Don't apologize to me."
"Sounds good to me."
"Mulder, what are you doing?"
"You say that to please me."
"I can take care of it myself."
"It was your mother's idea."
"What would that mean?"
"Hey, you got up early."
"Tell me what I need to know."
"You stepped on my foot."
"She is in the bathroom."
"A casino boss is shot dead."
"Have you spoken to the police about this?"
"Yes, I think it will be fine."
"I'll call you one of these days."
"Is that what you're asking me?"
"Are you sure you want to go?"
"What does he want from us?"
"Where did she go?"
"Where did she go?"
"That's all she has."
"Are you making decisions for him?"
"What a beautiful day, isn't it?"
"I won a module in the game."
"What can you do about it?"
"Those in favor, raise your hands."
"I'll get you another one."
"Want to take a look?"
"I thought she was with you."
"This is how I feel now."
"How do you know what to do?"
"I think I saw it."
"Please watch over him."
"I took you for a friend."
"There's water there."
"A guy across the street, in the park."
"I want to be able to trust you."
"I need to talk to him about it."
"Do with me what you will."
"All of that was just me."
"I thought it was the woman."
"Okay, what do we have?"
"I'm glad you came."
"We'll deal with them later."
"If you know something, say it."
"If you know something, please tell us."
"Because I'm proud of you."
"I think that's where it comes from."
"Where is the body supposed to be?"
"So where are they?"
"Can I sit down?"
"Please exit the vehicle."
"I have a wife and children."
"It's story time."
"No more than I love mine."
"Is that what you saw?"
"I thought he was a friend."
"Is this your way of getting revenge?"
"Give him a chance to recover."
"You don't want me?"
"It's time for his lesson."
"Let me take a look."
"Nor that we are old friends."
"What is he doing there?"
"There is nothing good."
"I thought you were in Rome."
"He's on his way to the hospital."
"Do you think we have a choice?"
"This is the other side of the coin."
"It's going to be a breeze."
"Have you seen anyone else?"
"You should have thought of this sooner."
"They will know that I was with you."
"It's the only one I have."
"Was there anyone with you?"
"I did what you asked."
"Where have you been all this time?"
"What is it, my little one?"
"She is the mother of my child."
"Is there more than one?"
"I'll be with you in a minute."
"I thought you might want to know."
"Do you think I'm making this all up?"
"Did you forget to buy the newspaper?"
"It takes time to discover it."
"Thus began my policy of conquest."
"Remember what I said."
"I did this for your own good."
"I thought 'Gretchen Ross' was pretty cool."
"I need to take some liquid."
"Remember to bring two handbags."
"The one that will be my birthday present."
"No, they can't say it yet."
"I don't ask myself that question anymore."
"I thought that was the case."
"I saw them under the bridge."
"Once he came back, he played small."
"I'm glad you stopped by."
"I thought we got along well."
"Team three takes care of the fish."
"I think they were kidnapped."
"But what does this mean?"
"Can I ask you a theoretical question?"
"And now he's gone."
"Any idea who it could be?"
"No, I don't remember anything."
"It looks like they're leaving."
"There are more and more of them."
"I will be sure to tell him."
"Wait, what's going on?"
"I have never seen the sea."
"Have you given up?"
"What do they mean?"
"I hope so."
"Did you hear a gunshot?"
"But Colonel is also an order."
"I saw you at the funeral."
"We need to move up a gear."
"The Comedian was a bit of both."
"Yeah, I think you're right."
"She takes it to her plastic surgeon."
"If that's what he wants."
"Do you know where I could find it?"
"I've never had so much fun."
"They took him to the hospital."
"Is there anything we can do for you?"
"It's in the air."
"What's next?"
"That's our daughter's name."
"Because she asked me to."
"That's what you know how to do."
"I don't know, what do you think?"
"I can't even think about it."
"Sounds like a superhero name."
"She shows my card all the time."
"I just spoke to the police."
"I found this in his room."
"Just answer yes or no."
"What is the purpose of photography?"
"I said not to move."
"We greet each other when we pass each other."
"This is the hospital's rule."
"I would get a B or a B-."
"That's what I don't understand."
"I can do this all night."
"She waves her paws to turn around."
"I thought it was a legend."
"What do you do with it?"
"What did you do to your hair?"
"You know what I wonder?"
"I appreciate your cooperation."
"It is a revolution of the mind."
"They are still fighting over their suitcases."
"The lover said something."
"But I know he's there."
"I'll see what we have."
"Do you know what I did?"
"I was the one who pushed him."
"You know, the guy who writes to me?"
"There are rules to follow."
"We are all children of God."
"No, this is not a test."
"It's time for my walk."
"But there's more to it than that."
"It's meeting time."
"There are only women."
"I have some paperwork to do."
"No, she didn't tell me anything."
"I'm on the corner."
"I'm talking to you."
"Do you know where we can find it?"
"It's good to have you here."
"He is a good friend of mine."
"Someone left the door open."
"No, one year of celebration is enough."
"Hey does it come with the crate?"
"I never asked myself the question."
"I used to come often when we were in a team."
"How does he know so much about me?"
"Katie's killers, evidence in hand."
"I have news on the Phantom."
"My husband brought it back from Japan."
"You weren't supposed to see this."
"It belongs to us and we want it."
"I wondered where he had gone."
"How long have we been here?"
"Say what you don't say."
"Come give me a hand."
"Uh, what is it?"
"How long have I been here?"
"They will come and eat out of your hand."
"And I have a family to support."
"I think it's a girl."
"All of Europe will hear about this."
"Place an 'X' in the appropriate place."
"What are you going to do with all this?"
"What did you do to my daughter?"
"No, I'm the one who apologizes."
"What is he doing?"
"What is he doing here?"
"No, it's not mine."
"I learned what happened."
"I have something to tell him."
"At least I had that chance."
"The bigger the better."
"It will be convenient to find your way around."
"You know very well who I am."
"No, she didn't say it."
"Do I have something between my teeth?"
"They'll get our skin for this thing."
"You must hear us all the time."
"You look good, Adrian."
"Is that what you were going to say?"
"I have other errands to run."
"I have so many questions to ask."
"Come see the rest of the family."
"I like things as they are."
"Where is Mrs. Chan going at this time?"
"I forgot you were here."
"But I want something in return."
"I think you look good together."
"They are looking for beer."
"You just have to tell me."
"He may have seen something."
"I have a sense of humor."
"You see what I meant?"
"We'll do it your way."
"Where are we going to go?"
"I was given a second chance."
"We'll see if you like it."
"I am delighted to meet you."
"I will be forever grateful to him."
"You have made great profits from it."
"I think I can fix this."
"It's in my purse."
"How many times do I have to repeat it?"
"Would you excuse us for a moment?"
"No, I'm too old for that."
"I need your full attention."
"I think it's very good."
"She's fine where she is."
"Nothing like a good beer."
"We'll live longer, in any case."
"What's your last name?"
"What are you doing outside?"
"This is the strength of the human heart."
"It is a pleasure to welcome you."
"Is that what you meant?"
"I'll make Eve and Diane wait."
"I'm going to go in and eliminate the target."
"I love her and she loves me."
"How could you hide it from me?"
"Everyone is at their posts."
"I'm just doing my job."
"You must take me for someone else."
"She has nothing to do with it."
"He'll never expect that."
"I know it matters to you."
"What else did you tell him?"
"Do you think they saw us?"
"Everyone is laughing at you."
"Until it's ready."
"I already have a team there."
"Do you really think this will work?"
"I have a wife and a child."
"We've done some big things together."
"No, there's more to it than that."
"I just need a moment."
"I'm going to need a minute."
"I flipped a coin."
"Let us be silent and swift as shadows."
"That's what I planned."
"You know what I don't understand?"
"You know I can do it."
"And there will be others."
"No, I didn't think about that."
"But what are you looking for?"
"I came of my own free will."
"My plan ended with the Jeep."
"What do doctors say about the head?"
"Well, that's a good thing."
"She's awesome, isn't she?"
"I said I understood."
"That's well said, Mr. Hammer."
"He absolutely has to be ready."
"This time you came as a master."
"It's mainly to get some fresh air."
"It's my word against yours."
"And it's because of me."
"I have a business meeting."
"It's your wedding day."
"I don't remember them."
"Don't you have anything else to do?"
"With Tony it's always a party."
"I could always count on you."
"I kicked him out."
"Think about what we could do."
"I think I can't."
"I'd better do it."
"I recognize the sounds of the street."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please."
"Thank you for inviting me to dinner."
"He makes more puns."
"What are you still doing?"
"He knew Nicky had a microphone."
"Everything is fine, you are safe."
"But you know who did it."
"This is what we needed."
"Mom, I need to talk to you."
"I want you to look at the screen."
"That's what I do, right?"
"At his house, I found clues."
"Yes, Dad, you told us."
"No, I haven't decided yet."
"Are you thinking about me?"
"I must be able to do something."
"She gives me goosebumps."
"I give you what you want."
"That's very thoughtful of you."
"Since the other night, I mean?"
"That's what my father says."
"Sorry to have to break it to you."
"The magician shows you an ordinary thing."
"Please leave a message."
"I have something else to tell you."
"I had never seen her before."
"Here or there, same thing."
"Sorry about what happened."
"I wonder what they are talking about."
"But I've never been there."
"I'm sorry about that."
"I hope that doesn't happen."
"What makes you laugh?"
"The richest man in the world."
"The Ring of Power within my grasp."
"After what you did to me?"
"You don't know anything?"
"What happened to your parents?"
"Who can no longer access the system?"
"I weigh more than all of you put together."
"If there is a next time."
"A spear coming out of the chest."
"I'd better go."
"I'm going to make myself comfortable."
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"I never really thought about it."
"Look what she did to herself."
"I'm glad you're happy."
"How did you know where I was?"
"And you know I'm right."
"And what does he feel for her?"
"Is that what scares you?"
"You think about it and call me?"
"I can call you whenever I want."
"I think about her every day."
"Can't we go to your house?"
"It's time for us to go."
"I've been waiting for an hour."
"I want you to get out of here."
"I'm glad you came."
"How long do I have to stay here?"
"And you have that in your chest?"
"I'm glad to see you here."
"You and I have a lot in common."
"I decide, not you."
"I just wanted to wish you good luck."
"Did she have an argument with a customer?"
"I came to bring you a check."
"He's talking to you."
"This is my brother's car."
"On the other side of the square."
"Where is the rest of the money?"
"We do the best we can."
"We all have something to hide."
"I said stay in the car."
"Look what he gave me."
"I'm talking about your family, Donnie."
"She was the one who called me."
"I really appreciate what you do."
"Thank you for coming to my rescue."
"Can I say whatever I want?"
"No, what are you talking about?"
"I think I have one."
"They put it in a bag."
"I already have something planned."
"With everything we've done?"
"You are a triple agent in fact."
"What does she want from him?"
"I do what I like."
"I'll wake you up when they're done."
"I'll give you a hand."
"I was with you in the meadow."
"There is milk in the fridge."
"We did well to come here."
"This is my mother's car."
"There will be something for everyone."
"Just do what I tell you."
"What's going on?"
"We went around the world."
"Don't you believe in your people?"
"You never told me."
"Of course I can see you."
"This is what is written here."
"You look great."
"What are you doing there?"
"It's time for your medication."
"She's right, the party is over."
"I never told you."
"For them, he was the star."
"It was nice working with you."
"I never got a response."
"I realized something."
"Glad to see you're doing well."
"I put her away."
"You're the only one who knows."
"They needed a man they could trust."
"A hot dog, please."
"What happened to your nose?"
"They should be leaving soon."
"I'll take you back to your father."
"A new stage of your journey begins."
"But I've never seen him."
"I'll sign anything you want."
"Should I tell you about your father?"
"I am very happy to see you."
"A miracle has just happened."
"I've always been lucky."
"You better come with me."
"I can't go now."
"Kids, we're going to the hotel."
"I wanted to talk to you about it first."
"Why do I have to explain things to you?"
"Actually, there are two."
"It looks like she knew the shooter."
"Am I going to pay for this all my life?"
"It's because of money."
"I have a lot of love to give."
"You pinched a certain Ray Harris."
"The book describes their movements, their smell."
"And that goes for everyone."
"What was the nature of your relationship?"
"From the bottom of my heart, I greet you."
"I think it's my turn."
"Where did you come from?"
"It's almost dinner time."
"I'll send you a piece of soap."
"I have big plans for you."
"Look what they did to him."
"Look what they did to him."
"You will have everything you want."
"I'm tired of this place."
"What memories do you have of your father?"
"I'm all she has."
"Guys, look what I got."
"So we can't prevent this?"
"What if they don't make it?"
"I saw him the other day."
"I have to go now."
"We had a great time."
"What caused this?"
"Please come to the point."
"I have a good one for you."
"That's how it works."
"They are mine, I take them."
"They blamed everything on him."
"All right, see you later."
"You didn't change the locks?"
"It's good to see you smile."
"Once again, please."
"It would be great if it were you."
"His bullets go over the fence."
"Now the Ring has brought him here."
"You need to rebuild your schedule."
"I just need a few days."
"I think we're done."
"I want to do something for you."
"I have to get back to the office."
"It feels like Christmas morning."
"It's like we're brothers."
"Was there anyone with him?"
"Is anyone home?"
"Do you see what's happening?"
"You are the only one who knows."
"And I did it for you."
"Where is he holding her?"
"What happened?"
"Are you in on it, or not?"
"Only what can happen happens."
"That would be something to ask Mr. Rand."
"What about the other one?"
"It's even better in the dark."
"It took me a while to understand."
"I just need it."
"That's it, laugh at me."
"There are ten years of waiting."
"Don't you want a normal life?"
"They will return for the quarter-finals."
"No one respects the forest anymore."
"I needed the tax deduction."
"I thought we had an agreement."
"Okay, here's what we're going to do."
"Nothing is more important than that."
"Ivan, what is it?"
"I learned how to use it."
"His power is growing, isn't it?"
"But what are you?"
"I remember giving it to him."
"Raise your arms, please."
"I had to become something else."
"Every living thing follows an established path."
"This is your captain speaking."
"How long has it been there?"
"This is my father's office."
"You were like a son to me."
"What's left for us to eat?"
"She is a very impressive young person."
"What's good about it?"
"It does, however, justify questioning him."
"Let's get this straight."
"That's what matters most."
"Yes, that's a very good idea."
"I give him a hand."
"Do you realize how lucky you are?"
"The world is changing."
"I never asked you that."
"The rescue team is on its way."
"You looked after me so well."
"The one who gave you this jewel."
"What the hell are you doing, Tyler?"
"I told him to go."
"I'll try to find something."
"I hope it still fits me."
"Who told you to come here?"
"Look what I did to you."
"I have to tell you, for the future."
"You wanted to undress me and kiss me."
"You have a sense of humor."
"Is your mother here?"
"Please tell me."
"Tell me who did this to you."
"I think you know the answer."
"He is one of my best friends."
"Everyone will know."
"People make all kinds of plans."
"Do I have to tell you again?"
"It's just flesh."
"This is the end of the road."
"Less than a day ahead of us."
"Do you have money for your milk?"
"I want you to close your eyes."
"I have a wife waiting for me."
"I love you and you know it."
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"How do you know if you're telling the truth?"
"Just tell me what you want."
"What would you have done in my place?"
"Is that all you came for?"
"Is that how you see me?"
"Is that what you want?"
"At least, that's what I thought."
"And you think it's me?"
"Did you find what you were looking for?"
"Do you believe in time travel?"
"I'll join you as soon as I can."
"I said what I knew."
"I told you it would work."
"I wonder how this happened."
"You will, won't you?"
"I'm really proud of you."
"I'll be back in a minute."
"How long will it take you?"
"You should take a look."
"I want you to trust me."
"What gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?"
"I've done a little bit of everything."
"I have something in my eye."
"You have white and pink."
"It's a mix of martial arts."
"It makes us a lot of money."
"That's what you do, right?"
"How old is Grandma Death?"
"It's time for my nap."
"Janey Slater, Manhattan's ex-girlfriend."
"Do you still love me?"
"I want to talk to you about Ray Harris."
"Your little games no longer amuse them."
"I'll give you another chance."
"I'll get the first aid kit."
"Not yet, anyway."
"I will never come to the dark side."
"You have to trust me."
"Gotham needs a real hero."
"Do you know who you are dealing with?"
"You have to give the order."
"I'll give them back to you next month."
"She wasn't there this morning."
"Go ahead, lift it up, make a little effort."
"Doctor says the treatment is simple."
"I'm looking forward to it."
"You are the best dad in the world."
"Do I have a brother?"
"You are a truly exciting person."
"I'm ahead of you."
"That's what he means."
"What is it, big guy?"
"There was water everywhere."
"I promise you it will be okay."
"It's hunting season."
"He was the best of us."
"What did you want for that Christmas?"
"I never asked you."
"He does this to everyone."
"How many months are you?"
"We can talk now, if you want."
"What's going on?"
"Until I met you."
"How far are you willing to go?"
"Thank you for participating in our exercise."
"She will never be the same again."
"You know what I noticed?"
"You must answer when I speak to you."
"Is this what you want to be?"
"Did you find what you wanted?"
"Who told you to do it?"
"The cop car is cool."
"That way we were able to talk to each other."
"I also have a gift for you."
"What was that car thing about?"
"Does everyone know what they have to do?"
"I'm replacing someone for the evening."
"All this means nothing."
"What makes you happy?"
"I told you to let it go."
"Do you see what you're doing to him?"
"I'm glad to see you too."
"You know what I forgot?"
"Our mission is to deliver justice."
"What are you doing, Mom?"
"And you, how are you doing?"
"I designed it."
"We'll squeeze them into the car."
"You're Sally Jupiter's daughter."
"When are we getting married?"
"This may be the best solution."
"What is it, my angel?"
"She's not safe here."
"That, my friend, is a pint."
"Do I matter so little?"
"Just a moment, please."
"I stuck her in a door."
"I have to get rid of it."
"I think he did."
"The finish line is in sight."
"What do you think of your mother now?"
"It's because we love you."
"Haven't you been told anything yet?"
"I need stitches."
"What happened to your glasses?"
"You think I haven't tried?"
"It's good to feel useful."
"I'm talking to you about school, Donnie."
"If you want to call it that."
"We'll meet back here in an hour."
"I need to eat something."
"What's for dessert?"
"I don't need this anymore."
"I think he likes me."
"I want you to take my place."
"It was you I came to see."
"You said that."
"There are divers in the park."
"You know exactly what I'm talking about."
"I think we'll find out."
"How much time do you need?"
"You don't have long left."
"Did you see how he looked at me?"
"Don't you want to go get some ice cream?"
"I forgot my toothbrush."
"Just like your audience with the Senate."
"I will give them to him when he returns."
"It's late, I have to go."
"That's what you did."
"Are you ready to party?"
"Where is he taking her?"
"You know I love you very much."
"I'll show you how it works."
"Everyone who spreads the word."
"There must be another one."
"There are two kinds of people."
"And the beatings she received?"
"What does he want to do?"
"You have just created a new item."
"Are you discovering a bit of humanity in yourself?"
"You will do what I tell you."
"In the interest of science, let's say."
"You know how much I love my family."
"The Force is strong in your family."
"There must be another access."
"Because it's important to me."
"Do you have any pictures to give me?"
"You can keep it if you want."
"I'm glad you came."
"I'm glad you came."
"Do you know what happened to me?"
"I hid it in my trunk."
"What are you going to wear?"
"Are you sure he's here?"
"Marriage is good, isn't it?"
"There might be some mail."
"Forgive me for doubting you."
"Is there hope?"
"That's how I like it."
"I have a big surprise for you."
"Love is a battlefield."
"I have the beginning of a story."
"You'll tell me if it worked."
"Your son gave us shelter."
"What do you do then?"
"I woke up, he was there."
"I have something to offer you."
"It's the only one I know."
"What does it bring you?"
"What's in it for you?"
"That's what I wanted to tell you."
"What are you two talking about?"
"Buffy is like no one else."
"I want to be part of your life."
"There's an app for that."
"I like it when you talk like that."
"They blamed everything on me."
"I'll see where he is."
"And how long will it take?"
"Do you want me to call a taxi?"
"I'll pick her up from work."
"Does this suit both of you?"
"Do you have something to ask me?"
"Did you get your hair cut?"
"What if she misses church too?"
"You don't look like him at all."
"Thank God you are safe and sound."
"Come with me, please."
"He has something to tell you."
"Ah Ping wrote to me from Singapore."
"You're flying to L.A."
"This is what he told me."
"What's in it for me?"
"I swear, I don't know."
"Thank you both for coming."
"Where do I come from?"
"Are you offering me a bribe?"
"I think you should apologize."
"No one else has access to it."
"But a lot of things have changed."
"We have time for that one."
"You need to take shelter."
"I have a stable relationship or almost."
"But you have to trust me."
"I hope I'm not interrupting anything."
"I'll start with a little massage."
"I have big plans for him."
"I'm telling you, that's all."
"What is happiness for you?"
"He protects us, he protects people."
"But it proves that the system works."
"It was several months ago."
"For once, I agree."
"I think he's looking for the queen."
"Can we know what you are doing?"
"Is it stimulating enough?"
"She was the strongest of the trio."
"Can I use your bathroom?"
"This is where you come from."
"Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
"I'll never be good at baseball."
"I have a good plan for you."
"No, but it's a good idea."
"She has no business being there."
"We'll bring you back to life."
"If you think it's better."
"This is one of them."
"I like your haircut."
"And the boy will return to his forest."
"How long will I stay here?"
"They leave, and you let them."
"We will see the flames from very far away."
"That's what matters to me."
"I promise I will pay you back."
"We'll draw straws."
"We stay and do it."
"Because you don't want to."
"He's the sheriff's brother-in-law."
"Don't make a big deal out of it."
"Han will cut the energy field."
"I love you both so much."
"It's not just us."
"Do you have what you need?"
"How do you think I feel?"
"How do you think I feel?"
"But you can't go there."
"Ah, you need some new clothes."
"What do you want to do in life?"
"I hope you like it."
"I will give you whatever you want."
"I did what was right."
"I only have one thing to say."
"I need more information."
"It's good to have a fan."
"You're throwing your life away."
"I have to go back to the street."
"We have all the time in the world."
"What am I doing here?"
"The girl I told you about."
"Did you have a good weekend?"
"I have absolute confidence in him."
"I told you to wait for me."
"You have something I want."
"Did you say 'please'?"
"Do you think you could do that?"
"I just got your message."
"As if I were going to tell you."
"Maybe we'll see each other again one day."
"Wait here, I'll be right back."
"He speaks French and German."
"How about a nightcap?"
"I have to talk to my husband about this."
"Maybe he knows something."
"What happened to your father?"
"I want to be sure I understand."
"So, do you like the bird?"
"Open the trunk, please."
"You can ask me anything."
"The cabin door is open and locked."
"No, I don't want to know."
"It's flu season."
"I found you."
"You know what I found?"
"I'll give you one last chance."
"You think I wanted this?"
"I do everything out of love for you."
"I think you should talk to him."
"Let me judge for myself."
"Where can I go?"
"What if there was someone?"
"Do you know what that means?"
"Do you know what that means?"
"I didn't do anything else."
"What comes out of the ground?"
"Yes, I guess you're right."
"I think we've waited long enough."
"I did it last week."
"Of course I want one."
"What else can you tell me?"
"Let's show them what we can do."
"I made them."
"I look forward to working with you."
"Do you see what I have to go through?"
"You have to get out of here."
"How could I not see anything?"
"You can ask anyone."
"She doesn't answer her phone."
"What happened to you, my boy?"
"You know very well that I love you."
"He came out of it cleansed of everything."
"Please trust me."
"I've read about it."
"That's what it seemed."
"He wants to know what's going on."
"Do you want a bullet in the head?"
"He will know what that means."
"I'm going to make some coffee."
"Have I not been clear enough?"
"I've dreamed about it all my life."
"I have some personal matters to attend to."
"Don't you wish me luck?"
"She needs to be taken to the hospital."
"I have to tell my mother."
"If you're reading this, you're out."
"I don't know, it's possible."
"I think I can handle this."
"No, but it won't be long."
"Okay. I'll be right there."
"I met him on the train."
"Are you listening to what I'm saying?"
"I'm trying to tell you something."
"Is this supposed to make me feel better?"
"It's been like this for years."
"That's what I'm for."
"I heard you on the radio."
"Do you know what we're doing here?"
"What does he say about it?"
"I made you."
"That's what I told him."
"Do you know what I realized?"
"Your family is united, I feel it."
"The perfect marriage between technology and management."
"What if we don't find it?"
"Not mine or the director's."
"I thought it was an accident."
"Please, it's important."
"Please, this is important."
"And even if it was?"
"I really want to see you."
"Inspector Ho, please."
"What do you want me to know about it?"
"They are exterminating us."
"I said I would."
"I never had a daughter."
"Do you tell him or do I do it?"
"I never thought it was possible."
"There must be some somewhere."
"We'll have to catch up on our fishing trips."
"You are your father's daughter."
"I should have told you about us."
"We do it in front of the United Nations."
"Would you like this to become a movie?"
"I thought we had that sorted."
"Tell the Registers to get lost."
"You never talked about her."
"It's nice of you to think of it."
"Three beers for each of my colleagues."
"Is that what happened to you?"
"He's a really good person."
"I am an FBI special agent."
"Did you do it?"
"I'd better go home."
"I did pretty well."
"You know what I said?"
"They already know we're here."
"I've told you a hundred times."
"I'll be here for a while."
"But what are you saying?"
"No, I didn't find it."
"Didn't anyone notice?"
"If that's how you feel."
"Let's go see your aunt's apartment."
"There is only one possibility."
"It's better that you don't know anything."
"You want it to end like this?"
"I think we're onto something."
"This is the first thing to do."
"After all, tomorrow is another day."
"Thank you for doing this for me."
"Do you want us to call someone?"
"There is no camera."
"Nothing good will come of it."
"Power beyond your dreams."
"Do you think you can do this?"
"You've come to the right place."
"How would I know?"
"Tell the driver to take my luggage away."
"Did I tell you to do it?"
"Who knows what that means?"
"Oh, she's my friend Caroline."
"What is it again?"
"It depends on how you look at it."
"I saw how you looked at each other."
"But Nicky and his gang had slipped up."
"I've never seen you before."
"You need the password."
"I know what happened to you."
"I thought it was mine."
"That's what it's called."
"But you have to tell me the truth."
"That's one way of looking at it."
"I'm not what you think."
"I look forward to completing your training."
"FBI We have a warrant."
"Maybe there is someone."
"Let's tune in to the highest energy."
"Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?"
"Don't you realize it?"
"What if she's not there?"
"All born one year apart."
"What are you doing here?"
"I have to earn a living."
"What happened to my apartment?"
"There is a man downstairs."
"That's what we thought."
"No, I'm not very hungry."
"How many times do I have to apologize?"
"Anyway, I have to go."
"Thank you for opening my eyes."
"Because it's rare, you understand?"
"If it is God's will."
"I know you have things to do."
"Place your bets, please."
"Sorry it took so long."
"I put it in a barrel."
"It's just a small gift."
"There must be other options."
"You should have said that earlier."
"I want you to come home with me."
"A rebel who gives himself up to us."
"We'll find them, you and I."
"I need a fresh start."
"I'll deal with him later."
"You can stay here if you want."
"You haven't changed at all."
"I can make phone calls."
"I've never seen you here."
"I suggest you do the same."
"So what have we gotten ourselves into?"
"I thought we were a team."
"I thought it was for me."
"What do you want, Dad?"
"It should be the same in life."
"We wish you a very happy birthday."
"He's trying to tell you something."
"Show me what you can do."
"I want you to take the Falcon."
"Do you think that's the case?"
"I guess that's the case."
"I'm going to go get myself a beer."
"Can I do anything?"
"I know what you're all thinking."
"This is what brings me here."
"I don't know that word."
"No stopover in the red zone."
"This is my father's funeral."
"But that's another story."
"For what I did to you."
"I don't ask myself the question."
"I told them where we were."
"And then there is something else."
"I wrote something for you."
"It's never been so good."
"You are the last of this line."
"It's me who should thank you."
"Yes, you already told me that."
"Have you seen my report card?"
"Roy, what are you doing?"
"Have your cake and eat it too."
"I've never seen one."
"Do you have any advice for me?"
"No woman is worth it."
"I'm glad we understand each other."
"The same as your father's."
"No, I'm not aware of that."
"I'm going to put out a wanted poster."
"I'm really glad to see you."
"I was a friend of your father."
"I think this is for you."
"We all put something into it."
"Is she safe?"
"I did it last time."
"Do you think it's the food?"
"I have all the time in the world."
"Sorry I wasn't there."
"Please don't hang up."
"It's day and night."
"It's about your son."
"Trust me, please."
"I didn't expect that."
"Something else happened."
"I am exactly where I want to be."
"And how do you plan to do it?"
"And how do you intend to go about it?"
"That's what we always do."
"I could see it in his eyes."
"I need a heating engineer."
"Do you think this will last long?"
"So, shall we go around, guys?"
"They only talk about you."
"But you should have been faster."
"You have the right to remain silent."
"Where did she go?"
"Do you care about me?"
"What are you looking for here?"
"Wait, what is this?"
"It's tap water."
"How many times should I say it?"
"Yes, what can I do for you?"
"You'd better check in my office."
"I'm glad to have met you."
"It's easy for you to say that."
"I'll be back in three days."
"I've never been asked."
"He has lifted the spirits of many."
"I'm bringing back Mr. Chow's books."
"I love spending time with you."
"I have one last thing to do."
"It's always about money."
"Who else is in on this?"
"Of course you want things."
"Oh, I forgot to tell you."
"I hope one day you will understand."
"I thought it was the right one."
"Yes, I even thought about writing one."
"I told you to hurry."
"I have to go to the hospital."
"He has the right to be there."
"She's not on the list."
"They shot him in the back."
"Do you want me to come back later?"
"Mom, where are we?"
"Maybe he won't come back."
"I said that."
"Ms. Chan, are you going out to buy noodles?"
"You know what I heard?"
"What makes you laugh?"
"The events in Monaco have proven this."
"Vegas was a dream come true for me."
"Where do they come from?"
"I am from the Music Hall union."
"Say something to Mom for me."
"This story is inspired by true events."
"It was my mother's house."
"You know what I thought?"
"Yes, I will do my best."
"What did you do to my baby?"
"What are you talking about?"
"You're no better than me."
"I took him to the hospital."
"Please open the door."
"There may be microphones."
"I'll get you out of here."
"Do you know something I don't?"
"Nobody talks to me like that."
"You don't have a girlfriend?"
"I've loved you since day one."
"Who came up with the idea for the calendar?"
"You say that to all the girls."
"Don't say things like that."
"What happened to your lip?"
"I received a phone call."
"She was impounded."
"Well, what do I do?"
"It's because I'm here."
"And I have to thank you for that."
"And what do you believe?"
"People come and go."
"It's about you and me."
"He taught me a lot of things."
"Where did you get Oklahoma-Michigan from?"
"Here is the warrant for the detainee's arrest."
"I know his name, I know him?"
"I need another service."
"Across the river."
"I thought it was important."
"Are you on your period right now?"
"Oh yeah, I've heard about it."
"I saw it in action."
"And I will always be there for you."
"How can I help you?"
"You can believe whatever you want."
"You're not a little boy anymore."
"Is this the reason for your visit?"
"You have something between your teeth."
"Does the Senator yield the floor?"
"He got what he deserved."
"I told you to go."
"Mom said it."
"I only need you."
"I've never been there."
"Do you know who you're dealing with?"
"She didn't want to say it."
"I need to know what you know."
"I'd better go talk to him."
"What did you do to my daughter?"
"Check with the FBI to see if he's on file."
"The last one standing is the winner."
"You seem to be doing fine."
"I will do what you tell me."
"Jon must see the world like that."
"What happened to my men?"
"This is my mother's room."
"You've been locked up here for two days."
"I don't even dare to think about it."
"Is that all you're saying?"
"No, there were others."
"You're the one who doesn't understand anything."
"They are practically out of the game."
"I had a vision of you."
"You will see a jump in a puddle,.."
"What did you bring?"
"I don't know her either."
"It's just love."
"You know what I mean?"
"I just arrived in town."
"And that's what you want?"
"Do you know how to use it?"
"It took a little while."
"I'm sure it's good."
"Would you do anything for me?"
"What will you do when you grow up?"
"It's a real gold mine."
"More than you can imagine."
"And here we go again."
"I thought you wanted to leave her?"
"I'm sure you'll make it."
"I use it all the time."
"They are getting younger and younger."
"This is how it should be."
"No, but I know where he is."
"I called her ex-wife."
"This return is surprising on his part."
"What did you decide?"
"For a pack of cigarettes per head."
"A lot of things can happen."
"Sign here for your valuables."
"That's what I had to say."
"Is that what you're asking me?"
"Did you see what it was?"
"Tell me what she did."
"That's what my mother says."
"This is how I love Helen."
"You don't need this anymore."
"What do you want to talk about?"
"I'll keep you safe."
"I see you're serving drinks."
"But we have to go."
"I used to play it when I was little."
"I had put him on the spot."
"The number of hotel employees."
"It's time to choose sides."
"They are beautiful, aren't they?"
"It's him, I'm sure of it."
"Mindy wanted two girls and a boy."
"Wouldn't he be safe here?"
"I'm sure you'll like it."
"An iced tea, please."
"Thank you for telling me your secret."
"This is exactly what I expect."
"Have you seen me on TV?"
"You know I don't drink."
"Looks like the post office is still working."
"What does that mean to you?"
"She gave her life for me."
"I only have half an hour."
"He had a fight with his wife."
"See you later, my love."
"I'll make it work."
"Who can shed some light on these inscriptions?"
"Your mother's maiden name?"
"I'll see what he's doing."
"I have something in my eye."
"I know what I have."
"Being locked up and finally accepting it."
"I'm delighted to finally meet you."
"That's what he said."
"I can see how you look at me."
"What happened in the meantime?"
"Go see elsewhere if I'm there."
"So what happened?"
"Do you think that's why?"
"What about this one?"
"I'm glad I found you."
"Is that a yes?"
"Can I see some ID?"
"So what do you want me to do?"
"I needed time to think."
"It was time we met."
"And what will you do?"
"I know what you need."
"Yes, I was lucky."
"I wanted to surprise you."
"I feel it deep inside me."
"We both were."
"You look very sexy tonight, baby."
"It's like I said."
"I told you to be careful."
"With a brother from another marriage."
"You didn't want me to come?"
"I wish everything was different."
"And what do you want me to do?"
"Glad you changed your mind."
"Do you think we can do this?"
"I thought you were gone."
"I'll give you an 'old buddy' discount."
"He would be about your age."
"But what does he say?"
"No, I have nothing to do with it."
"The study of pressures and time."
"This is the job of the police."
"Is this really what you want?"
"You saw what happened."
"But you have to promise me one thing."
"Can't you make an exception?"
"I thought it was better."
"You said some pretty brilliant things."
"I just want to ask you a question."
"Isn't that what we wanted?"
"This is what we all wish for."
"All you have to do is sign."
"I have always taken care of you."
"How many times have you done this?"
"I'm a bit of a magician at that."
"I took it just in case."
"There is always another way."
"No, you mean it's great."
"That gives us a little time."
"I do my job, do yours."
"She's gorgeous, isn't she?"
"The Force is strong in my family."
"We just agreed."
"And what would that be?"
"What is her maiden name?"
"I forgot I had it."
"I mistook you for a cop."
"Let's see who is hiding behind the mask."
"Is this the Department of Justice?"
"He talks about you all the time."
"You have always been by my side."
"I'll come back tomorrow, first thing in the morning."
"It's like we're married."
"It's time for me to introduce myself."
"It's time for you to go to bed."
"I thought we had an arrangement."
"How do you know about this?"
"I found someone else."
"She said it was important."
"Well, that's a good question."
"Do you really think that's it?"
"It's a little early for that."
"I saw you through the window."
"I want you to work for me."
"You disobeyed a direct order."
"Your own number, on your own door."
"Please drop your weapons."
"Your parents must be proud of you."
"I can't live with you anymore."
"Who should I call?"
"And then she played with him."
"He came to the stock this morning."
"We will do what I have decided."
"The curve of the Earth prevents this."
"I just want to, that's all."
"You better get out of here."
"What did you eat?"
"This is exactly what we want."
"So what are you waiting for?"
"She's lovely, isn't she?"
"Until the end of my days."
"You know I like Jasmine."
"Promise me one thing, both of you."
"Tell him what you saw."
"What happened to this woman?"
"You'll see what it does."
"Is this what I believe?"
"Did you stay up all night?"
"I have to get you out of here."
"What we should have already done."
"What's inside?"
"What is it, my son?"
"I really hope you are right."
"I don't have any others."
"There's plenty of it."
"I saw the face of God."
"Were you the first on the scene?"
"I thought you forgot about me."
"Is there another entrance?"
"It was my father's first name."
"Don't you feel the same way?"
"You have to get me out of here."
"I have a friend in the hospital."
"He may have changed his mind."
"I have a lot to say."
"What's new?"
"Do you want to be my bridesmaid?"
"Glad to see you're feeling better."
"But he's a good person."
"You didn't ask the question."
"When you're right, you're right."
"What are you singing to us?"
"Are you used to this job?"
"Do you know what they said?"
"I'm going to be late for class."
"He could screw everything up."
"They better do this right."
"He has some really good ones."
"You are the woman of my life."
"You want to know what I want?"
"I have what I need here."
"I came to ask you a question."
"I need a urine sample."
"This stuff sells itself."
"This is a big moment for me."
"It's not the same anymore."
"Especially when it comes to money."
"I'll see you later."
"We are all very proud of you."
"You know what we need?"
"That's it, I remember it."
"Do you think I made it all up?"
"I thought you wouldn't come back."
"We started together, we will end together."
"I've never been anywhere."
"Do you think we'll believe you?"
"I'm going to ask you some simple questions."
"I have a little job for you."
"In Memphis, talking to you."
"Have you met someone else?"
"I think we should go."
"This is the way out."
"I'm sure we'll see each other again."
"I think I have one."
"What don't you think?"
"Are you trying to tell me something?"
"It's just a memory now."
"You don't know what I'm talking about?"
"And that's what I will do."
"It's heaven that sent you."
"What is written there?"
"You have a knack for saving me."
"What if something happens to you?"
"By the way, what's your name?"
"But there is good news."
"We'll take care of the house."
"Do you think I don't see anything?"
"I know he's your friend."
"Is it because of a girl?"
"Is what they say true?"
"Is what they say true?"
"Of course, otherwise I wouldn't ask."
"That's very mature of you."
"It must be one of those."
"To them, everything seemed fine."
"See you in half an hour."
"I do what I want."
"What do I need?"
"Still can't sleep?"
"I think I have a plan."
"I know you wanted to deactivate me."
"You're going to be late for work."
"I hope it works out for you."
"No, it's not that simple."
"How could you hide this from me?"
"And what about you?"
"It will be the same for you."
"His book has no story."
"No, there is another one."
"What is he doing?"
"So what brings you here?"
"And look what happened."
"I've had long nights here."
"He must have already sent some guys."
"I know exactly what you're talking about."
"All right, I'll be right there."
"I thought you would be more enthusiastic."
"To me, he's mentally ill."
"It makes my blood run cold."
"I can and I will do it."
"I know times are tough."
"I didn't learn much."
"This is the first one I've done."
"I need some wire."
"You never told me anything."
"Who is the Spider photographer?"
"You don't need her."
"You know what I really want?"
"Until now you have been flawless."
"That's how we operate."
"That's a different story."
"You can take it if you want."
"Do I look like a bank?"
"Please come to Earth."
"Their number is increasing day by day."
"You asked me."
"What happened to your tooth?"
"That's what you always do."
"The scouts will lead us to the generator."
"There is water here."
"How long have you been doing this?"
"I need a big favor."
"What are we going to see?"
"Tanaka certainly has something in mind."
"Maybe you shouldn't."
"He said it was good."
"Joey, what are you doing?"
"Do you show him that you love him?"
"What else happened?"
"What is the secret that unites them?"
"See you next weekend."
"I never had a family."
"This is the one I want."
"Do you want to talk about it?"
"What have I become?"
"He took me under his wing."
"You said you'd be back soon."
"You don't say anything about your gifts."
"But I'll tell you something."
"That's what they tell me."
"You, give me a hand."
"I'm sure it will work out."
"You just have to do it."
"What do you think he's going to do?"
"Yes, that's what I thought."
"What do you want, Morgan?"
"I suspected you'd say that."
"Should I have sent him packing?"
"This is my dearest wish."
"The baby is kicking."
"I heard you on the radio."
"I love walking there in the evening."
"I'll call you back as soon as I can."
"We're all on the same team."
"I had never seen it before."
"But thank you for thinking of me."
"What did he tell you, exactly?"
"You have to tell me."
"You had an affair with her."
"If his feelings are sincere or not?"
"Yes, it looks like it."
"The L.A. police, the feds."
"It won't be much longer now."
"I do it from time to time."
"I gave him a sleeping pill."
"This is the key to the future."
"I think she likes you."
"You're the one who doesn't understand."
"No, I am."
"Do you have something to tell me?"
"My stomach is full of Xanax."
"The same goes for you."
"Do I have something on my face?"
"Do I have something on my face?"
"There must be a rational explanation."
"In his little Russian house, all blue."
"I'm at my best."
"Do you want to tell me where we're going?"
"This is modern art."
"You could have said it sooner."
"Honey, what's going on?"
"I always wanted to be a spy."
"You don't want to come with me?"
"They had other plans for me."
"But you never did."
"What do you have planned?"
"I was never told that."
"It has to go well."
"Who says you are one?"
"You have always been there for me."
"You pulled your own tooth out."
"You need to talk to him, Antonio."
"It's becoming more and more common."
"It had slipped my mind."
"The report of his quest for the Grail."
"Do you listen to me when I talk to you?"
"Take your courage to the girl, Spartacus."
"Oh, the pleasure is all mine."
"But what does that change?"
"Have you seen my service record?"
"You know what he's capable of."
"I'm not sure either."
"That's what we would like to know."
"That's what we would like to know."
"I have a sixth sense for that."
"Did you tell him?"
"I have to go now."
"We do what we want with it."
"We do what we want with it."
"I'm the first to say it."
"That's what scares me."
"I thought it was your mother."
"No Security Level worth it."
"We need more men."
"Time is slipping through our fingers."
"I said I'd think about it."
"For the first time in two months."
"I have to get ready for school."
"He has something to tell you."
"What's so different?"
"This is how it ends."
"You may have known him for a long time."
"Are you sure it's them?"
"You have other fish to fry."
"I'm married to a doctor now."
"It's just a small cut."
"What are you here to do?"
"Where did you get that one from?"
"Maybe the girl signed up?"
"I think we should do it."
"This is far from the case."
"Stu, how much do you have in the bank?"
"It sometimes takes three days for identification."
"I think you're right, Montana."
"You did this to yourself."
"What did she answer?"
"Where is it written?"
"I'll pay whatever you want."
"Are you sure it's him?"
"Are you sure it's him?"
"It was several years ago."
"I say we should hire him."
"She never said anything about it."
"This is the room for serious conversations."
"I wonder what they say."
"You didn't answer the phone."
"You'll be the first to know."
"And who does this check go to?"
"That's all that matters now."
"We are all from the same family."
"I'll go get her with you, Everett."
"Is there another man?"
"Please stay with me."
"I'll look for some transportation."
"Do you know what happened to you?"
"I thought it was the hunter."
"What will it do?"
"He had a wife and two children."
"Are you going to write that into your script?"
"You said it was important."
"I made you debut."
"Are you sure that's it?"
"Are you sure that's all?"
"You know I have it."
"I have another gift for you."
"I make and sell soap."
"That we should tell each other things."
"I want to hear it from you."
"You can't go now."
"Thanks buddy, this is for you."
"Colin saw it in his camera."
"I fought for this country."
"The priest leads them directly to the Temple."
"I just want to tell you something."
"But he never did."
"An hour for me or for you?"
"I wish things were different."
"It's you I want to see."
"We are in the middle of a war."
"No, I don't like that, thank you."
"They are in a safe in Spain."
"I need another favor."
"Who do you think you're dealing with?"
"One more gram and it will be great."
"Can you take me to this address?"
"Of course it is."
"If you need me, call."
"I need them both."
"Do you like seeing other people's cards?"
"It's because of the accident."
"Come see something very beautiful."
"Where are my father's guards?"
"Are you the one giving the medal?"
"Is there a mechanic in the room?"
"I'll get us out of here."
"With a package, a backpack?"
"I didn't ask for a lawyer."
"No, you don't have the right."
"You look like a lunatic."
"We must defend the traditions of freedom."
"Make sure they find them."
"It can mean many things."
"This seems to surprise you."
"I still have feelings for you."
"Is she the girl of your dreams?"
"And how are we going to do that?"
"I think he wants to marry me."
"That's what we tell ourselves."
"Can I see you in my office?"
"I've heard that one before."
"I saw the end of the world."
"But I will send you a nice gift."
"You want to know what I was doing?"
"Have you looked in the mirror?"
"Everyone is on edge."
"I have something you want."
"I read about him."
"I heard you were looking for me."
"It must be someone else."
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
"You want me to call the cops?"
"This is the opportunity of a lifetime."
"Do you mind if I sit down?"
"Are you able to answer our questions?"
"His Grail research journal."
"That must have been quite a battle."
"And that was a long time ago."
"Inside and out."
"They say it's the best."
"Try to make the most of it."
"Who knows if he's not getting sugar?"
"Do you know what they will do to us?"
"Do you know what he said?"
"How long has it been since you slept?"
"I'm glad you came."
"I'm glad you came."
"You can be whatever you want."
"There is something underneath."
"He's gorgeous, isn't he?"
"It could happen to anyone."
"My boss demands an expense report."
"And above all, a woman who loves you."
"There's nothing for me?"
"She doesn't agree."
"I hope you like it."
"Doug, it's just a car."
"No, I'll put you on something else."
"I did my best here."
"What I want is you."
"Others do it for you."
"Where will this lead us?"
"You had found paradise in America."
"The cup that gives eternal life."
"But you have to keep an open mind."
"This is what you did to him."
"I already have what I want."
"I didn't ask you that."
"Is that all you remember?"
"I made him a hero."
"Welcome back to the world of the living."
"Nice work, isn't it?"
"I don't know, that's how it is."
"It ends with you in tears."
"That's all they do."
"I'll call you as soon as I arrive."
"So what do you do for a living?"
"I know what that means."
"How did you get into the mask?"
"I think we're done here."
"It is a law of nature."
"What could I do?"
"Where are we going to live?"
"It was a carpenter's cut."
"There are a lot of reasons."
"Can I have a glass of water?"
"But you know what it is."
"What do you mean you don't know Benny Alvarez?"
"I only took one."
"Maybe you're right, you know?"
"She left because of me."
"You're the only one who knows."
"He tells everyone."
"You need it more than I do."
"He took a shower this morning."
"I know exactly how she feels."
"You are your father's son."
"Please follow us."
"And the insurance will probably reimburse me."
"Don't make a big deal out of it."
"Don't make a big deal out of it."
"You'd better stay here."
"You'd better stay here."
"Your presence is required at the podium."
"We began to see things differently."
"I saw some on TV."
"Haven't you done enough?"
"Haven't you done enough?"
"This job was made for you."
"Before it was part of a ritual."
"You have to come see this."
"After what just happened?"
"I'm sorry, but that's how it is."
"I always wanted to start a family."
"You will live to see those days reborn."
"Is this what you wanted Tony?"
"But yes, I say goodbye to you."
"I'm done with the witness."
"The answer to what you are looking for."
"She hasn't changed at all."
"That seems to be it."
"Take everything you need."
"I'll do your hair and makeup."
"I saw it on his face."
"This man needs a doctor."
"I've lived here my whole life."
"He turned white as a sheet."
"What did you discover?"
"I haven't eaten since yesterday."
"I have lived in many places."
"I spoke to you on the phone, didn't I?"
"There is a telephone over there."
"Do you really know what you're doing?"
"I have work to do tomorrow."
"There's only you."
"So let him take you home."
"I think they're leaving."
"Honey, I'm so proud of you."
"And I'll tell you something."
"I have to take this call."
"I can take you if you want."
"You must have had that idea in mind."
"You only care about yourself."
"Sonny was keen on my offer, right?"
"You're the one who's high, Tony."
"Thank you for coming so far."
"Do you see what that means?"
"I'm yours, you see, Tony?"
"What is the new system?"
"I take things as they come."
"I think you already know that."
"No one observed vital functions?"
"His fate turned against him."
"How do you want me to calm down?"
"I made a new friend."
"You were taken for a toad."
"I think we have something."
"I think I'll give up."
"Maybe it's fate."
"I want you to feel better."
"As if I wasn't there."
"What image does he have of himself?"
"I need to catch my breath."
"I want you to know something."
"Bring your old brother a beer."
"What does he imagine?"
"But you have to be honest with me."
"To wait to be able to speak."
"It's the best in town."
"You'll be sharing Beth's dressing room."
"Just tell me what you want."
"She's charming, isn't she?"
"I have a deal for you."
"Initiative comes to those who wait."
"You should cross your fingers elsewhere."
"Because I don't have any."
"How did it go there?"
"You'll see what I mean."
"There must be one."
"What Art and Dash saw."
"This is the woman I love."
"That's what we thought."
"The lead role is made for me."
"You're the one who needs it."
"The bathroom is upstairs."
"Do you have someone in your life?"
"Do you have someone in your life?"
"What do you give him?"
"I'll be back in a quarter of an hour."
"And what do you want to talk to him about?"
"This is all new to me."
"Who said I love you?"
"That's what he meant."
"I will give you money."
"What is it, Doctor?"
"I want you to come with us."
"We heard gunshots."
"How long did you stay there?"
"I'll get myself another drink."
"Do you want me to say something?"
"Maybe I should go."
"Do you want to go to prom with me?"
"I know another children's story."
"I told you not to come."
"It's like licking a battery."
"And you, are you lecturing me?"
"I never asked you for anything."
"He said to start without him."
"No, it's not."
"You're going to give me an example."
"I met him in a bar."
"Sorry about what happened to you."
"I think we're almost there."
"You were very clear about that."
"I have to get back to work."
"It's the leap of faith."
"How did it go for you?"
"You are far from home."
"I haven't heard anything since."
"Find him and you will find the Grail."
"I would do whatever you want."
"I invited her."
"It still belongs to him, are you sure?"
"Call me at lunchtime."
"It's about your mother."
"Can't you sit across the table?"
"Do you think I did it?"
"I didn't know who I was anymore."
"Did he give you money?"
"But that's not true anymore."
"I want to know how it happened."
"Everyone to battle stations."
"One for the road, and you're on your way home."
"The solution presents itself."
"Take a look at this."
"Are you on the soccer team?"
"Thanks for getting me out of there."
"I never really thought about it."
"I just wanted to make that clear."
"What about my dad's car?"
"You know it is."
"An incredible thing happened to me."
"Yes, that's what I wanted."
"Of course you can't."
"Well, enjoy your party, Your Majesty."
"How did you know where I was?"
"How could you do this to him?"
"It was a while ago."
"Did you have a visitor tonight?"
"Come on, I want to show you something."
"Hi, nice to meet you."
"I know, I have perfect pitch."
"Do you know what's going to happen to you?"
"After all we've done?"
"You tell me when, that's all."
"I don't think he hears."
"It will take as long as it takes."
"It's just a routine check."
"One km without tailing, that's won."
"What does that inspire in you?"
"It's been like this since this morning."
"My license plate says 'inspector'."
"Can we know what it is?"
"What if he doesn't survive?"
"Do I look like a thief?"
"Do you have an answer for that too?"
"Have you seen Bates's mother?"
"Yeah, that's what it sounds like."
"That's what happened."
"There is hope, yes."
"It's inside you."
"It sends shivers down my spine."
"I've never seen him do it."
"He's going to screw everything up."
"Where do you think you're going?"
"I've been looking for you all night."
"Do you know how to use this?"
"That's my wife's name."
"We'll get you to safety."
"For once, they're doing their job."
"It's up to you to sort this out."
"He would do anything for her."
"You just have to stay there."
"Can I get you something to drink?"
"An ace, when you've trained."
"Have you had several boyfriends before?"
"Did he close the front door?"
"What was he doing there?"
"And what can I do for you?"
"What are you going to do with all this?"
"I already have what I need."
"I want to be a good person."
"You are in charge of this City."
"I'm in the middle of something."
"The official photo, where do I take that?"
"You're hoping to have a stillborn baby."
"Thank you for dinner and the evening."
"She's not an ordinary girl."
"How good to see you."
"Maybe one of these days."
"You didn't call the police?"
"Lord, what are we doing?"
"So far, has she confessed?"
"Please straighten the backs of your seats."
"There are people there."
"What are you doing, Doc?"
"I learned this at school."
"Don't you want to be with me?"
"You better come get me."
"We had ten years of peace."
"You know I'm telling the truth."
"You left early in the morning."
"I know how to handle him."
"I had a brilliant idea."
"I was going to make him a big star."
"I have an appointment at the hairdresser's."
"But here, pride comes first."
"Nice to meet you both."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a historic moment."
"Do I know anything about diamonds?"
"Is there something going on between you?"
"Do you have a reason to be?"
"As soon as he licks your pussy."
"From then on, I knew."
"You know you can't."
"Let's see what else we have."
"It's just the way he is."
"I'll get you another drink."
"It's money well spent."
"If that's what you think."
"No, it's not your fault."
"When can we be on air?"
"We made you the best possible."
"I watched it all night."
"Norman told him about the girl."
"Don't get on my side."
"What do you want me to do now?"
"I think I did it."
"Sorry for what he said."
"How are things going at school?"
"You said that last time."
"Is there a place for me?"
"Japanese men don't do that."
"This is what you should do."
"What's going on, old man?"
"I was just trying to lighten the mood."
"The girl who lives there was lovely."
"I never saw them again."
"I just wanted her to be happy."
"Professor Jones needs space."
"What am I supposed to do with this?"
"Would you excuse me for a moment?"
"This is the reason for our presence."
"This is a good idea, do you think?"
"It was his idea, not mine."
"No, I'm not one."
"What do I have here?"
"I'm going to have to ask you some questions."
"Dad plays golf with this guy."
"Everyone has a hobby."
"You didn't say anything at all."
"But drugs are the future."
"I make the law."
"I thought it might be useful."
"I never trusted you."
"I will do everything I can."
"I have to go to the bathroom for a minute."
"I've been calling you all day."
"What do you see in them?"
"May I join you, Esteban?"
"Noah, what are you doing?"
"Are you with me or against me?"
"You're looking for a partner, right?"
"What did we forget?"
"Tell me what you want to do."
"You can see I'm busy."
"His reputation sticks to him."
"I will bring him to the Bahamas myself."
"I know what you're thinking."
"Can I be driven back to the airport?"
"You talked throughout the presentation."
"We know what we saw."
"Well, that's the end of the book."
"I will do what needs to be done."
"Are you allowed to be here?"
"It is sail and steam powered."
"You do what you're told."
"A bag instead of a belly."
"He is one of them."
"I don't think I can."
"The best thing that ever happened to me."
"Would you have preferred it to be me?"
"What did you do to your face?"
"I took this from her dress."
"I think it's for me."
"That's what we all do."
"He got along with everyone."
"I found this in his things."
"How do you know it's me?"
"How do you know it's me?"
"No, you don't need it."
"I am the hotel manager."
"I think we can do it."
"Is that the name of the city?"
"We look out for each other."
"There are a whole series of them."
"Do you want to spend the night there?"
"Do you believe the Grail really exists?"
"They think he is a prophet."
"One last measure and it's done."
"You said we were chosen."
"You can say it to my face."
"Is this how you thank me?"
"At night there were lights."
"It's good that you came."
"It looks like they fought."
"What had happened?"
"This is probably a good idea."
"Don't you think you're exaggerating?"
"I signed a confidentiality agreement."
"Please be nice, this is my first client."
"I just want a glass of water."
"There is no glass."
"It's worth a visit."
"Where could we go?"
"What happened after that?"
"Where is he taking us?"
"Is that the role?"
"He has certainly already found the Grail."
"I have other patients to see."
"I will stay as long as necessary."
"There are only our men."
"You can't even say it."
"What I ask of them is doable."
"I have answered all your questions."
"Where can we go?"
"I decided to trust you."
"It's good to hear that."
"They say the world will be wonderful."
"He's about my height."
"I'll make a deal between us."
"She's nice, isn't she?"
"How long have you known me?"
"That's what you should do."
"I give you what you want."
"Sit on the bench to wait."
"We'll do it with or without you."
"How does it feel to be back?"
"What have you done with your life?"
"She's been like this since you came back."
"Can't we change the subject?"
"You have to leave it to us."
"At least let him take a bath."
"Are you on the soccer team?"
"Do you know why she said that?"
"That's where they come from."
"Show me what you can do."
"I have an appointment with the dentist."
"A bit of a reflection of the real world."
"That's what parents do."
"I'm just changing tickets."
"I think it's better this way."
"I'm sorry about that."
"What happens then?"
"Do you want me to write it for you?"
"I want you to believe in me."
"According to the directory, it's here."
"Love shouldn't be secret."
"What happened to your foot?"
"Are you asking me?"
"You're the only one who knows her."
"She is in the waiting room."
"Can't read English?"
"I want to know who he's talking to."
"Take the mayor with his girlfriend."
"She said she was a cop."
"How long have you had it?"
"Come on, I have a surprise for you."
"That's what I believe too."
"Can we know what you are doing?"
"What was I thinking?"
"What does he think about all this?"
"I don't want her to leave."
"You have some nerve coming here."
"I have it in front of me."
"I guess that's a start."
"He would do it if he could."
"When I'm free, one weekend."
"I thought it was in the past."
"Do you know about the trial?"
"He's been seeing one for some time."
"Maybe it's time for a change."
"How did I not see it?"
"She is always on the edge of the abyss."
"Can Spider-Man come play with me?"
"We have to face reality."
"I was like you at your age."
"You must have had a nice childhood."
"I can see it on your face."
"So you know what it is."
"She didn't have to."
"What will he think?"
"I hope we can sort everything out."
"You hired him."
"His wallet and keys are inside."
"Just do what I tell you."
"I want you to leave here."
"Who do you think you are?"
"Tell me what he said."
"He leaves because he has to."
"He talks about you all the time."
"I need to take a shower."
"I don't need her anymore."
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"A sandwich, while you're at it."
"I'm not quite right anymore."
"Something is stirring in the east."
"Put this in the trunk and come back."
"What exactly does this treatment consist of?"
"You didn't even think about it?"
"How can you think such a thing?"
"We need to be able to reach him everywhere."
"You want to know how I know?"
"I'm talking about myself."
"There's enough for two."
"What did he find?"
"I really need to talk to you."
"There was a car in the driveway."
"I am my father's son."
"It was a few days ago."
"It's time for my shot."
"I hope we can remain friends."
"I hope we can remain friends."
"I just remembered."
"Who else is inside?"
"When the big moment comes, let me know."
"Let's say someone who collects them."
"I think they're going to kidnap her."
"Did I wake you up?"
"Marie packed Madame's luggage."
"That was a nice move, Your Majesty."
"I'll remember that next time."
"Where is the nearest hospital?"
"Give it to me, please."
"I hope everything works out."
"Once we fought and died together."
"During the day, it's good for sleeping."
"And what did he tell you?"
"Please come and sit down."
"Do you think this is the time?"
"What if it's not her?"
"You need people like me."
"She said she was fine."
"Look at the passion on this wall."
"I do whatever it takes."
"Of course, who do you take me for?"
"I must have read that somewhere."
"You've got a message."
"He's the one who writes the script."
"Of course, whatever you want."
"I emptied the rest of the bottle."
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"I only saw her once."
"We'd better go."
"And I think Doug was there."
"Items of great value, Your Highness."
"What kind of motivation do you need?"
"It all depends on what you want."
"Why do you always talk to me like that?"
"Oh, what are you doing?"
"Who brought them?"
"On a scale of one to ten."
"When they need you, yes."
"Have you talked to your parents about it?"
"Do you have any questions for me?"
"I know you, don't I?"
"We don't care about your series."
"We found this in his room."
"All for one and one for all."
"What is the next goal of the project?"
"I'll be with you in a second."
"I would do the same for you."
"I've always been honest with you."
"What's better?"
"That's what my father wanted."
"I need you to sign this."
"And that's what you do."
"This is what you have to find out."
"How did you know I was here?"
"This is one of my favorite movies."
"I saw him, with his suitcase."
"What do you want to happen to me?"
"She must be at the hotel, right?"
"That's why it works."
"You tell me that every time."
"I have a beautiful white lounge chair."
"Is this what's going on?"
"Do you get along well with your father?"
"I thought we were having fun."
"Who will play my role?"
"This is company policy."
"Where did you learn English, Tony?"
"Did you write it?"
"What should I write?"
"We'll meet back here in two hours."
"It's time we met."
"You're fine, I have to go."
"I'll get you to use them."
"Is it because I'm white?"
"What does he want?"
"Please go home."
"It's at the house's expense."
"And you, could you find some pants?"
"There's always an answer, Tony."
"You have the newspaper in your pocket."
"No, it really wasn't far off."
"She couldn't do it."
"Someone will take care of you."
"It's just us now."
"Are you ready to party?"
"All you have to do is give it to him."
"I look forward to working with you."
"You can expect five more."
"I'll tell you who I am."
"It feels like we're there."
"We have the number and address."
"It's a job like any other."
"Where did he learn negotiation?"
"There's one over there."
"Hundreds of lives are at stake."
"It's up to us to judge."
"That's very generous of him."
"Do you know who it is?"
"Do you know who it is?"
"He will blend into the crowd."
"This is the key, I know it."
"What's going on, boss?"
"You know what I was thinking?"
"Do you want me to call someone?"
"This is a big step for me."
"Of course, that's what I'm here for."
"Mr. Ho, haven't you had lunch?"
"Is what she says true?"
"She was the light of my life."
"I'll need you later."
"She can't marry a guy like that."
"I won't let that happen."
"Do you know what you remind me of?"
"Tell me what happened to him."
"Thank you for saving my life."
"I think I'll stay longer."
"She shouldn't have mentioned it."
"I suspected it was you."
"What do I know about it?"
"What do you conclude from this?"
"I'm going to a three-day seminar."
"If that's what you want."
"And that really pisses us off."
"One more trip should be enough."
"What have you done with my son?"
"You'll have a great story to tell."
"I wanted to see what you would do."
"Come with us, please."
"I see what you are doing."
"My name is Human Spider."
"Because tomorrow the sun will rise."
"You were right about the wedding ring too."
"Call me for the teeth type."
"We trusted you, and rightly so."
"I'm glad you called."
"What matters most?"
"But first, I want real proof."
"You do the best you can."
"I really want to go there."
"But you know what it is."
"He said he would think about it."
"I have to do what is right."
"Are you saying this to me in front of my son?"
"I thought I had left the National."
"What would you do with it?"
"Can you see us without the sheets?"
"I've had enough, that's all."
"You are the child who survived."
"Go ahead, I'll be right there."
"What do you think that means?"
"Do you let him talk to you like that?"
"It's just you and me now."
"I need it more than you do."
"And what do you see?"
"No, there are too many people."
"I usually do it."
"I'm going to Mexico with my wife."
"I saw the guest list."
"Maybe it's a secret love."
"It's the first door on the right."
"What are you talking about?"
"Do you want to know what's real?"
"She's been here for about six hours."
"You might need this."
"People are being murdered every day."
"I saw how he looked at you."
"We're going to do great things together."
"There is a very beautiful beach."
"He led us into a swamp."
"You have to do me a favor."
"Don't screw this up."
"For me too, it was wonderful."
"You didn't tell anyone?"
"I have a husband and a son."
"You are all I want."
"But it didn't happen."
"You got what you deserved."
"What happened to my wife?"
"I feel as big as a mountain."
"I know what they can do."
"And what does that change?"
"Raise your right hand, please."
"There may be an explanation."
"Was I right or was I right?"
"Marla needs a social worker."
"Don't ask where he got it."
"I don't need excuses."
"Did he tell you where he was going?"
"I have to tell you everything."
"I know you mean well."
"People only talk about that."
"You're not inviting me in?"
"How did this flower get here?"
"I like you, Donald, you know?"
"That's what I do."
"That's what I believed too."
"Have you told your parents?"
"A place for my friend and me?"
"You didn't tell him about it?"
"What does she think about it?"
"I have someone in my life."
"So what can I do for you?"
"Take what you want and leave."
"You took me in your arms."
"Exactly what I wanted."
"No, there won't be."
"What do you think is going on?"
"Grab your things, we're leaving."
"Pay attention to how you feel."
"But we can't do that."
"Or I make porridge out of it."
"Don't try to bend the spoon."
"I'll get you to safety."
"What happened to my daughter?"
"It already only existed halfway."
"What does that tell you?"
"What are they doing now?"
"This turkey is a little dry, isn't it?"
"I said I admired you."
"Is that all you want?"
"Dad saw you on the course."
"Is there anyone with him?"
"She had no choice."
"A lawyer may attend the interrogation."
"This is my father's house."
"I'll be back in two days."
"Here is the answer to all the riddles."
"Are you having a good evening at Babylon?"
"But you have to be a hero."
"I hope he pulls through."
"The house had become a living thing."
"Yes, that's what we thought."
"Better now that I've seen it."
"Sorry, I have to go."
"Of course I read it."
"You think I knew that Stu?"
"What have you achieved thanks to me?"
"I'm sure you understand me."
"What if she doesn't make it?"
"We'll see each other again in another life."
"You remember my son Samuel."
"Whatever you want, my love."
"I would be careful if I were you."
"It was so that he would love me."
"I hope this is the last one."
"You have to do the right thing."
"Do you know what he means?"
"Remember our last drink together."
"You are not paid to think."
"Do you know someone who would be interested?"
"He was so good to me."
"What did we miss?"
"What do you think I should do?"
"Show me your ID card."
"It's almost dinner time."
"Well, what do you want?"
"And I want to keep it that way."
"What do I get from you?"
"Is there no hope?"
"Take a look at this."
"I'll tell your father."
"No, what are you doing?"
"His compassion for you will be his downfall."
"You always took care of me."
"But finally, what is happening?"
"Maybe nothing is being done."
"This is where it ends."
"That's what I'm going to do."
"What, you don't trust me?"
"Have you ever shot someone?"
"That's right, you don't understand."
"No, I'll take care of it myself."
"He's my love, my whole life."
"In my office, please."
"I think it's time."
"Put your arms around my neck."
"Do you think I should go?"
"I wonder what they are doing."
"I said to go around."
"Do you know how many there are?"
"What are we doing?"
"That is very noble of you."
"Did the guy take a long time to come?"
"According to Diane and Eve, he loved her."
"I'm telling you what I know."
"So what is it about?"
"It's better that we separate."
"Let's go talk at my place, if you like."
"Are you particularly interested in music?"
"I worked with him in Tucson."
"How do you think I feel?"
"I should have told you the truth."
"Maybe you should talk to him."
"For you, it's in the bag."
"It's the only thing that works."
"You're the one calling the shots."
"You could set up a studio there."
"I wanted you to know."
"I have to earn a living."
"I know you don't understand."
"On a new one starting out, for example."
"That's when everything changed."
"I really wanted to see you."
"Afterwards, you will do what you want."
"You have written a lot about workers."
"What do I want to do?"
"I've heard so much about you."
"You keep saying it."
"You know what would make me happy?"
"You have to go through the service door."
"What, what are you saying?"
"I made it for my daughter."
"You seem to be doing better."
"I'll get you some ice."
"But more importantly, we have the plan."
"There are a lot of people here."
"I have to go, see you later."
"You come to me with a proposition."
"Is that what you meant?"
"I'm sure it's good."
"So what are we waiting for?"
"I saw how you look at her."
"This is an important moment for me."
"She told me a lot about you."
"But I want to face them with you."
"I told you this morning."
"Some of our men will come here."
"She is in my prayer group."
"But what are they making?"
"I was glad to see you."
"Do you want me to call the police?"
"Taste the life of a simple man."
"I feel like we're going to have fun."
"Have you done any research on me?"
"I'll show you where it is."
"What matters is the Grail."
"Remember our friend Doug?"
"Alright, what's going on?"
"You prefer women to money."
"I have to get ready for work."
"To make sure everything is okay."
"There's something I'm missing."
"I'm asking her."
"I'll take the same thing as him."
"I sent you an email."
"I heard about this guy."
"This is how we move forward."
"I had never had an accident."
"I need to make some calls."
"Shawn, what are you doing?"
"That's how you win."
"I took her to the hospital."
"And she was really nice to you."
"I'm going to have to ask you to step out."
"I'm the one who's leaving."
"I had everything I wanted."
"It is a pleasure to welcome you."
"There is nothing sexual."
"I think I like him."
"Are you the one who treated me?"
"I can take you back, if you want."
"Hey Superstar, it's Marty Super Agent."
"That's what I need."
"Sorry, we don't have any more space."
"I just came to say goodbye."
"Finally, we will make ourselves known to the Jedi."
"I want to see someone else."
"Let's hope He is on our side."
"I came to make a deal."
"I know what you must be thinking."
"But it is a matter of principle."
"He tears the skin off his fingers."
"Something is happening there."
"Everything is as I found it."
"What's in the box?"
"Where have you been these past few weeks?"
"Any idea who did this?"
"And what am I selling?"
"Tell me what happened to you."
"No, we can't say that."
"I know you have rehearsals."
"She's not family."
"Have you ever slept with a woman?"
"Other than that, not a word."
"We'll talk later."
"This is the only one we have."
"Bring Amy to Sasha's birthday."
"I've been looking for her all my life."
"I thought it was you."
"I have a lot of respect for you."
"What do you think would be a reasonable price?"
"But not on this matter, on you."
"It was nice to meet you."
"It was nice to meet you."
"What happened to the crew?"
"It comes from the embassy itself."
"Are you sure it's her?"
"How long did it take you?"
"I came to find my father."
"It's for your own good, my boy."
"Ships passing in the night."
"First, your family must release my sisters."
"I received a letter from him."
"How to speak a language without knowing it?"
"Because of who I am?"
"A secret badge for the secret service."
"It's important that you eat everything."
"You told me yourself."
"I have other things on my mind."
"I need the money tomorrow."
"I want you to tell me everything."
"I thought you didn't have any."
"How did you know I'd be there?"
"You know who that is, I imagine?"
"I have something for you too."
"Arrange it with my concierge first."
"They say they have two kilos to start with."
"I would like to talk to you about something."
"Why are you interested in this?"
"May I ask who you are?"
"I thought that was the point."
"When will I see you again?"
"I took you for a thief."
"I'll tell him you called."
"I see you're feeling better."
"What is he trying to tell us?"
"Something just happened."
"And how are things going for you?"
"Is the dark side stronger?"
"Is there food on board?"
"I have been with you for so long."
"Mick, you have heart like no one else."
"Don't you want to have some fun?"
"I put a lot of effort into it."
"I spent a lot of time there."
"What can happen to you?"
"See you later."
"We'll see you on the other side."
"Is there anyone left?"

"That's what you said."
"He took a child with him."
"What should he do?"
"On you and the Jew's wife."

"Maybe it's not the right time."
"And now he's the one getting divorced."
"Is the security device in place?"
"Is that all they want?"
"We have to go there."
"Maybe this is paradise?"
"That's what he wrote."
"I'll call you when I'm done."
"We need to call the police."
"He treated you like a royal visitor."
"Thank you for giving me this chance."
"What will happen to you?"
"He has other things on his mind."
"The President will be here in three hours."
"You're a long way from home, Captain."
"What if I wasn't?"
"There are twenty of us waiting for confirmation."
"Are you blaming this on me?"
"The Knight takes the Queen, you see?"
"They did this."
"Or prepare to reap the whirlwind."
"This is an interesting point of view."
"I want to do something good."
"I'll clear this all up."
"What was that?"
"It would give you the strength to act."
"Have you talked about it with your mother?"
"What if you don't?"
"First I would like more sheep."
"I don't think he speaks English."
"I hope we see each other again soon."
"I bought it last week."
"I need to take a walk."
"She is no longer of this world."
"Thank you for having me."
"I wanted to see you one last time."
"Men, that's what we are."
"They say that God has abandoned them."
"That's why I drink."
"Hey, do you want a glass of water?"
"They want you to speak more clearly."
"The Age of Men has ended."
"This offer is non-negotiable and final."
"I was just checking to see if everything was okay."
"It's his mother's funeral."
"No, it wasn't."
"A composer occupies the studio opposite."
"I was the one who suggested it to him."
"Is this God's world?"

"Show him what you can do."
"What else do you need?"
"There is only one Lawrence."
"You're going to have to accept it."
"It's time to relax."
"I have an appointment with the doctor."
"I had an affair with her."
"Is that how you talk?"
"I don't want ordinary men."
"Do we understand each other well?"
"You told me about intelligence."
"Is there a law against this?"
"I thought you would agree."
"I have respect for that kid."
"It's fine with me if it's fine with you."
"You can be proud of your son."
"I would do whatever you want."
"Please promise me."
"Where was I?"
"I thought we got along well."
"Tell me what's going on here."
"Maybe that's why I'm here."
"Matthew is a charming and intelligent boy."
"Stanley is not a good swimmer."
"Inside there is a famous wizard."
"I'll tell you what I want."
"After all, we're going to the morgue."
"I swear I don't know."
"It's better here than up there."
"I thought it was the other way around."
"Do you believe in the friendship of peoples?"
"I thought you'd never ask."
"What do you want to do for your birthday?"
"It must be some kind of record."
"No time to think about girls."
"Did she tell you to say that?"
"Because he's never there."
"He is with her."
"I know what he's going to say."
"He is in the bathroom."
"The father, God knows where he is."
"It was her, wasn't it?"
"We do what we are told."
"You are a goddess, a living legend."
"I'll make you a nice coffee."
"If that's what she wants."
"I think we're done."
"Everyone is inside."
"Does he have a name?"

"I only have one question."
"Probably the best thing to do."
"Are you sure it's God?"
"The device exploded underwater."
"Just a minute, please."
"You know the answer to this question."
"What did she know about it?"
"He is one of the kings of narcotics."
"How could you do this to us?"
"I have a few questions for you."
"I made my money with Jackson."
"I should have done this a long time ago."
"You did something good."
"I can also write you a check."
"Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served."

"I took a pregnancy test."
"I think it's a woman."
"He had bars on his window."
"This is the pardon of the Attorney General."
"Where are we?"
"Go see if the tractor is intact."
"The inspector told us all this."
"After all you've done?"
"But call the San Antonio office."
"Do you want to ask me any more questions?"
"No one else should know."
"You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
"I assure you it is true."
"You've never seen it work?"
"There is a reason for this."
"I have a Father in heaven."
"I need to make a phone call."
"I would have given my life for him."
"I never return to a market."
"One of my old roommates lives here."

"I'm glad I met you."
"You are in the middle of the road."
"Didn't she tell you anything about me?"
"What's in the briefcase?"
"It means something to me."
"You have a spot on your nose."
"I think this is my glass."
"It's about my son."
"The day your daughter gets married."
"I think you'll like this."
"At the end of the rainbow."
"I only saw him once."
"You all know what I want."
"And the old men make peace."
"It seems like you're enjoying it."
"I called when I arrived in Madrid."
"I think it's a boy."
"But how does he know about the treasure?"
"I want to see what it looks like."
"She's much prettier in reality."
"We have a long road ahead of us."
"There must be other ways."

"I don't remember very well."
"Terry over there takes care of the betting."
"We are surrounded by Russian submarines."
"And offer to take this off for me."
"Would you like us a cup of coffee?"
"I'm in the Army, actually."
"Can't they go back to the jungle?"
"Tell me about your time in the hospital."
"It's the best thing in the world."
"What did you say to the police?"
"I really want to give you a chance."
"No one will love you as much as I do."
"Can I get you something to drink?"
"Manhunt in the city."
"M.L.F., have you heard?"
"I found it in your bag."
"He shot him in the head."
"It's easier than you think."
"Would you like to show it to your agent?"
"Do you think it's that simple?"

"They say you were very well."
"He writes about war heroes."
"What am I doing here?"
"He looked into her eyes."
"Is anyone there?"
"One for you and one for me."
"But promise to keep it to yourself."
"You wouldn't happen to have a match, would you?"
"We have each other."
"We have so much in common."
"You will find it in the forward hold."
"I saw enough last night."
"I wonder where he went."
"I know I saw it."
"What do they want again?"
"Boris, we have all kinds of sandwiches."
"You're doing better than me."
"But it's not just that."
"It's her wedding day."
"Should arms sales be controlled?"
"I'll do it my way."
"It allows me to control these arms."

"Give me a reason to do it."
"Please tell me."
"I will do anything to make you happy."
"Do you want to know my name?"
"I believe in what I do."
"You must be ready for tomorrow."
"It's a bit windy."
"You are the one who betrayed me."
"I had an incredible night."
"I should have said this earlier."
"I'm still in working order."
"Isn't that reason enough?"
"I only thought of myself."
"There are many believers and curious people."
"If you have a family, leave it."
"That's exactly what I want."
"Do you want me to do it for you?"
"I want you to be yourself."
"No, you don't want to do that."
"I'm just taking a look."
"I think we can do it."
"All's well that ends well, right?"
"It's really nice to see you."
"I mean, what is this?"
"I've only known you for one night."
"I couldn't stop thinking about it."
"What does this have to do with anything?"
"You don't have a boyfriend?"
"I guess I should thank you."
"I tried to explain it to him."
"It's settled with this half portion."
"I'll tell you something, Mr."
"It's out of the question now."
"You had the green light to leave."
"What's really going on?"
"You'll never guess who's here."
"You have to arrive on time."
"I have something else to ask you."
"A word to one of you."
"What is he, then?"
"You're fine, that's the main thing."
"It seems to be very beautiful."
"She's here, isn't she?"
"It comes from the reactor wall."
"I just wanted to know who it was."
"And what am I?"
"This is where I belong."
"You make things come up in me."
"You have some nerve coming here."
"I brought you some clean clothes."
"As a last resort, target sensitive areas."
"You had to see it to believe it."
"It's been a long time."
"I have just turned a new page."
"And that's priceless."
"I look at him and he's about to leave."
"I think I know what it is."
"He recognized something in you."
"And it made me feel good."
"My mother is a very important woman."
"These are the last infantry reinforcements."
"What were you going to say?"
"I gave them a hand."
"We'll meet in half an hour."
"She was talking to me."
"I have to show you something."
"A life she cannot share."
"Did you learn that on your screen?"
"But here I ask your permission."
"You think so and you are right."
"Thanks for the tip, Brick Head."
"I think we have a winner."
"That's what we want to know."
"I had something in my eye."
"For old coffee, it's good."
"Do you know what he's going to do?"
"And what does he want?"
"They say they don't understand."
"Good news, we found your Mercedes."
"The whole world will pay to see this."
"A cream tone would give more light."
"It's good to see you here."
"I need to call my mother."
"Do you think he'll like it?"
"They got Sonny on the highway."
"I came as quickly as possible."
"A great opportunity presents itself to us."
"I won it in a bet."
"I didn't talk about you."
"What would we have done in his place?"
"Until we catch him."
"I want you to call the police."
"I'm the one leading the dance."
"Children, your room is on the right."
"I wanted to tell you earlier."
"Yeah, that's what I do."

"I was always there for him."
"The security code has been changed."
"The Cylons knew exactly where to find us."
"I think it's over there."
"I'll see you again at that university course."
"She gave me money."
"I saw your taxi park."
"Are you still going to school?"
"A contract that is, two years."
"I thought you should know."
"I don't have the courage anymore."
"I think I'll do it."
"Abraham Lincoln meets a Golden Family."
"But I need a favor."
"That's what I believe too."
"I will pay for them with my life, Judas."
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"There was only one guy."
"I almost pooped my pants."
"You have it in front of you."
"I'll take care of the paperwork."
"What does she say about it?"
"Can't you go get it?"
"What happened in this room?"
"But we are very different boxers."
"I have a sense of crowd."
"What compels my admiration?"
"He's coming back and we have to go."
"What if he doesn't show up?"
"I introduce this guy to some guys."
"We found it at the library."
"I guess I should thank you."
"You will do as you are told."
"I still have one thing to do."
"What does he think about all this?"
"I say the hare will be fucked."
"I know you said it."
"I never had a son."
"People called him through an intermediary."
"It's the same for me."
"Better late than never, I guess."
"What do you say to him?"
"Do you know what we need?"
"Don't you want to play with me?"
"She didn't say much."
"No, I haven't seen them."
"I was up all night."
"What happened to your family?"
"Do you know how this restaurant works?"
"That's what my friends say."
"Can I see your driver's license?"
"You can send me anywhere."
"Tell us what we want to know."
"My mother used it for sewing."
"But there is an important difference."
"No need, it's all there."
"You know what I was thinking?"
"You want to play hard to get with me?"
"There was something between us."
"Maybe we went too fast."
"Do you see the chest movements?"
"I think you did well."
"But what if he doesn't like Romania?"
"No, that's not an option."
"We don't care about his name."
"Jim, what are you doing?"
"I think it was Lars."
"Go to this comedian's son's house."
"But what if it had been more important?"
"I make the rules."
"Are you thinking of someone else?"
"This is a great moment for us."
"I must say universal peace."
"How did you know where to find me?"
"They'll fill your ears."
"I don't have time right now."
"It's time to give it back to you."
"He is harder than a nail."
"What are you going to do for your Talent?"
"You said it was over."
"That was three weeks ago."
"Do you know what that is?"
"I have answered enough questions."
"Maybe I should go."
"No one knows what he looks like."
"First choice, and first hand."
"As soon as he's here, call us."
"Not that you have tons of it."
"The channel wants a facelift."
"What do you think they're talking about?"
"Come back here, I want to talk to you again."
"They have never seen such artillery."
"I knew you would come for me."
"I could talk about it all night."
"Can we sit down and talk business?"
"No, I never have been."
"How is this good news?"
"What did you do with my kid?"
"I need to know now if it fits."
"Do you want him to talk or not?"
"They pursue the vanquished after the battle."
"It's such an emotion for her."
"No, I already told you."
"I have to tell you about it."
"And that's from me."
"I just wanted to see you."
"I'm glad you said that."
"I'm glad you said that."
"Are all these drawings yours, doctor?"
"And you, you who are in mourning."
"I suggested that she get married."
"Here is a good opportunity to do so."
"Who told you to say that?"
"I'll get you out of here."
"I think you could say that."
"Are you judging me by my size?"
"I'm killing myself trying to tell you this."
"Have you seen it?"
"No, he couldn't come."
"You will need their cooperation."
"One thing led to another."
"This place is getting on my nerves."
"You know what I'm telling you?"
"He'll be here in an hour."
"That's where we'll find him."
"I'm living it."
"What do we have?"
"I have to make some phone calls."
"What would you have done in my place?"
"This is the real American dream."
"Some more scotch for mom."
"You haven't changed either."
"I won't need this anymore."

"Take the helm, okay, buddy?"
"See you in the operating room."

"Will I be in contact with them?"
"Please let me finish."
"Do you want me to call a doctor?"
"A big prize offered by Air France."
"You need structure, discipline."
"Call it a friend, if you will."
"Let's see what we can do."
"What are you guys doing tonight?"
"I have another one for you."
"That's life, that's all."
"This one had a plum-colored dress."
"It's like a license to fly."
"Can't we resolve our differences?"
"No, I'm giving him something to think about."
"This is not just anything."
"What is your mother's name?"
"Do you want us to take care of it?"
"I'm glad you came."
"I came to tell you something."
"Everyone should have one."
"She has something in her throat."
"She would never have left her wedding ring."
"The Pittsburgh guys wanted guns."
"I thought it was the delivery man."
"Do you think I'll tell him?"
"We'll see what we can do."
"Are you going for a walk in the park?"
"I don't know anyone named Iris."
"You have the right to be happy."
"You've been talking about your wife forever."
"I had a great time tonight."
"We can come back tomorrow with my son."
"That was before I knew him."
"I don't think that will happen."
"It all depends on what you want."
"They didn't ask you?"
"Music is for everyone."
"Yeah, that's what I want."
"And me, do I count for nothing?"
"You forgot the Turkish military hospital."
"You should have taken better care of me."
"She should have been here hours ago."
"I want to do what you do."
"I hope he's not mean."
"Put them in the bag, will you?"
"Is that supposed to tell me something?"
"No need to go any further."
"They must have done something to us."
"I said I loved him."
"What will become of her?"
"There were many deaths."
"No, I wouldn't know what to do with it."
"He's at that table over there."
"You dare to speak to me in that tone?"
"Welcome, Jesus, I congratulate you."
"I need more space."
"And that's what you got."
"We emptied the shed and the lab."
"My Bigfoot photo was different."
"Do you like me?"
"In the style of the Military March."
"That thing I told you about."
"Do you want me to call the boss?"
"That's what I wrote."
"I've been waiting for this all day."
"Not if I see you first."
"I'll be back as soon as it's ready."
"Is that what you heard?"
"You want your story told."
"White wine, please."
"You talk about them and yourself."
"Is that what being discreet means to you?"
"He has something in his mouth."
"What will they say?"
"You can't drive like that."
"He got a weak tea yesterday."
"They decided everything."
"What do you think of Italian cuisine?"
"You have to stay out of this."
"You should know that."
"I hope you can understand."
"You have to know what you're doing."
"There may be no one there."
"He was the love of his life."
"This is my parents' house."
"I want to invite you to something."
"Tell him it's for me."
"I gained a little weight."
"We are doing a concert with the choir."
"Where did he go?"
"I knew you'd like it."
"After what he did to me?"
"I know you will."
"It's so good to see you again."
"An old friend who visits you."
"Do you know when you have to go to bed?"
"Yes, we don't see many Dwarf Women."
"That's basically what I am."
"How many cameras did you have on you?"
"Protecting these girls is my job."
"You will need two more types."
"I think they liked it."
"What do I say?"
"Where do I put them?"
"A psychology exercise, of sorts."
"Do you want me to tell you?"
"Have we met somewhere before?"
"Do you feel my hand on the back of your neck?"
"You know what I read?"
"I have other sources of income."
"Does anyone speak English?"
"I think he passed out."
"Do you know what happened to him?"
"I'll call you as soon as I know."
"This is my favorite picture of you."
"Everyone has been so kind."
"Are you blind?"
"I wonder where he can be."
"Please let me through."
"Who cares anyway?"
"You must give me strength."
"That's where the heart is."
"I kept it as best I could."
"Do you think it's smart to skip school?"
"No, you never did anything."
"And his daughter, as a means of pressure?"
"What did you order?"
"Is it normal for him to do this?"
"I have rights over this man."
"Do you think it's a homicide?"
"It seems he likes guns."
"Mom will take you home."
"I think the same about you."
"That's very nice of you."
"I need you there."
"That's why tomorrow it will be moved elsewhere."
"Okay if you eat a little."
"That's what they always say."
"What does she want again?"
"I want to take her home."
"I'm glad to see you too."
"Moe Greene is going to sell us his shares."
"He wants the Ring, that's all."
"You can tell me your name."
"Did she say where she was going?"
"I know what's at stake."
"People are who they are."
"I love you and will see you soon."
"We protect others to protect ourselves."
"That's what mothers do."
"I think this is the last one."
"I know you're in there."
"This city is full of good memories."
"I said I love you."
"How long did I look for her?"
"Tell me what you want to do."
"Would you excuse me for a moment?"
"I called you on your cell phone."
"Just outside the city."
"Traces of life were captured."
"You're like a brother to me."
"Is that your picture in the newspaper?"
"Glad you realize that."
"That's what we need."
"She has her whole life ahead of her."
"Do you want me to take you there?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Lola put me on the straw."
"It's true that he is cute."
"Tony, what are you doing?"
"This is one of my favorite songs."
"No, it's not a simulation."

"It's time to say goodbye."
"You know he was a Jedi."
"I have to go up to the office."
"And this one is still with us."
"It's a crucial business evening."
"He's one of your colleagues."
"For safety reasons, the hotel must be evacuated."
"As long as we get our share."
"What are you hungry and thirsty for?"
"I was going to tell you tonight."
"Do you know who is behind all this?"
"She didn't open her mouth."
"I'll have to talk to him."
"What do you think we should do?"
"Tell me you have a plan."
"Tell me you have a plan."
"I have something on the go."
"It's been like this for an hour."
"I need to get out of here."
"It looks like you're selling toothpaste."
"That's why they come."
"She's an old friend of mine."
"We will settle the score with this family."
"I haven't decided yet."
"Few people knew where they were."
"I need your full attention."
"I have something in my eye."
"Look what the cat brought back."
"Come with me to the house."
"He's fine, you see, normal."
"Isn't life wonderful?"
"You're not normal, she's right."
"No, it's while playing basketball."
"That's what they're going to do."
"It will never be the same again."
"And you know what I think?"
"You look like you're having fun."
"Do you have any advice for me?"
"What happened to you last night?"
"I would have told them who I am."
"Or rather, you ask their permission."
"Yes, half an hour ago."
"There's the Eiffel Tower there."
"Love is sweet as honey."
"You have nothing to say to him?"
"You didn't say a word."
"But I've never played it."
"I think I made myself clear."
"Do you want to know who my God is?"
"I know where I saw you."
"The inmates are ready for inspection."
"But I think I love you."

"You could have told me the truth."
"I'll be back before dark."
"Come give your dad a hug."
"She wanted it."
"Do you know all the girls here?"
"I wish I had more time."
"You will find it hanging from a nail."
"I hope it works out."
"Do you still have faith, Father?"
"It's better for both of us."
"What do you want to be called?"
"Is this life yours?"
"Because you are my best friend."
"I told you to watch her."
"I had to go."
"Do you think we'll believe you?"
"I wanted to see you again."
"Like you did for me."
"Do you think we have a chance?"
"Anyway, I drink more of it."
"I will give everything I have."
"Shine the parquet floor with pads."
"What was he talking about?"
"She called half of Barcelona."
"Do I look like a caterer?"
"You give me goosebumps."
"Are you going to tell me?"
"It was a pleasure to meet you."
"But I wanted you to know."
"That was months ago."
"Don't you want me to come with you?"
"If you know, tell me."
"This one sticks to your stomach."
"I found this in your pocket."
"Ask them if they want a drink."
"I have a daughter the same age."
"I was thinking about it."
"Is that why you're leaving?"
"We did it."
"Let Sol and I play this."
"What can I get you to drink?"
"You've known her all her life."
"I don't have the strength anymore."
"It was nice to see you again."
"I'll call him on his cell phone."
"I didn't think I'd kiss a snake."
"I don't need the details."
"Can you do that?"
"Go get some dry land, old man."
"Come in, this is your moment to shine."
"I used a new conditioner."
"I will make a pact with you."
"We take life as it comes."
"This is what Europeans want."
"She told me herself."
"I'm trying to cheer you up."
"It's just that you're not listening."
"He's like that before a match."
"I came home late."
"I've been waiting for you all these years."
"She thought we were having an affair."
"It's inside me."
"Except he isn't."
"I told him about these things."
"I heard you the first time."
"I had three weeks of training."
"Do you really mean what you say?"
"You look healthy."
"What do you think that means?"
"Looks like the party is over."
"Do you mind if I sit down?"
"No, I have nothing to say."
"The Citizen acted here first."
"Did you tell him?"
"Yes, you are absolutely right."
"I'm glad to be back."
"Give me a little more time."
"I want you to work for me."
"But what's happening to him?"
"I'm so glad to see you again."
"What did we miss?"
"I told you he would come."
"I think we can do better."
"Hold this for me, please."
"But we caught him in time."
"You know what it is, right?"
"I often pass by, and I see you."
"What do you want, huh?"
"I bought it for my father."
"Aren't we in the Matrix?"
"They made a record here recently."
"I forgot to ask his name."
"I can tell you where he is."
"It's beyond my skills."
"No, we need to talk about it."
"So go ahead and let us think."
"Where are you coming from at this hour?"
"Let's see what we have here."
"Maybe now is the time."
"How long did you live there?"
"Do you work for the railways?"
"You tell me, right?"
"Can you take me home?"
"You have a wife and children."
"That's what the legend says."
"No one can hold a candle to him."
"They're always ahead in California."
"I saw her last week."
"What happened to this place?"
"How is the honeymoon going?"
"He's probably a good person."
"I thought it would never happen."
"No one will know it's you."
"It really is the end of the world."
"What kind of guy are you, huh?"
"We put whatever we want in it."
"Are you sure it was him?"
"I am at peace with myself."
"Maybe that's why."
"Just a year ago."
"Yes, what do you want?"
"I was talking to him."
"I am with you all the way."
"I told my wife."
"What's for dinner?"
"What's making that noise?"
"This is exactly what we do."
"That's exactly what we do."
"Because I knew what she was singing."
"Recently surrendered to the CIA."
"She knew what was going to happen."
"It's a young girl's name."
"Not one of your mercenary boyfriends."
"You, what do you want?"
"You're my brother, act like it."
"I know I can do it."
"What is she going to say?"
"What were they doing here?"
"Is this our friend's fiancée?"
"He is the one who makes the law."
"I'll get the hors d'oeuvres."
"I don't have confidence in myself."
"You better get used to it."
"Who do you want me to talk about?"
"Yes, that's what I was saying."
"But let me tell you one thing."
"It's my mother's first name."
"Instead, what did he say?"
"Are you sure you want this?"
"I spent time with him."
"I just wanted to say goodbye."
"Whatever it may cost you."
"They are only found in Asia."
"He may have photographed the attacker."
"You chose it."
"I have two things to tell you."
"Is that all you care about?"
"He told me to come here."
"Do you have anything else to tell me?"
"Do you think he's in there?"
"We're going to be here for a while."
"I want you to see something."
"I'm glad I saw you."
"You'll see what I'm capable of."
"Who else lives in this house?"
"Do you know who it is?"
"He's making a ton of money."
"Not in front of Sugar Ray, right, Mick?"
"What's keeping you here?"
"I love you more than myself."
"We treat you the way you treat us."
"It's just between you and me."
"But how am I going to pay for all this?"
"You just have to remember that."
"That you do something for me."
"Where are my wife and son?"
"Did you hear me?"
"This is what you need."
"I hope you are feeling better."
"Remember that guy in Texas?"
"Were you there when it happened?"
"Were you there when it happened?"
"Tell me if you see anything."
"That's what I mean."
"That's your name, right?"
"You mean she'll be there?"
"I'll go with you if you want."
"We need to take him to the infirmary."
"I love doing plant mutation."
"Thank you for what you have done."
"He thinks you're the best."
"What don't you want anymore?"
"You'll see, it will be better tomorrow morning."
"I had never seen the ocean."
"I haven't heard from him."
"And before, was this your home?"
"I have something to do first."
"And you did yours."
"I read that in a book."
"Tell them what they want to hear."
"What would you like to do?"
"Did you see that?"
"I can show you how it works."
"They would have sent someone else."
"Many are near, praise the Lord."
"I'm above all that."
"But you didn't."
"Did I talk to you last time?"
"All right, I'll be right back."
"What exactly do you do?"
"I just need to talk to him."
"I wonder where they are."
"I thought I was the only one."
"What is your talent?"
"He was going to screw everything up."
"I'll tell you where it leads."
"Your feelings betrayed her too."
"Listen to what he has to say."
"I make love, not war."
"I'll take us all the way."
"We live in a very real world."
"What is there to think about?"
"Put Captain Solo in the hold."
"So we have something in common."
"I tell you it's him."
"You are the only one who understands me."
"You know what I want?"
"I put it in a box."
"Tell him it's our baby."
"I'm the one who arranged everything."
"You are my eyes and ears."
"We'll take care of the rest later."
"It's my sister's birthday."
"May you find your friend Spider-Man."
"Even a dog has more luck."
"Or is there something else?"
"I see what this is about."
"Thousands of years ago."
"This is the goal of the operation."
"It's better they don't come."
"I'm waiting for a boyfriend, that's all."
"I got a good price for it."
"It's nice of you to remind me."
"I didn't ask for this marriage."
"For that, you have to work for yourself."
"She's all I have left."
"Friends who don't even write?"
"My father did his best."
"I make sure everything is okay."
"Can I stay with a reduced team?"
"Is that what he was thinking?"
"Sir, what are you doing?"
"I always ran away from these situations."
"This is Madeleine in a different light."
"I've been wanting to tell you this for a long time."
"I'm still dreaming."
"You can think whatever you want."
"It was old age attacking youth."
"I did it for my son."
"Can you give me a tour now?"
"No need for miracles for the Messiah."
"He has a lot on his mind."
"And I have a lot of things in it."
"Who told you where I was?"
"It reminds us how beautiful the world is."
"He says that to everyone."
"I wonder what it was."
"God rest his soul."
"Here, we pay everything at once."
"It's bigger than I thought."
"What the hell are you doing, Tony?"
"Go to the police station for your statement."
"I want you to be my witness."
"Any idea where he went?"
"This is my dearest wish."
"I was thinking about my phone number."
"Close your eyes and open your mouth."
"It looks like that is the case."
"Think carefully about what you do."
"I could tell you some great stories."
"I choose not to."
"Well, what's going on?"
"Do you have a boyfriend?"
"I'll tell you who I am."
"This is how the Savior comes."
"Red sky in the morning alerts the sailor."
"He's a former CIA man."
"Close your eyes and wet your lips."
"She's Red Dog, and this is Beaver."
"Let her see who her uncle is."
"I see what I want."
"It's true that she is pretty."
"As long as we treat them like adults."
"No, that's not the question."
"Are he and his wife going to divorce?"
"What does that mean exactly?"
"It's the shots from last night."
"You have a mother, remember?"
"I saw you on TV."
"I wanted to spend time with you."
"They will be our army."
"Our army, our economy must be strong."
"You understand that, don't you?"
"How long has he been here?"
"Someone must know something."
"How long has it been since you slept?"
"Where did you learn to do that?"
"No, I can't tonight."
"I see her every two weeks."
"His family are all snitches."
"Are you telling me it's you?"
"It's time for things to change."
"He's with a great girl, Alabama."
"I have nothing else left."
"Everyone needs love."
"I really wanted to see them."
"Your father was very proud of you."
"Are you going to tell him?"
"This is what it looks like."
"Hey, this is what's going to happen."
"I think it's for me."
"What is the reason for your visit?"
"I had a lot of fun with you."
"The friend I told you about."
"I am crazy with admiration for you."
"Don't thank me all at once."
"Can we have a coffee in there?"
"He asked for a girl for you."
"You've done a lot of things together."
"Luckily there is this plant."
"What was he going to do?"
"No, the tone is not there."
"What do you think I did?"
"I wondered the same thing."
"He must have gone to the right."
"I'll come say goodnight to you later."
"Do you really want me to go?"
"I'm doing you a favor, my friend."
"Have you ever been shot?"
"What am I going to say to him?"
"You have to see the big picture."
"His crosses were better than his speeches."
"That was all I had."
"Judas, the Master speaks to you, answer him."
"I'll make short work of it."
"You owe it to yourself."
"Listen, I'm going to tell you something."
"Give them tokens, on my account."
"We take our things and leave."
"You call that being cool?"
"According to my mother, it's all him."
"I have what he needs."
"What do you do to them?"
"I won't give you that pleasure."
"You just have to tell him."
"At least you'd be away from here."
"Say something, please."
"You're going to be late for class."
"This is how I survive."
"What do you want to hear?"
"Do you think you're so good?"
"You heard, his name is Tyler."
"The real driver is floating in a sewer."
"People think I never go out."
"I have a beautiful and wonderful wife."
"You know what I found?"
"You know what's at stake."
"I wanted to talk to you about something."
"Do it, if you're so smart."
"That's all you're good for."
"This is a good place to start."
"I love you and I miss you."
"Do you understand what this means?"
"You know, it's practically my team."
"Let's stay here, among ourselves, in privacy."
"Did you find what you wanted?"
"When do I see you?"
"She proves that the story is true."
"I think she likes him."
"What did he make you do?"
"I thought we talked about it."
"Because I don't want to."
"I wonder what's happening to him."
"I bought it for my wife."
"It's your turn to shine."
"Did you find anything useful?"
"Don't say another word."
"You know why I have to face him."
"What exactly do you want?"
"It's going to take a while."
"I'm glad you came."
"If you have sheep, give them away."
"Do you want me to go with you?"
"I will stay with you all night."
"I thought you might like this."
"I'm only happy like that."
"On the way out, we'll buy two more."
"I saw her last night."
"And you will be able to defeat the king."
"Do you think I wanted this?"
"That's what I pray for."
"You have never been to Singapore."
"Should we prepare for their launch, General?"
"Oh, I see what it is."
"What is your husband's first name?"
"I thought I was doing God's will."
"Thank you for your time."
"I'll tell you anyway."
"I'll take that as a compliment."
"I think you know that."
"Since we've known each other for so long."
"It depends on your point of view."
"I would have liked to be born the daughter of a samurai."
"Have you ever seen anything like this?"
"That was very kind of him."
"They did it."
"I have to tell someone."
"Imagine that this line represents time."
"Welcome to your first flight lesson."
"Who would want to live in a place like this?"
"I know this because Tyler knows this."
"The peasants are the real winners."
"The way he looks at you, or not."
"Just looking at her exhausts me."
"There's a word on the TV."
"You have turned the city against him."
"Do you think I can do it?"
"The hardest part is the looks."
"He finds himself covered in black ink."
"They are heading towards another point."
"Electricity within everyone's reach."
"I completely agree with you."
"It was a pleasure talking to you."
"It's two hours from here."
"I gave it to you."
"Forced marriages are sometimes the best."
"You'll need it more than I will."
"And what an honor to get this far."
"You are doing it."
"What does it have to do with it?"
"Do you have any idea of its purpose?"
"Was there anyone who mattered?"
"No, I'm reading."
"I asked for a high-class chili."
"One of them opens this door."
"You have a way with words."
"How did you get here?"
"This is what it will do to him."
"Anywhere, as fast as possible."
"I know what she did."
"I think he already knows that."
"You brown it, without it sticking."
"What the hell are you doing, Solomon?"
"I can, but not that close."
"I want to see the place as I pass by."
"Of course we have the right."
"What could he do?"
"Do I have time to change?"
"What do you know about him?"
"I needed to hear your voice."
"I better get to class."
"I'm so happy to see you again."
"That was five months ago."
"Do you want a piece of my pie?"
"You're going to like this tiger, man."
"I saw it in his eyes."
"We have all night ahead of us."
"We have a question for you."
"Is that all you care about?"
"The fresh air does me good."
"What the hell are you doing?"
"I am so happy to meet you."
"He is a man like any other."
"The one you didn't want to open the door to?"
"Everything is possible thanks to technology."
"I'm at the end of my rope."
"He knew everything about everyone."
"No one will change your mind."
"What is the point of all this?"
"And I have Mr. Shadow on the line."
"I am a friend of Bobby Singer."
"No, he is not in a condition."
"How did you learn to do that?"
"Look what's happening to your friend."
"It's about your father."
"It's about your father."
"You're the one who parked it."
"I'm going to my office to get ready."
"Are these the only ones you see?"
"What do you think of my little philosophy?"
"You are the geisha of my life."
"What if I don't have one?"
"I came to tell you something."
"That he's some kind of vampire?"
"A lot of things happened."
"You just have to come and see."
"So you are the king of the Jews?"
"We need each other."
"I told you she would stay."
"That's why I wanted to talk to you."
"What do you have to say about that?"
"What are we going to do to my teeth?"
"What did we do last night?"
"But everything is back to normal."
"I live around the corner."
"You have something on your cheek."
"It is against God's will."
"That's what I had to do."
"I was talking to you."
"No, you didn't say it."
"Is it a yes or a no?"
"You know that Arabs are barbarians."
"It's a man's life."
"Do you think I did that?"
"Come on, I need to talk to you."
"I've never heard of it."
"Commander Lawrence will campaign this winter."
"Come back with me, please."
"Let's do what we do best."
"They seem to be heading towards the morgue."
"She knows exactly where the stones are."
"She didn't do anything at all."
"Because I've already done it."
"I'm sure that's it."
"What are you talking about, man?"
"Give me the keys to my car."
"What did you bring?"
"I would have told them where you are."
"You risked your life for me."
"I've always wondered that."
"It's about robbing a bookmaker."
"Lots of people here can do it."
"I like the way this is going."
"Kathy is feeling a bit pissed off right now."
"Can we do this?"
"You must have heard about me."
"Haven't we met before?"
"The Don is proud of you too."
"There is always room."
"Four samurai to guard each side."
"I'm paid to enforce it."
"I might have a better idea."
"But it's worth a try."
"For me, it's the most beautiful."
"What if she doesn't love me?"
"I need a ride."
"No one born of woman will reach Macbeth."
"She may have changed her mind."
"I want it done right."
"Don't you know who I am?"
"I am interested in other subjects."
"I'll tell you everything when I get back."
"You and your wife will be fine there."
"What if there is nothing?"
"He's the love of his life."
"I'm just keeping the king's peace."
"I did my part of the bargain."
"How about we have a little fun?"
"Do you understand what I'm doing here?"
"What are you going to do with this money?"
"When did she tell you that?"
"There is something between them."
"You'd better remember that."
"Was there a wedding here?"
"I think we should listen to him."
"I forgot what it was."
"Haven't we met before?"
"I think you know the answer."
"My father entrusted her to Doug."
"It's time to clean up."
"In summer, we even work at night."
"My colleagues and I are very excited."
"Do you ever dress like a woman?"
"This is all so new to me."
"There are plenty of other jobs."
"Well, that explains a lot."
"I'm leaving town for a few days."
"They think they won't come anymore."
"Why do you make me do this to you?"
"I put a simple sleeping pill in it."
"There were some good times."
"Have you studied the building plan?"
"Maybe you should go."
"You have a body, like everyone else."
"Do you think I'll go?"
"This is a portrait of James Monroe."
"This is a present for my son."
"Give me a chance to prove it."
"How long are you going to do this?"
"Later, people will say that about us."
"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror?"
"Look what's happening to your son."
"It's his word against yours."
"It's his word against yours."
"Do you have change for five cents?"
"Two of his teeth are dad's."
"I've been looking for you all day."
"No, I know no one by that name."
"Where was he last seen?"
"This meeting will have been a good thing."
"What are you doing here?"
"You let me take care of that."
"I think you should do it."
"They reached the air shield."
"Who asked you to do this?"
"Answer the door and be polite."
"It ties you to your old life."
"That's what I tell him again."
"Where did they go?"
"But that was just the beginning."
"You will hear from my lawyer."
"No, this is not my house."
"Are you sure you're not coming?"
"I would give everything I have."
"Good God, what's going on?"
"I had to go to the hospital."
"How do you put yourself in these situations?"
"No, I don't have children."
"Do you think you can do this?"
"I think of you every day."
"Do you have the keys to the apartment?"
"I guess I'll tell you."
"Tell him to call me urgently."
"I thought it was the right one."
"That's exactly what I'm saying."
"I had to get out of there."
"Did you talk to his father too?"
"You will give the name of the first composer."
"I thought it was a game."
"We're going to have a good time."
"As soon as I get back to base."
"People will think we love each other."
"You didn't expect that?"
"Who knows what that means?"
"I wanted to talk to you about something else."
"A bit like you with women."
"I have exactly what I need."
"I am an American, a refugee in Sicily."
"It's a big day for you."
"I have the right to defend myself."
"Let me talk to this guy."
"The second part, I agree."
"I understand why you did it."
"Is this yours?"
"How do I know you're cops?"
"You know what I heard?"
"I don't think we know each other."
"Thanks for letting me know."
"What do you do with your Arab friends?"
"I grow it in my window."
"That's the word you're looking for."
"When needed, he is fast."
"What happened to your eyes?"
"Tell him I need to talk to him."
"When will I see you again?"
"I settle the family accounts."
"The director is waiting for you in his office."
"Safe shots, clear background."
"I'll give you money to leave."
"It will take an hour."
"She's the boss's wife, see?"
"I didn't take part in it."
"I have to go to the bookmaker."
"When did he tell you that?"
"Imagine that I suspected it."
"No, I didn't go."
"Listen, I know how you feel."
"Is it still far away, at the Russian?"
"No, I'm telling you what it is."
"They've been in there since last night."
"Are you sure you can stabilize the fusion?"
"I have an appointment with my editor."
"Do you like the effect it has?"
"What world do you live in, what world?"
"What's stopping me?"
"We have three big days ahead of us."
"Give it to someone else."
"No, I'm not finished yet."
"I'll show you how it's done."
"I think he's a cop."
"You've always been straight with me."
"Not a king like you, lord."
"It's good to have friends."
"That's where the stars go."
"We'll see about finances later."
"By the way, who were you dancing with?"
"He wants to train you for command."
"Tell me what he said."
"I'll take care of your figure."
"Among ourselves, we called each other 'friends'."
"The governor will see you at his leisure."
"And those night outs with the suitcase?"
"You are a god among insects."
"These kids are here for a while."
"It's about your son."
"Or declare all-out war on them?"
"I would do it if I knew him."
"I read something about it."
"I brought you some soup."
"Imagine what power we would have together."
"I would like to know what that means."
"Do we have a plan?"
"You know what I saw?"
"She kicked me out."
"I thought you weren't coming."
"I'll call you when I'm done."
"Your father also flouted the rules."
"How will he do it?"
"What can I do?"
"I want to be in your arms too."
"We didn't give him any publicity."
"I asked him to come with me."
"Is this your first time in Japan?"
"You must return to the child."
"I wanted to see you one last time."
"The noise might attract someone."
"Now we will return to Black Rock."
"Can't you read my mind?"
"He came here to have fun."
"We will do everything we can."
"You can go if you want."
"You only live once."
"I want her to stay with me."
"Did you take him for a rabbit?"
"And I want you to be happy."
"The little one behind you is Mouse."
"I can pick some up from your place."
"You could have lived a little longer."
"Have I ever asked you for a favor?"
"I've been good all day."
"Is there one for that?"
"Put on something elegant quickly."
"I know that's how it is."
"Why are you so nice to me?"
"I miss you and I love you."
"No, it's not a dream."
"Do you want me to read it to you?"
"Did you give him new cards?"
"You're cuter than I thought."
"He's the one you need."
"You don't want me to wait?"
"He will have to do this in two places."
"I thought you forgot about me."
"I said I would try."
"What if he asks where you are?"
"Is it safe to let her go?"
"Life is God's choice."
"Do you know what you need?"
"I need you to believe me."
"What did you do with my father?"
"I'll see how it goes."
"What is there to add?"
"I am absolutely certain of it."
"Turn around and go away."
"I'm coming from the mailbox."
"Can you tell me where he is?"
"I have a son and a daughter."
"Did you tell him where we were?"
"Take your torches and return to camp."
"Who needs us in Moscow?"
"I'll get a glass of water."
"No, I have what it takes."
"Large capital and few men."
"Few people have a destiny, Lawrence."
"I know what she means."
"And all's well that ends well."
"Two bulls or six, it's the same."
"I knew what that meant."
"It has to look real."
"What do we do to him?"
"It's not nearly that simple."
"I don't want her to come."
"You're not a cop, are you?"
"We will find common ground."
"Let's see if the referee will count it."
"Don't let anyone convince you otherwise."
"Can I use your bathroom?"
"Can I use your bathroom?"
"Tell me when it's time."
"How many times do I have to repeat myself?"
"It's time to go to work."
"Yet he is here, I assure you."
"She didn't come home."
"I'm glad I found you."
"You see, that's the thing."
"It's house policy."
"I'll call you tomorrow, you let me know."
"I'm telling you it's good."
"What are you singing to him?"
"Here are my three meals, smart guy."
"So what are you doing?"
"He reminded me of you."
"I told you to get dressed."
"I can take care of it myself."
"But what are you waiting for?"
"I feel sorry for you."
"For your own good, give up your idea."
"I demand to know who you are."
"So, what did you want to talk to me about?"
"As rare as the Manhattan phone book."
"I know what it is."
"The man with the cabbage head."
"Do your parents know where you are?"
"That's what I used to do."
"When did you start smoking?"
"I wanted to thank you for recording."
"Yes, if he gets his way."
"You owe him a ton of money."
"Is this the one?"
"Tell her you're going to take her out."
"He's almost part of the family."
"Fighting is teamwork."
"You will never be the same again."
"Are we sure this is true?"
"She always has a shovel around there."
"These are the house rules."
"Please, time is running out."
"Everything your body needs."
"What are you doing here at this hour?"
"We will call you before H-hour."
"I was the happiest kid."
"Sorry it's under these circumstances."
"You didn't come by camel?"
"This is the chance of a lifetime."
"Call me when you get this message."
"Go ahead, have a drink, have fun."
"It made me think of us."
"So far, I've been having a good day."
"Please don't do it again."
"Because you could really use it."
"The Don is half retired."
"She's here because of you."
"I have it on the big screen."
"Men will be backstage with Tony."
"She wasn't home."
"I still feel his presence in me."
"Eat this, it feels so good."
"You shot him in the back."
"Robinson didn't tell us."
"Tell me what you're going to do."
"He had a fight with your husband."
"You saw how he looked at her."
"I raised him."
"I think I've said it all."
"Does this sound familiar?"
"I thought you might like that."
"Gather some of your best assassins."
"How about we go for a walk?"
"But what are you looking at?"
"You have the man for the job."
"I think he doesn't know anything."
"What do you think he's playing at?"
"And where does it happen for me?"
"You feel good, I'm happy."
"He taught me."
"Did I do the right thing?"
"It didn't go as planned."
"It's the living room on your right."
"Do you want to stay here all night?"
"I need to talk to you."
"Let her wear what she wants."
"Do you have a license for this kid?"
"Introducing the legendary Denny Z."
"At the entrance to the afterlife."
"We thought he was our friend."
"We'll see each other then."
"What do you see when you look at me?"
"What should I answer?"
"They should be ready in a few years."
"Let me hug you."
"The toilets are at the end of the corridor."
"Catherine is very sweet and very kind."
"I had to get your attention."
"Did the cat eat your tongue?"
"What can it do?"
"What am I going to tell?"
"I promised my mother."
"Who said I was?"
"I have everything I want."
"Water down your wine."
"It will be settled in no time."
"There's a package for you."
"I'm here for one reason."
"Is it just about sex?"
"He knows what it's about."
"Is this what communication means to you?"
"If you had a job, you would understand."
"What else is 'out of the zone'?"
"I have things well in hand."
"Who is Lowell's pride now?"
"There is a very simple explanation."
"So, what does it look like?"
"I am with you all the way."
"What am I saying here?"
"I already told you yesterday."
"He tells you to stir the sauce."
"You promised to stay close by."
"He has to get out of this."
"One life in exchange for another."
"I catch him and release him."
"Who's standing next to me?"
"I just need to be told when."
"Let us pray that this never happens."
"Because it's worth it."
"You're the one who horrifies me."
"But where have you been for so long?"
"You're the one who's going to do it."
"I put the cat next to it."
"Where are my mother and sister?"
"If you want it, it's there."
"It's nice of you to visit us."
"Will we ever manage to get back?"
"They don't need that."
"The most surprising knockout ever seen."
"Ambrose is with a guy at the bar."
"I swear I don't know anything."
"Do you think I have a microphone?"
"Do you know that I liked him?"
"He wants us to move the island."
"I've spent my whole life here."
"I have a gift for you too."
"There is an opportunity to be seized."
"I want to have a baby with you."
"Can we go?"
"I know you don't want to."
"And I'm so proud of you."
"How long have you been married?"
"What else do you know about me?"
"You already asked me this question."
"I now pronounce you husband and wife."
"I have to go to America for three months."
"I wonder what's happening to her."
"It's not: 'Where is he?'"
"How kind of you."
"It is the cocoon of an insect."
"It is four floors underground."
"So what would you do?"
"As if he was going to tell me."
"What's wrong with you, huh?"
"I have a proposition for my father."
"But I have something to say."
"Once famous, he left you."
"I was wondering where you had gone."
"You're on TV again."
"Could I have some water?"
"Is my father here?"
"Did you put it under the bed?"
"The difference between us and machines."
"I have an organization behind me."
"The only thing that is pure, clean."
"Everyone wanted to please him."
"Tell me what to say."
"But where is he?"
"She knows what she did."
"Glad you remember me."
"I waited outside all night."
"Haven't seen it yet?"
"Tony, what's going on?"
"And you agree with that?"
"Can we talk about this another time?"
"No need for the governor's reward."
"With anyone, anywhere."
"Relax, we'll take care of the rest."
"We have everything we want."
"I saw her running out."
"That's right, he makes underwear."
"Can I have something to drink?"
"I'm just a utility, right?"
"It was self-defense, right?"
"He said I could come?"
"I think I can do that."
"Do you have any idea?"
"What does she want to prove?"
"I was on the news for three minutes."
"I found it in the parking lot."
"You're the one who's naive, aren't you?"
"Someone got shot."
"But in a good way."
"He'll be here in half an hour."
"Do you know what she took?"
"No, we don't need it."
"Who are you to give advice?"
"Put the scarecrow near that tree."
"It's getting more and more interesting."
"We will have the opportunity to see each other again."
"I wanted to say I'm sorry."
"Or soar high in the clouds."
"I thought we would make it."
"And I know you will."
"They are found in the computer system."
"I will stay awake to prevent him."
"There are people here tonight."
"No, that's not my style."
"A pretty young woman to excite him."
"I love conversations that start like this."
"Years and years of practice."
"Yes my love, you come before God."
"Do you want to go out tonight?"
"I never promised you anything."
"That's all she wants."
"It was never the right time."
"I like you too, my chick."
"I grew up in a small town."
"I've been investigating him for three years."
"It went better than expected."
"Show some respect."
"I don't think you understand."
"You're the one who should go."
"She was making great progress, and that was it."
"Okay, I got it, I got it."
"It was my mother's idea."
"I don't have much to say."
"Except they did that in America."
"Don't you want to eat something?"
"I've heard of this before."
"Don't tell me that."
"I helped build these cells."
"It's for the Mascot Contest."
"No, we have to go."
"Did you see who did that?"
"Check, he just turned due north."
"It's time you knew."
"It's the past, it's far away."
"How long do you have?"
"And I have a surprise for you."
"He knows I betrayed him."
"Need freedom, you know who to vote for."
"Tell your men to stand down."
"This is what you need."
"This may be good news."
"Tell me you have his location."
"If you want to call it that."
"Is this how you work?"
"It's like this every morning."
"They don't answer our calls."
"If you get it right, you'll be free."
"But he's just a kid."
"I remember you very well."
"She has a little crisis at times."
"I will do everything to find him."
"I say what the other would say?"
"Do you think it's a male?"
"Is there anything to do?"
"He was twice the size of the other one."
"Do you want us to get out of here?"
"Only one guy can decide for you."
"It looks like some kind of padlock."
"That's good, eat your candy."
"Are you going to force me to do it?"
"I was paid to be there."
"There's someone down there."
"Don't I get a kiss?"
"But I have nothing better."
"It's time to close the door."
"First the stone, then the doctor."
"I just met the good fairy."
"You're right, we had an agreement."
"He is leaving us."
"You will see the station right away."
"This is my wife and daughter."
"You should not read this book."
"She didn't say goodbye."
"What can you tell me about him?"
"I have one in my bag."
"I need to turn the page."
"And you, are you okay?"
"Who has a message for Germany?"
"What was he doing in the common room?"
"It's the same as yours."
"What happened to your face?"
"Two or three years ago."
"Is this the second password?"
"Ed Miller was a good friend of mine."
"You'll have to get used to it."
"I have a lot of work to finish."
"I sent out tons of resumes."
"Is that really what you think?"
"You deserve each other."
"We're treating you, and you're feeling better."
"Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure."
"Don't you remember us?"
"Last month you said two weeks."
"The doctor who was there last night?"
"You have blue eyes, so do I."
"This is the moment you've all been waiting for."
"You will need to watch the volume button."
"I asked everyone."
"Go to the window on your left."
"What are you two talking about?"
"How long have you been here?"
"But wasn't that the question?"
"You put him back in his place."
"And what was the lesson of the day?"
"That's what we wanted, right?"
"I thought I was fighting to be champion."
"It is an honor and a pleasure."
"Think about what they put in it."
"Maybe they don't like humans."
"You must come with us."
"He knows, he wants to talk, I buy."
"Are you a businessman or a journalist?"
"He wants us to get back together."
"I told him to be careful."
"Please let me in."
"How many women have you slept with?"
"I have a good diet book."
"I'll show you on the map."
"How could I let this happen?"
"No reason not to."
"My friends are not murderers."
"Your mother told me."
"I threw it out into the street."
"What changed him?"
"Lord, shine your light upon us."
"How long have you been working here?"
"Blue is when you're pregnant."
"I took her in my arms."
"If it's not the smoker."
"Do you want to watch the World Cup?"
"I hope you will be happy here."
"But let me tell you something."
"I welcomed you into this world."
"Saturday was brides' night."
"They don't know what they want."
"But someone was there this morning."
"Why are you so good to me?"
"But I wanted to tell you something."
"So write that down in your diary."
"Your god chooses to remain silent."
"I'm already happy to be here."
"I can taste them in my mouth."
"How long have you had this?"
"I'll give you a call."
"She keeps calling me."
"I told him, he checks everything."
"What's going on, son?"
"I know you're still here."
"It must be one of them."
"He has to go."
"My agent says it's important."
"Bring it to me, along with the device."
"Have you noticed what I'm doing?"
"There are weapons everywhere here."
"We'll see that when I see you."
"What are you playing?"
"I thought we were done."
"You only think about your own interests."
"I play in the big leagues."
"Can I see some ID?"
"Thank you for taking care of her."
"I think this is for you."
"What were you doing there?"
"And the day you learn them?"
"I can make everything go back to the way it was."
"I was right next to him."
"How are you doing up there?"
"I don't think I can."
"I asked you to sit down."
"I know she did."
"Let's look through the looking glass."
"There was another one."
"No, but she called me Brad."
"You reminded me of him."
"You need to sign for the owners."
"That's the way things are."
"Did your mother tell you about me?"
"Do you serve those who come without a maid?"
"She looks very good to me."
"Thanks, but I'll drink it here."
"I forgot to tell you."
"Others fight for His cause."
"But it's really good."
"I knew you would come for me."
"What was this little conversation leading to?"
"Other than that, everything is fine."
"I'm here to set the record straight."
"I forgot what I was saying."
"They have been identified, that's for sure."
"It was the limelight."
"It's a slaughterhouse in itself."
"You took a bullet for me."
"It was beyond my strength."
"I just like him, that's all."
"I always had other desires."
"I'll call you later."
"You are in the house of God."
"Look, I was told to cooperate."
"But it's you I love."
"Am I going to have to drink this hot coffee?"
"I should be paid to watch this."
"I think that's a good sign."
"I've never seen her like this."
"Honey, where are you going?"
"I have information on Hannibal Lecter."
"There were just the two of us."
"I have to use the bathroom."
"So what does it give?"
"Professor, what is this?"
"You lure him with food."
"But where have you been?"
"You should come to my house for a few weeks."
"What are you doing to yourself?"
"She is the most beautiful in the world."
"People made big sacrifices."
"By the Lord and His Almighty Power."
"I want you to come."
"Did he tell you where he was going?"
"He had a lot of change on him."
"But at least from there you will see."
"I absolutely have to talk to him."
"And that's what we will do."
"Meet at the hangar area."
"Such was the price of your crown."
"Do you know where I can find some?"
"Did you put this?"
"Maybe I'll sell shoes."
"Is it normal for him to be here?"
"That's because he is."
"Did you find it?"
"I am very happy to be here."
"She is not at her desk."
"You're no better than him."
"Your green light for a special operation."
"I don't think he's coming back."
"I don't want another girl."
"I'm just helping out."
"I think I'll say yes."
"I can't even talk to you."
"You're not Rosebud?"
"Everything in my power."
"Hit the head, but work the body."
"Is there any mail for me?"
"I had to become someone else."
"He's outside changing the oil."
"If you're right about the guns."
"I like that you're here."
"No other man can touch her."
"Basically, they see things differently."
"Everything related to the game."
"I wonder what he looks like."
"I remembered something."
"You have people under your responsibility."
"This salt comes from the Indian Ocean."
"There must be a freight elevator."
"I had two glasses of wine."
"As if time had stopped."
"I am the last of my kind."
"Time to kiss those sweet handcuffs."
"And when were you going to tell me?"
"We need to talk in private."
"Either one is fine with me."
"I have a secret to tell you."
"At least we have that in common."
"Where we found the black book."
"I think it's best to go home."
"They can say whatever they want."
"Yes, that's it, that's it."
"Are you thinking of someone in particular?"
"But he's a good, honest guy."
"Tell me what you're doing here."
"It's like I won."
"I knew it from the start."
"I found it in his jacket."
"But our species have a common ancestor."
"See you tomorrow at school."
"What are you going to do with this money?"
"Do you like England and Arabia?"
"You always react the same way."
"A very curious performance from Micky Ward."
"That's what I know how to do."
"As if I've heard it before."
"Show them what we are capable of."
"Have you seen Lawrence since he returned?"
"We are aware of the situation."
"By the end of the week."
"Billy, it's the house that treats."
"His voice was frighteningly true."
"What do we do there?"
"They left for the weekend."
"She didn't want to talk to me."
"What did she mean?"
"You go into the field with Crawford."
"But you have to listen to me."
"I heard about Life magazine."
"That's what I wanted to tell you."
"I would like to talk to you about something."
"I have a patient nearby."
"Let's move on to analyzing this simulation."
"Do you have a second to spare?"
"You need stitches."
"What is your mother's name?"
"Your captains will be your aides-de-camp."
"Do you have something to show me?"
"Who's going to take care of you, darling?"
"Maybe it's not so bad."
"Arabia is part of his empire."
"Have you never flown before?"
"No one knows how you did it."
"Where have you been?"
"I'll be down in a minute."
"He lives across the street from me."
"I was a friend of your dad."
"Because she made a choice."
"What do you think it does to me?"
"That is, a certain number."
"Because you seemed nice."
"How do you feel?"
"Let him do what he wants."
"It will take him more than six weeks."
"What have you done in your life?"
"What do we do, Red?"
"How could you do this to me?"
"She can drink here whenever she wants."
"I was told about the prescription."
"Who wants to play bridge after dinner?"
"It did me a world of good."
"I had nothing to say to him."
"How long did it take you?"
"That was nine centuries ago."
"And there we will talk about your future."
"I have my whole life ahead of me."
"Show me what you ate."
"I was just passing by, that's all."
"She opens her eyes out of pure reflex."
"I've always been in love with you."
"The generator will start."
"What did she say about me?"
"I brought you some water."
"It's about your mother."
"We both did it."
"I knew you could do it."
"Have you ever thought about that?"
"You only had one thing to do."
"Customs had a record of him."
"It better be me."
"Did you bring the plastic men?"
"I was just beginning to have fun."
"I could have had class."
"It's you I'm asking."
"I'm glad you're home."
"Maybe we should say a prayer?"
"Thank you so much for coming tonight."
"Since I came back from the future."
"I should have told you before."
"He said he knew you."
"A topic of interest between pubs."
"I'll tell you in a minute."
"I'm glad you're happy."
"I am a friend of your son."
"Where are we going, swimming?"
"Your friendship can send you underground."
"Do you want to train with your brother?"
"I saw them with my own eyes."
"He is a very tough young man."
"She has her head screwed on."
"I don't think we can."
"It's nice of you to visit me."
"Let's go, we'll be there at dawn."
"I know just the guy."
"Did he follow me?"
"Everyone has a different name."
"To show him a good time."
"You want to play this with me."
"I have never taken drugs."
"I've got my eye on you, kid."
"You look good, your eyes are clear."
"Need I say more?"
"Tell him what I said."
"Your son, the flesh of your flesh."
"I would like to write a feature article."
"You wanted to have fun last night."
"You think I did that?"
"I am here as a friend."
"A man needs a name."
"Let me in, please."
"That's all we ask."
"Maybe we got rid of it."
"I sent them before your wife."
"I helped him, that's all."
"Where is the nearest unit?"
"Do I look like a cop?"
"I told you, Dad."
"Is it me or is it hot?"
"You've never heard of it?"
"We were the ones who wanted one."
"A price has been put on our heads."
"When she's done, take her out."
"Would you like to repeat your statement to us?"
"I want what's mine."
"It's you I'm thinking of."
"That's what we were talking about."
"Oh, he was a very handsome boy."
"Do you have a minute?"
"Have you read one of my books?"
"Curfew time has passed."
"That's for me to say."
"She wasn't like this before."
"That's what I hope."
"But what are you?"
"What if someone saw you?"
"We have a lot in common."
"You can't do that to them."
"We see each other from time to time."
"Is this someone we know?"
"Grab your bags and form ranks."
"You don't owe me an apology."
"Where were you hiding?"
"You're right, you're always right."
"I could go take a closer look."
"I think you'll be fine here."
"We all have a face to hide."
"Do you know what you're asking me?"
"I'm sure he'll score."
"You are the father of the nation."
"There's something else that's bothering me."
"He knows what he did."
"He only thinks of himself."
"Dad said it."
"From the end of Return of the Jedi."
"What would you have done?"
"Is there a way, doctor?"
"Did you tell them who you were?"
"You just stood there staring at me."
"Maybe I'll have one one day."
"Can't you wait a little?"
"Can I borrow it for a moment?"
"This is a portrait of his father."
"How much time do you need?"
"The password for the evening?"
"She changes, and we go out together."
"Be careful what you ask for."
"Why do you always say that?"
"Parking is prohibited here."
"I would like to spend the nights with her."
"All this to enrich other families."
"He went to a lot of trouble."
"Maybe I'm out of it."
"I had one once."
"The most important thing is to stay calm."
"I have more in reserve."
"I'm sure you're right."
"Is that what betrayed me?"
"I thought about you all the time."
"She was a wonderful woman, so beautiful."
"She can turn me into a real boy."
"Don't give him anything from your plate."
"What happens to pregnant women?"
"A visit that never took place."
"This is an important evening for us."
"They have been trying for many years."
"I have just what I need."
"I have never seen you before."
"Do you know where the Blue Fairy lives?"
"It is an honor and a privilege."
"There is a way out."
"Did she say anything to you?"
"It would be nice if it were true."
"I know what you said."
"You're almost one of us."
"A human rights lawyer."
"He was the love of my life."
"There is no list."
"I'm going to see Caitlin at the hospital."
"You will be the first to know."
"But keep your real name secret."
"You know I need it."
"I'm the one with the money."
"Who has ever done chemistry?"
"I invited him."
"It's so good to meet you."
"They went to dinner at a cabaret."
"I'll be there as soon as I'm done."
"He is my mother's father."
"You have a bright future ahead of you."
"I want to speak to Mr. Edward Wilson."
"The year is almost over, Brighton."
"You understand what could happen, right?"
"What are you doing on Saturday?"
"I found this in the garage."
"What will I say to my next sources?"
"Did you say I was good?"
"You didn't make love?"
"Can I have the password?"
"This is the one I came for."
"My head is spinning."
"You better get used to it."
"Now tell me who is behind this."
"I want you to do your job."
"I don't want an incident."
"My wife is giving birth."
"I need a new job."
"What does he have to gain from it?"
"I'm sure he can pay."
"I let myself be guided by my conscience."
"I forgot you were here."
"We have the family's agreement."
"Mom, what's wrong with you?"
"I want to do something for her."
"As far back as I can remember."
"You can have whatever you want."
"That's where you have to look."
"No one else did it."
"What won't work?"
"What are we telling each other?"
"Where did it come from?"
"Yes, what do you want?"
"Make bacon or ham out of it."
"I think you don't understand."
"I thought you were my friend."
"I thought you were my friend."
"Will we finish what we started?"
"Do you still have feelings for her?"
"I thought I was finished."
"Are you the only one living there?"
"You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday."
"No, it's just us."
"Yes, that's what I believe."
"And that a third goes beyond this intersection."
"You have to find someone else."
"Would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
"Tomorrow is a long day of driving."
"In that case, I'll go."
"Shall I tell you about my day at the office?"
"I do what she loved to do."
"You are the first of your kind."
"But he never said anything."
"And what do you think?"
"It's my uncle's birthday."
"Even if it's not true."
"I'll take care of that later."
"This is what we needed."
"We have other fish to fry."
"I have something else to talk to you about."
"Yes, that's what you say."
"You see me in a vendetta mood."
"What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?"
"This is the state of Mississippi, here."
"You said you wanted to talk."
"What have you become?"
"Take the pictures, leave me the titles."
"Red is the color of the gods."
"What's going on with him?"
"What will we do with you?"
"May the Force be with you, Master."
"You have to come see this."
"I have to get used to it."
"I am the one who called you."
"I feel like I'm going to like it."
"What happened to my car?"
"You want to know how I know?"
"Can you do something for me?"
"I released the oxygen masks."
"I think about him all the time."
"You think I don't know?"
"Yeah, what's going on?"
"I spent my life in America."
"You should get your hair cut."
"The English are hungry for wide open spaces."
"You just have to follow me."
"Was it presented to you like that?"
"I have to get back to work."
"Any idea what it was?"
"Not something you can program."
"There is nothing better."
"I know what you are capable of."
"He said it was you."
"I'll get it back to you as soon as possible."
"Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"This will be the music of battle."
"It's my turn to speak."
"I loved you right away."
"It's just for a little while."
"She reminds me a lot of you."
"It's early for cartoons."
"Are you sure it's okay?"
"Thank you for coming to tell me."
"I know who it is."
"No, that's not the one."
"You put the money here first."
"I use it every day."
"I had my face redone."
"It helps me to have a goal."
"We've always needed you."
"I want us to make love."
"That's all he is."
"Do you believe in Jesus Christ, Our Lord?"
"I have to go to the store."
"I will not answer any more questions."
"I have control of the situation."
"You-Know-Who to return to power."
"I had something to tell you."
"Then she had other guys."
"You should come and wish him a good trip."
"You need to get some fresh air."
"I'll call you when I get there."
"I have to say goodnight to the little ones."
"What is this here?"
"That must mean something."
"I'm going to pull myself together and make an effort."
"I move things with my brain."
"Thank you for saving our lives."
"Maybe you should see a doctor."
"Not if I see you first."
"Haven't you heard the radio?"
"She's amazing, isn't she?"
"What would we do with it?"
"That was the first thing to do."
"Will you listen to me?"
"I want to get this thing over with."
"It's a piece of cake, you're relaxed."
"For example, the origin of these signals."
"You only think of yourself."
"I think I know what he's looking for."
"My eldest son is in sales."
"Would you like another glass of wine?"
"You'd better go then."
"Now it's your little friends' turn."
"It was his decision, not mine."
"I want to know what you think."
"There is more to life."
"I thought it was over."
"That's all he has left."
"You want to know what I have?"
"It's time to tell me everything."
"Give my compliments to your master."
"It's time to shine again."
"You could at least hide the bottle."
"You knew exactly what you were doing."
"Just after a nice right from Ward."
"Was it enough to face Sugar Ray?"
"How long are you here for?"
"Do you hear the noise of that mill?"
"I know what you have to do."
"I'm at my summer camp."
"It's a bit the same thing."
"Love is stronger than anything."
"My saliva feels like cotton wool."
"I think we found it."
"This is the end of our show."
"Maybe this is a sign."
"That's what the sign says."
"Do you believe that informing changes things?"
"I thought you might like to know."
"I can make a few calls."
"I love him with all my heart."
"You taught me a valuable lesson."
"I'm going to stay here in this shack."
"I'll buy you dinner in town."
"We'll bring him home."
"For me, this game is a competition."
"I tried to tell him."
"Do you want to change the subject?"
"What was that again?"
"Your sister left the office on Friday."
"I already told you, no."
"I can give you money."
"He needs to know that too."
"What do you have to say to that?"
"What do you have to say to that?"
"As long as he is healthy."
"I saw a bar over there."
"That's what brothers do."
"It will be because I want it."
"Let's go before the Germans arrive."
"Have I been clear?"
"It's like being there."
"Grab your stuff and let's go."
"Have you ever been with a girl?"
"Right in the real world, right?"
"Call a truce for lunch."
"He knows it, he won't talk."
"I shot him in the head."
"Is there a back door?"
"I knew it would come to this."
"Did you set this up?"
"I wonder if that's true."
"What else can I tell you?"
"You mean he's here?"
"This is exactly what you wanted."
"He has never been happier."
"What happened to the ball?"
"You didn't say much."
"Christ does not live in them."
"Listen, something happened."
"It's a beautiful smile contest."
"There's something down there."
"Because it means something."
"Your newspaper has had a lot of influence."
"Something is happening between us."
"Would you please come down and talk to me?"
"What if he wasn't?"
"Maybe it's a better name."
"Not if you designed the place."
"She said she was sorry."
"I know I can do it."
"I am happy where I am."
"I have exactly what you want."
"I was just calling you."
"How long did it stay attached?"
"But because it didn't exist."
"He's their pianist right now."
"Maybe, if I saw the file."
"Little man-boy with beady eyes."
"If you want it, it will be there."
"I think it's the opposite."
"Have you researched me?"
"He has to get into her."
"Can't you drive any faster?"
"I want to talk to you about your tape."
"Let's talk about what happened."
"I think I have the answer."
"What happened to the house?"
"That's what I wanted to see."
"You know exactly what it is."
"In accordance with the pioneer code."
"A man rises to the foreground."
"I just want to go on the show."
"I've worked in a lot of bars."
"Everything I ever wanted."
"I'm so happy to see you."
"Have you lived here all your life?"
"Nor why the birds no longer sing."
"I would do a few more hours."
"That's what she needs."
"And there are others."
"I'll put you back in your place."
"Wait. I'll be there in a second."
"I have friends in the industry."
"He was in business with my father."
"I discovered it myself."
"I don't trust him at all."
"For the first time in his life."
"This is the man you are looking for."
"You could have done it yourself."
"I even married a vampire woman."
"I carried the baby up the stairs."
"I saw something inexplicable."
"There may be a reason."
"The river is straight east."
"She risked her life for me."
"It takes two to catch Jesse."
"I thought it was for tomorrow."
"This one there, and this one here."
"We'll take care of you later."
"Just for who you are."
"Does he know?"
"I must prepare for prayer."
"You are the one who will listen to me."
"You must be good and go to bed."
"Of course I want to marry you."
"Did you want to give me a little kiss?"
"She is my father's wife."
"Please come with me."
"I never really loved you."
"And I will protect you instead of him."
"Have you talked to your father about this?"
"Is that what you want to do?"
"I saw your bank statement."
"The second act is called 'the effect'."
"That's the understatement of the year."
"Just ask."
"What do you want us to do with it?"
"Do you still love him?"
"You'll see them again, I promise."
"That's what we do here."
"Do what your mother said."
"Body and mind are one."
"It's just habit, that's all."
"I feel sorry for them."
"He knew what was going on there."
"No, I didn't say that."
"I have these hallucinations and visions."
"A flash in a copper conductor."
"This part of my life is over."
"It's your turn to go."
"No, how dare you even think that?"
"It's up to her to do it."
"There are some all the time."
"How could you let this happen?"
"Did you see that?"
"Try the second one from the top."
"You didn't mention Bob."
"I prepare them and you drink them."
"But you know you love it."
"Two sides of the same coin."
"You weren't answering my calls."
"There is a door over there."
"Your title entitles you to the throne."
"Please let us go."
"And the Great Eye is ever vigilant."
"I can never go home."
"I was saving the place for you, Father."
"We need to get everyone out."
"No, I didn't talk to him."
"He will say the prayer in the garden."
"Now is the time to do it."
"I'm going to call our band that."
"He still has a bit of breath left."
"Yes, something happened."
"I should never have faced him."
"I knew you were going to do that."
"I really need to talk to him."
"I told you I was working."
"The password, please?"
"I have an electric jet project."
"We did it for him."
"That's all he deserves."
"I get tired of repeating this sentence."
"What did he drink?"
"What exactly is going on?"
"I need a ride."
"What will you do when it's all over?"
"That's what we planned."
"I will change the color of your Fairy."
"I'm coming to see if everything is okay."
"Ask if he got the letter."
"They want to see what's going on."
"Please pay attention to the drawings."
"He puts it in his left pocket."
"Change your life, completely."
"I did everything by the book."
"Tell me what that means."
"I'm retiring next year."
"That was fifteen years ago."
"No one can change their destiny now."
"Power is dropping across the entire network."
"You have to trap them in a subtle way."
"Do you know you are under oath?"
"I took what I wanted."
"What if we don't?"
"Do you want some too, kiddo?"
"So we'll have to try something else."
"I have him in my sights."
"I'm done with men."
"You don't sound sure."
"You have something that belongs to me."
"I know boys your age."
"Do you want coffee or something else?"
"He had to go shopping."
"You're the one who said 'king'."
"It depends on who you ask."
"Can I know what you're doing?"
"There you are, working for Tobacco."
"I thought it would never end."
"It's a great relief for me."
"Are you sure it's there?"
"Are you sure it's there?"
"Who's going to put a stop to this, Senator?"
"What is written there?"
"It will be just like old times."
"She said I could stay."
"It is time for us to act."
"I also cover sensitive issues there."
"I want to talk to you about it in person."
"Tell me you have something else."
"This is where it happened."
"I spoke with accounting yesterday."
"That's all you get."
"One of my former bodyguards."
"I thought we trusted each other."
"And who does their work there?"
"It's my sister's wedding."
"I feel a question of form coming."
"Finally, I was the one who spoke."
"We must bring him home."
"Stick your chest out by raising your arms."
"It's his way of expressing himself."
"Maybe that's all it is."
"Did you spend the whole night there?"
"You weren't serious last night?"
"How are things at home?"
"I'm sure it's her."
"Did you throw the towel on the floor?"
"I remember that day."
"Who do you think did this?"
"I decided it."
"I did it for the money."
"I need to know something."
"What interests you so much?"
"I think it's his hand."
"Is that how you answer?"
"Please, let's find an agreement."
"She looks like she's having fun."
"Angel says it's time."
"No rush, take her to a psychiatrist."
"As if there was any logic."
"I just want to hear you say it."
"Did you see or hear anyone?"
"I have that effect on people."
"Where do we come from?"
"I am the love of his life."
"What distracted you?"
"I just wanted to go home."
"Even if you are already very beautiful."
"I said goodbye to Lydia."
"Believe me, it's not fun."
"Circle around the card reader."
"Kyle, what are you doing?"
"I told you to come here."
"The future would be so simple and beautiful."
"Did they give you new teeth?"
"She must have been wearing them before I was born."
"Well, I'll tell you."
"How could I not be?"
"You can see that it's closed."
"I am fully aware of that."
"I want her to be happy."
"A friend's surveillance company."
"Was this helpful?"
"How do you know what is feasible?"
"It might snow."
"This is what I offer you."
"I saw you in your works."
"Take a tie so we can come in."
"The first part is called 'the pact'."
"But I was sure of his affection."
"The crew wishes you a safe journey."
"It's my turn to introduce you."
"It's not mine either."
"I think you are unaware of its extent."
"When do they have your recruitment method?"
"Come inside, or you'll feel my hand."
"I try to think of something else."
"Actually I draw all the time."
"I put you on the list."
"Go play in your room for a while."
"You still don't understand, do you?"
"He did everything."
"I have nothing else to do."
"They just want some food."
"It will take a few minutes."
"You must have Jedi reflexes."
"I therefore pronounce you husband and wife."
"What do you do when it wakes you up?"
"I thought it was a dream."
"Now he has me by the throat."
"I bet he hits a mine."
"Take all the time you want."
"But what if I don't succeed?"
"It was a one-night stand."
"Maybe I'm imagining things."
"It's my only reason for living."
"You can go whenever you want."
"Wouldn't he be in love with you?"
"You just show up at my house like that?"
"Did you say you wanted to stay?"
"We'll see what his chances are."
"We'll see what you're worth."
"You hid me there once."
"It's about my brother."
"But we don't need anything."
"That's what we decided."
"I said he was gone."
"I prefer to place my trust in him."
"I know he was your friend."
"I wondered where she had gone."
"The wind always comes from the west."
"I'll show you how much."
"Where do you want us to put them?"
"The device has very powerful headlights."
"Did you hear gunshots?"
"But I need a partner."
"He was the one who found it."
"That's all I hear."
"No need for that, it's quiet."
"What do I tell them?"
"The doctor says she can travel."
"You know things, I feel it."
"Do you want me to come see you?"
"Once you're gone, don't think about it anymore."
"I need to say something."
"No. I did it myself."
"She only has me in the world."
"You haven't told him anything yet?"
"I thought you liked me."
"Yes, but we have control here."
"Now everything has to do with God."
"I have to go to high school."
"What do you do next?"
"I think I'll keep it."
"The last one was maybe less strong?"
"Lecter did it for fun."
"I heard a man's voice."
"I think we should split up."
"I can't handle this right now."
"Who will we find to replace him?"
"Is that right, you fainted?"
"You know we can do it."
"Do you want to make me another one?"
"What's keeping us here?"
"Honey, I have to ask you."
"There will be three of us watching over you."
"Do you know what we could do?"
"With all due respect, I don't think so."
"So give me one of those."
"Do you know what's going to happen to you?"
"You can see it whenever you want."
"And it came to me like that."
"What are you doing again?"
"Do you think she's well kept?"
"The one who brings light, wisdom and kindness."
"How dare you talk to me like that?"
"I never meant for this to happen."
"A story tells what happens."
"You were always the strongest."
"What does that give us?"
"I have a sense of direction."
"Even more than you think."
"There is a passage above."
"He introduced me to everyone."
"This is the symbolic importance of the gesture."
"I know what you can do."
"Is that all you have?"
"Maybe it was about him."
"Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?"
"I know you're hiding something."
"I learned a lot from my father."
"What was on that badge?"
"I know what you've been through."
"One for me and one for you."
"It's a two-hour drive."
"I don't know anything about him."
"I have the address you wanted."
"We'll talk about all that later."
"It's just like you said."
"I could do this all night."
"For the network, we all are."
"I need you for a second."
"Do you prefer a table, or the bar?"
"This is my favorite part."
"What is the purpose of all this?"
"I have a date with a girl."
"I have a knot in my stomach."
"God knows what she's capable of."
"No one was to hear what he was saying."
"Do with me what you want."
"Try to find your parents among them."
"I think I can handle this."
"I can't really talk to you."
"It's an honor to be here."
"I thought you'd like it."
"Have you tried the training program?"
"I saw it in your eyes."
"Can I talk to you about something?"
"He says he did it."
"Do you want me to open the window?"
"What have you been doing all this time?"
"What about your daughter?"
"Supposedly to write a tourist guide."
"Did she say something about me?"
"Tonight, I'm the one treating you."
"Please don't hang up."
"If you live to be old, you will see her."
"What are we looking for then?"
"I have experienced many important moments."
"He wants my job, my girlfriend."
"A white shepherd with his black sheep."
"Are we going to your place?"
"I have to be in order."
"I already consider you my sister."
"Do you know what I could do?"
"What exactly do you expect from me?"
"Because I can afford it."
"How dare you turn your back on me?"
"I'm sorry for the last time."
"Oh, that was a long time ago."
"No need to stand out."
"Not in this life, anyway."
"You gave me hope."
"Everything is about to change."
"I'm glad you called."
"You do what you are asked."
"What's up this time?"
"She must get that from her mother."
"Sugar Ray said to call him."
"You're the one I'm going to marry."
"We love water and the forest."
"What am I doing to you?"
"It was nice to see you again."
"He remembered so many things."
"It's my stepfather's."
"And I have a surprise for you."
"Explain to me what happened."
"I don't think you can."
"I've already taken care of him."
"Isn't this noise over, Lin?"
"Do you think they spotted us?"
"I'll only be a minute."
"What happened to your car?"
"I came to tell you the beginning."
"He was the one who discovered it."
"If anyone listened, they knew everything."
"And maybe memorize the right level."
"Did this thought cross your mind?"
"Do you hear what I'm saying?"
"That is, everyone."
"It seems like they're talking about us."
"She was talking about a cute little guy."
"You came to tell me that?"
"I'll make a deal with you."
"Do you have any news about my daughter?"
"I found this in my bag."
"My cars are in my wife's name."
"Dinner will be ready in five minutes."
"Do you remember that day?"
"A birthday present from my father."
"You thought I wouldn't come?"
"It was never very solid."
"We must renounce all moral sense?"
"But that's just my opinion."
"But he leaves the basketball court."
"But there is another reason."
"But the owner demands to be paid."
"What do you want me to tell them?"
"Did he talk to you?"
"I lived mostly with my uncle."
"There are laws against that."
"I was told you were leaving."
"I want to push it to the end."
"Go buy yourself something nice."
"How much do you think it could bring in?"
"I found this in the kitchen."
"Based on his political beliefs."
"I thought you'd never call."
"I don't know anything about art."
"Can we see each other again?"
"Do you want to make a snowman?"
"It's like this all the time."
"Three games for the price of one."
"What does she like to do?"
"It's good to hear from you."
"You have to stick to the plan."
"She doesn't have much time left."
"Please don't do anything."
"You will speak when asked."
"Thank you for cheering me up."
"Is this how you see me?"
"I was hoping we were past that."
"What can I do for you, Mr. French?"
"The envelope is next week."
"I would like to live in another city."
"So it's simpler this way."
"You'll hear gunshots."
"I can just show you the door."
"I bought you a dishwasher."
"My son was one of a kind."
"Does he make you laugh?"
"The thing that goes with the fork."
"It has to stay that way."
"They know you are with me."
"Jesse looked at Bob with a melancholy look."
"Yes, I agree with you."
"Life has no meaning."
"I needed a change of scenery."
"I trusted my friends."
"The house where my father was born."
"Maybe he can't."
"But what are you waiting for?"
"Well, your son is an artist."
"Go to the nearest safe area."
"There may be a catch."
"I say he's popular."
"They want us to go with them."
"This is the one I rented."
"We do it twice as fast."
"If you have any questions, please ask."
"How long did it take you?"
"It only takes one voice."
"A visual, sound, but also spiritual dimension."
"Come to my mission, in San Carlos."
"How do you think I feel?"
"I know how it is here."
"I will be forever grateful to you."
"It's called 'Lily's Ocean'."
"What do the workers say about our action?"
"Since when do you speak in that tone?"
"You really have to see this."
"I'm not sure yet."
"They get along well, those two."
"Pass it to me, please."
"Can I ask you about this?"
"I need a Japanese blade."
"That's what I was thinking about."
"Someone has to take care of him."
"Is all this under your shack?"
"Can I hug you?"
"This is the one I'm talking about."
"Cut his meat and the table shakes."
"Tell them I'll take care of it."
"Thank you for your time."
"I think I know how you feel."
"A member of the brotherhood, I imagine."
"I thought you saw it."
"You were a little disrespectful to him."
"I'll let you both talk."
"I've never had an orgasm."
"It came to me suddenly."
"But we want justice to be done."
"In two or three games, you'll be ready."
"You can do one thing for me."
"Randy, what are you doing?"
"How did the autopsy go?"
"That's what the letter says."
"Would you come back to him?"
"I changed, I adapted."
"My God, what happened to you?"
"I have new teeth and everything."
"I found this in front of my door."
"Would you excuse me for a minute?"
"Something is happening at the restaurant."
"I told you he would come."
"We wanted something, we helped ourselves."
"There's something around here."
"I was sleeping on the living room couch."
"That's all they wanted."
"It lasted more than a month."
"She is getting better, she is regaining strength."
"You have to stay with her, commit."
"Of course I remember."
"What would you say to him?"
"She is at the top of her game."
"For the first time in years."
"That's why I wanted to see you."
"No one had ever told me that."
"It'll be okay, I swear."
"When you back up, it comes from behind."
"How do you want him to be?"
"Have you served in a similar house?"
"I knew what I had to do."
"For someone who wanted to say yes."
"Hello, what can I do for you?"
"Who only act for money."
"You are the one I chose."
"It's time for his nap."
"What could this mean?"
"Of course I'll tell him."
"I thought you were going to dinner?"
"The Empire has been finished since the war."
"I worked with him for six years."
"Do you believe in women's rights?"
"I would like to hug you."
"You've got balls to stay there."
"Was there anyone with you?"
"The aliens left with the crate."
"What do they want from him?"
"Have you seen what they're doing?"
"What if I don't go?"
"It was a few months ago."
"But I've never seen a ballet."
"I know it's over there."
"What about your father?"
"How can you say such a thing?"
"How can you say such a thing?"
"Anything you want, Mr. Reagan."
"My father was a businessman."
"I want to know what they're up to."
"Make them do what I wanted."
"It will become human again like that."
"Take what we need, gentlemen."
"Have the lambs stopped screaming?"
"You will have wanted it."
"I thought you left ten minutes ago."
"Please, stop the charade."
"Do with it what you see fit."
"The envelope is for peace of mind."
"Take your boy and go home."
"I spoke to him last night."
"This day is getting better and better."
"We need to talk about this."
"I will try to find a solution."
"I have to go and make an appearance."
"At least, that's what he says."
"There were a lot of customers."
"It's time to think about yourself."
"You don't need that, man."
"I saw a guy named Red."
"Did you call them?"
"Fireworks in the first minute."
"Who was Lowell's pride before?"
"You will be forced to make a choice."
"The Alliance had to come together now."
"This is what we want to discover."
"And the middle name will be 'Loyal'?"
"We are on our way back."
"I'll see if she's ready."
"Did he tell you?"
"I see what you did."
"He needs to be taken to the hospital."
"Haven't we already discussed this?"
"Not as long as I'm with you."
"From what I know, yes."
"You're going to screw us up."
"I was shot in the arm."
"I promise you'll stay in bed."
"I won't even answer that."
"Unless you don't want to."
"Password please."
"So what does this mean?"
"He seemed to be asking for advice."
"I will do what is necessary to avoid this."
"It must be stopped at all costs."
"What do I do with this guy?"
"How long has this thing been here?"
"We are rightly proud of this."
"It's beyond our means."
"They must be here for the sheep."
"We have the advantage of surprise."
"What will you be able to do?"
"It can be accessed via this climb."
"If you need anything."
"He knew the truth about the queen."
"I can find someone else."
"A friend of mine was wondering about that."
"I wanted to see you before you left."
"It destroys everything it touches."
"The Cylons were created by man."
"No, it's not really my thing."
"Imagine you bought a ticket."
"Who does this kind of stuff, man?"
"You didn't tell him?"
"I thought it was this way."
"What else did he do?"
"Do you find her prettier than me?"
"Do you really think you're going to win?"
"Open your mouth and stick out your tongue."
"I made you profit."
"The best years of my life."

"One for you and one for you."
"Well, that's about it."
"Is this your usual golf outfit?"

"Can't you see she's a child?"
"I put her in a taxi."
"When will we see each other?"
"Can you do something for me?"
"If we can bet, he will be there."
"We want to do business with you."
"I just bit my tongue."
"But these are just words."
"I'm sure he'll come home."
"You have to come with me."
"Why do we do what we do?"
"What do you want, Angel?"
"You can take care of the girlfriend."
"So I can go get your things."
"Who do you think these people were?"
"What were you two talking about?"
"What happened?"
"Have you been in contact with him?"
"Please let me go."
"Nor to let off steam on a Friday night."
"You brought him back to life."
"She's the best in the house."
"Try to understand what we are doing."
"Is that all you find?"
"I know what you should do."
"No, I had never seen it."
"You think I don't understand?"
"Do you want me to write it for you?"
"I don't know about the others."

"How many times have I told you."
"Many of you come to thank me."
"I'll show you if you show me."
"It's not done to ask."
"You play eight, right?"
"Put it back where you found it."
"A coffee, like in piano class?"
"Do you know what it could be?"
"What will I tell my father?"
"It's because of my hair."
"I saw you both."
"His body was found at his home."
"It looks like someone was there."
"Just say it, Earl."

"What happened last night?"
"We'll see each other when we see each other."
"Do I look like a gigolo?"
"And how long will it take?"
"Do you see anything over there, boss?"

"This is what you need to find out."
"The more they are, the better."
"You want a plane for the troops."
"Are you sure you want some?"
"I did this to protect you."
"Was he your father's lawyer?"
"I'll take it to Lopez myself."
"I thought that was my job."

"Do you have any idea of the monthly charges?"
"No, it's true, I assure you."
"Sail the ocean for eternity."
"I'll see how the others are doing."

"That's how I walk."
"Something could have happened to him."
"Did you stay there all night?"
"I wanted it."
"What's it like to be a hero?"
"If you think it's better."
"Tell me you can do it."
"I would have liked to do a lot of things."
"We will all see you again when you return."
"This is between your father and me."
"Is this the end of our adventure?"
"I saw him in my dream."
"But the real goal is power."
"Is it because of last night?"
"I told my father."
"You are looking at him."
"I would like you to do some research."
"Even though I expected better from you."
"Come on, you knew the moment would come."
"You can go out with whoever you want."
"Looks like you were."
"Thank you for bringing my son back to me."
"Someone else will take care of it."
"Would you like to have lunch with me?"
"My mother's earrings."
"My master calls your name, my daughter."
"What do we find there?"
"His plane may be delayed."
"What if you went to get seen?"
"If everything is said, you can leave."
"No, I didn't get it."
"People are running around."
"The truth must be known."
"Maybe he wanted it for me."
"I thought you might like it."
"We'll know when we find it."
"It's harder than you think."
"Lieutenant, contact the captains of these vessels."
"Tell your friend to calm down."
"You know what I want?"

"I have to finish in there."
"Please accept my apologies."
"What are you doing outside?"
"I'll find them a new lawyer."

"We'll take a look."
"It's good to be back."
"The mummy has only one eye."
"How often do you have sex?"
"The bathroom is over there."
"Do you have your lunch in this box?"
"What will you tell him?"
"And you can afford a woman?"
"You have no self-esteem?"
"So you are 'The Jew Hunter'."
"Of course, I'll be right there."
"First the man, then the theme."
"Maybe it was a big dog."
"I was the one who spoke to him."
"Then we moved into this building."
"I waited for you all night."
"I just wanted to be on the show."
"Don't forget to wear white."
"I clean upstairs, you clean downstairs."
"Someone knows more than me."
"I have to take care of this."
"I am a prince honest before God."
"If you say so."
"Did they put you in this state?"
"I was wondering where you'd gone."
"Do me a favor anyway."
"Let me tell you this once."
"I am happy to have a son."
"I hope I have some left."
"There is no America."
"It's getting hotter and hotter."
"I go after 'cup', 'pool' and 'giraffe'."

"We need prisoners to interrogate."
"What you do, I do."
"As you can see, we are protected."
"She thinks she's irresistible."
"It gives you goosebumps, doesn't it?"
"At least, that's what I think."
"They even had business cards."
"I'm telling you it's going to be okay."
"All available droids must be engaged."
"Do you want to talk about this?"
"First the guns, and now this."
"We assume that means yes."
"I saw you on TV."
"Is there another one?"
"I prefer a worm in my stool."
"But I'll tell it, if you want."
"It's time for your nap."
"The house, at the top of the beach."
"Let's go see what's going on."
"That's what the newspapers say."
"I have a convoy arriving tomorrow."
"What do you do at the newspaper at night?"
"Can we talk, please?"
"It must be someone else."
"But I will come and get her myself."
"I think we're rehearsing a shot."
"You are the TV actress."
"We'll talk about it again later."
"I want you to take care of it."
"Let's follow the Mafia trail here."
"What does he plan to do?"
"See if he returns your greeting."
"I thought we were welcome."
"I think she likes me."
"We built a world of our own."
"Someone has to go."
"I'll pick you up in an hour."
"But we'll take him to the castle."
"You ignored the rules of combat."
"Ah, my dear, was the walk nice?"
"What did you bring?"
"No, I don't want to see that."
"That's what I heard."
"What you call a daredevil."
"She will walk when she decides to."
"Maybe I should introduce myself."
"I said it was good."
"You want something to eat, huh?"
"He's the man of my life."
"Maybe I should check everything."
"So you better hurry."
"Like everyone else on this ship."
"Does he know what happened to her?"
"What am I going to look like?"
"Did you admire the view this morning?"
"Do you have to read at the table?"
"Well, you'll see, she's great."
"That was hours ago."
"I think they're hiding something."
"I didn't answer the phone."
"Why are you so nice to me?"
"The colonel orders the personnel to leave."
"What if I can't do it?"
"I'll give you some, old man."
"Was there an egg in there?"
"One man can change the world."
"I love it when you wear that perfume."
"American names mean nothing at all."
"She told me a lot about you."
"I learned it at school."
"That was the dynamic of the group."
"As far as I could."
"You are the head of the Takeda clan."
"I've been gone for a long time."
"Yes, I found the same thing."
"Tell all your friends about me."
"Or the ability to make objects fly."
"And what does he say?"
"Does it happen that dreams come true?"
"I want to see what he looks like."
"I'm going with or without you."
"All new students have one."
"You have to do what I say."
"Colonel, madam tells me to serve you."
"Mom, what are you talking about?"
"What don't you know?"
"It's just that I love you."
"A sound engineer from my studios."
"She has to learn to calm herself down."
"Please repeat it again."
"I guarantee the boss will protect you."
"There is a crowd approaching."
"I'll give you one too."
"You will become Lina's partner."
"You just have to listen."
"You think we don't know?"
"You better get on with it."
"Thanks for letting me know."
"And this is where she will be."
"I'm going to tell you a little secret."
"I asked him the same question."
"But someone else can."
"Do you want me to cut it?"
"He said he came to drink a Coke."
"She has a red handbag."
"I know I betrayed you."
"She has already had nose surgery."
"You're not out of the woods yet."
"Does anyone see us?"
"That's what the newspaper says."
"What if you can't find them?"
"Please let me through."
"It wasn't a click of the tongue."
"A lot of things, actually."
"He knows the powers of the Force."
"This is a gift from me."
"I have already answered this question."
"You don't need medication."
"You looked like you were having fun."
"Go fuck yourself among the Greeks."
"Just pull the trigger."
"It's an honor to know you."
"Add songs and dances to it."
"I got a phone call."
"It's on the bedside table."
"There must be something to it."
"So where could she possibly come from?"
"Nobody knows what we're talking about."
"Santiago's letter was one of them."
"Taste the champagne, miss, it's good."
"That's where Miss Hall comes in."
"It looks like this is the end."
"Do you bet on what happens?"
"I don't need publicity."
"What if reality is me?"
"I watch him do his crossword puzzles."
"Just once in a while."
"But in Geneva, everyone dances."
"Because you betrayed yourself, Captain."
"And we will be young together again."
"And tell him you love him?"
"What if he isn't there?"
"You are stronger than your father."
"Do you believe in crocodiles in the sewers?"
"I believe there is a force controlling you."
"You went further than expected."
"I had more money to eat."
"There must be a way out."
"You better tell the truth."
"I swore to tell the truth."
"I understand exactly how you feel."
"I know what you're going to do."
"Maybe you should get a job."
"I did a bit of two-wheeling."
"I thought you agreed."
"I bet you anything."
"Everyone will realize it."
"Does that mean you forgive me?"
"I was working for Fallon at the time."
"Were you thinking about a financing plan?"
"But I did my best."
"Listen, I have to go."
"I understand that you feel threatened."
"Anyway, thank you very much."
"Can we talk about this another day?"
"To give him a Code Red."
"Please don't shout."
"We'll finish the interview in Maryland."
"I was the one who introduced them."
"I always wanted to know."
"You better not know."
"The decisions will be made by the generals."
"You got what you wanted."
"Children must go to school."
"I'd better take care of it."
"We found common ground."
"You're not equipped for that?"
"You came back because you wanted to."
"Dad, what the hell are you doing?"
"Maybe she knows something."
"And now you're still coding?"
"I'm going to drink a glass of water."
"You should have more confidence in yourself."
"That's what you think."
"What is the access code?"
"I found it in the jungle."
"You know what I'm doing."
"But you've heard about me."
"It was my son's birthday."
"I know, because I loved it."
"You were the one who mentioned it."
"I had a doctor's appointment."
"Our mother just told us."
"He can take care of himself."
"He likes the wind in the trees."
"But before, it didn't bother you."
"Do what I asked you."
"Is there a line for the restrooms?"
"You didn't answer the question."
"Does it really matter to you right now?"
"I will stay with you all the time."
"I just want human warmth."
"Go see what happened."
"I know people like you."
"This is your father's business."
"I'll take care of it, if I can."
"I would never have thought of that."
"You repeat to yourself what you know."
"You should have paid it on time."
"You ended the war."
"I really need a friend."
"Graves should have mentioned both of our names."

"Do you have love in you?"
"But one of you must know."
"The promise of a man stuck here."
"I don't want to anymore, that's all."
"We take care of each other."
"See you the day after tomorrow at the office."
"I'm going to give you a good lesson."

"Take me to the forward command post."
"You don't think in four dimensions."
"Did you talk to Tania for me?"
"You keep telling yourself this without believing it."
"It makes your smile even more beautiful."
"I tried to see five of them."
"Maybe he did."
"I'm sure it will pass."
"Is this the bathroom?"
"You know I trust you."
"It must be what I want."
"He blocked it with something."
"I can't, you know that."
"I am a friend of your husband."
"It's over between her and me."
"I think we'll find out."
"I don't remember very well."
"Have you never had dreams?"
"Yeah, he's a friend of mine."
"Let's say he comes from outside."
"He went to the other side."
"I think that's it."
"We showed you America."
"I received a letter from Annabelle."
"Come on, guys, I'll buy you a drink."
"I'm coming for a ride with you."
"It is within the realm of possibility."
"We spent the afternoon together."

"What were you doing before?"
"Of course I want to."
"But isn't it just about flowers?"
"This is only part of it."
"And you asked his opinion?"
"You will be the first one in the tunnel."
"Do you want me to tell you, Mr."
"I wonder if she's happy."
"That's what she meant."
"Are you sure this is it?"
"It's the end of the season."
"You are the mother of my children."
"You never meant to."
"Do you think I have a chance?"
"It feels good to say it."
"That was a while ago."
"She aimed at a mailbox."
"Looking for your dream home?"

"Can we talk about this later?"
"She is my brother's wife."
"You stepped on me once."
"When I get out, I'll come see you."
"Am I part of it?"

"Tell us what it is."
"Until it calms down."
"That's all I'm good at."
"I saw what they do."
"It takes time to get used to it."
"I could eat it every day."
"Anyway, we're leaving here."
"How do you think I feel?"
"The Number must remain on its guard."
"I thought I could teach."
"I think you should go."
"I'll tell you where they are."
"Is this the young lady in question?"
"But I'll tell you a secret."
"You've got your work cut out for you."
"His plane landed in the USA."
"It's up to us to apologize."
"I came on my own."
"Here, do we not know defeats?"
"I'll throw you into the water."
"Do you want a cold one, man?"
"Ask him if it's his movie."
"We bring the doctor to cover us."
"Do you have someone to talk to?"
"Everything seems in order to me."
"You think I don't know?"
"This is what you ordered."
"As if you never left."
"Only at the beginning of love stories."
"The Beverly Hotel, please."
"It happened to me too."
"Maybe we should take some notes."
"I have to go see my mother."
"He says he wants to talk to you."
"Do you think you're more important than me?"
"I told you I'd be back."
"Go make some money, my friend."
"Let's see what they have to say."
"You are the best lawyer in the world."
"Where will you spend your honeymoon?"
"He discovered her for this film."
"It's my mother's specialty."
"He's charming, isn't he?"
"I saw your friend from the trains."
"What could this possibly be used for?"
"It's stronger than you, huh?"
"I want one with lightning bolts."
"You need to take him to the hospital."
"So that's all that matters."
"This is the cross I bear."
"Do we agree?"
"There are forms to fill out."
"No, it hasn't arrived yet."
"I can go if you want."
"Do you see how nice the uncle is?"
"So what happens now?"
"I understand what you did."
"How could you let her go?"
"What is the reason for your call?"
"Is that what you wanted to know?"
"I have friends waiting for me."
"I have never seen it before."
"What did you do with these plans?"
"I'll take a look at it."
"There's another one from our group."
"I know how to cheer you up."
"There is still a lot of work to be done."
"And above all, find out who he works for."
"It reminds me of two friends."
"Where did they put the children?"
"I'll try to remember it."
"I just understood the meaning of it."
"There must be a place."
"Because it shouldn't exist."
"We'll see how you like it."
"Can I tell you something?"
"Come on, I'll make you something to eat."
"I must say I am intrigued."
"I wanted you to feel better."
"I still have a little time."
"Under the noses of the intelligence services?"
"Let me ask you something."
"This was your plan all along."
"These people know who you really are."
"Can I sit next to you?"
"I don't think we should."
"We have a lot of catching up to do."
"Was the press there?"
"You're going to start wearing a headscarf."
"What size levels do you need?"
"Audrey takes care of these things."
"He goes towards the children's room."
"To make the world a little better."
"I think I heard a crack."
"Are you sure it's him?"
"You brought her, you sting her."
"I can change that, if you want."
"Is that all you do?"
"I'm the one to blame."
"What you do is very important."
"Can I ask you a personal question?"
"What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
"But I have to get over this, right?"
"That's what we're told."
"Mr. Bentley, you must have known Lawrence well."
"This is where I should be."
"Tell yourself it's a hobby."
"Do what you do best."
"Do what you do best."
"Make sure he does."
"Are you doing anything right now?"
"It's good to see you too."
"We have something to ask you."
"Actually, there is one."
"You found it."
"I'm behind you one hundred percent."
"Do you know who's on the phone?"
"This is all advertising."
"I know a lot about it, you know."
"Ask him if he feels the pressure."
"I've done it twice already."
"Are you interested in what I say?"
"I need to go freshen up."
"Is this your father's car?"
"I want to find it good."
"What if there was nothing?"
"I have a message from your father."
"Did you bring Baby back with you?"
"This is what's left of it."
"The witness may answer the question."
"As you see, we are free."
"It's the big night for you."
"Now I know who you really are."
"I have to leave it open when I receive."
"It puts immortality out of reach."
"They just obeyed an order."
"Good episode to all."
"It's the first door on the left."
"One day we will have to talk."
"They must leave the battlefield."
"It needs to be brought back and studied."
"You'll know it when you see it."
"It was my mother's first name."
"How do you know she'll be there?"
"What am I going to take?"
"There's someone on it."
"Look what you did to me."
"So who can you trust?"
"But he is not the same anymore."
"The best pirate I've ever seen."
"It must provide him with oxygen."
"What do you mean?"
"The full moon is in two days."
"May I continue, please?"
"I had a project in mind."
"What would you have wanted me to do?"
"He's talking to you."
"The Führer will come to the premiere."
"People don't believe in heroes anymore."
"What would it do to him?"
"Isn't that what you do?"
"What would you have said?"
"Do you want me to introduce you to him?"
"I have a workshop in the garage."
"The memory of what they were doing."
"You are expected to use your judgment."
"What do you say about it?"
"It's a real pack of wolves."
"It's between my daughter and me."
"Can't you afford one?"
"I had a very nice evening."
"No, I understand. He's super cool."
"What's going on, buddy?"
"Despite the way it turned out?"
"Call me if you have any news."
"It is a privilege to meet you."
"What did Dawson say about this?"
"So what is it really about?"
"It's not the same at all."
"He succeeded thanks to the internet."
"Let me take you home."
"If you control McNamara, you control Kennedy."
"There are many more."
"Maybe he needs money."
"Just when my engine was starting to warm up."
"There's mail for you."
"And I have work to do."
"I knew she had been engaged."
"There may be side effects."
"The CIA has always known about their existence."
"How did you get to this point?"
"She couldn't do that."
"Don't want to park here?"
"He said he would be back soon."
"That's it, once a year."
"Maybe you'll go to 'The Tavern'."
"Did you have to do it on foot?"
"I only told the truth."
"All you're missing is the story."
"When do I start to get used to it?"
"What do you want to eat?"
"I think we did it."
"This is the captain speaking to you."
"We've heard a lot about you."
"Everyone understand the plan?"
"We had a delivery for you."
"I was in the bathroom."
"Isn't that what you wanted?"
"I want to know more about him."
"What did you do?"
"The salesman was going to give him a mole."
"It's your turn to go to bed."
"It's such a safe feeling."
"So, how was your day?"
"You're the only one who thinks that."
"But it's up to you."
"What are you looking for, Pam?"
"It took me three months to receive it."
"I've thought about all this carefully."
"Is there a phone around here?"
"Stay alert on the dashboard."
"And what will you look like?"
"I am better equipped to win."
"I didn't see anything else."
"He will ask you if you are progressing."
"I'm glad we came."
"Tony T. had another son, Vincent."
"You'll be the one on duty."
"But fate decided otherwise."
"He came two or three times."
"Just before we close the kitchen."
"As for the Williams, their income is secret."
"I knew exactly what I was doing."
"That's what they said."
"I just wanted to tell you about my dream."
"You didn't expect that?"
"I'll call you when it's done."
"What are these men doing in my base?"
"You meet people like me there."
"They are beautiful, aren't they?"
"Have you confirmed this with the locals?"
"Tell me what you found."
"What was in the bag?"
"I appoint you head of the music department."
"I'll go make you some coffee."
"This is where we are."
"I thought we were going to Morocco."
"I take care of the accounts with them."
"You got what you paid for."
"No, you didn't say that."
"This is the sound of my voice."
"And you, how did it go?"
"I know what I mean."
"The clerk will read the verdict."
"You had a car accident."
"Is something missing?"
"I started seeing things."
"There are probably other weirdos here."
"Maybe we pushed him."
"I'm sure you are."
"I haven't even started yet."
"I have more experience than you."
"It just so happens to be me."
"It's been in the garage for three years."
"It's good to hear your voice."
"The Child Protection Center."
"Please, not so fast."
"He seemed delighted to be rid of it."
"You already know what they say."
"Yes, I guess that's true."
"Have we found each other, you and I?"
"My doors are no longer closed to you."
"There's a lunch to be won."
"He offers me to live with him."
"Are you sure about this?"
"Sorry for inviting you."
"Emerging from a half-erased dream."
"It's your mother's birthday."
"And the truth is on your side."
"What should I do?"
"What am I supposed to do with this?"
"And swim to shore."
"It was nice talking to you."
"I kept calling."
"Is there a doctor around here?"
"Thank everyone for me."
"I remember every one of your laughs."
"I was lucky."
"What are you doing in a place like this?"
"I have some very, very good news."
"A job I gave you."
"Or at least not until tomorrow night."
"We have to stay outside until dawn."
"Do you know what happened to me?"
"This is the last time, friend."
"Who do we send it to first?"
"I'm comfortable with you."
"He just entered the picture."
"I'm often on call at night."
"We found this in your office."
"What movies have you seen me in?"
"But you have to ask nicely for things."
"We have our whole lives ahead of us."
"I am the captain of this ship."
"You got pregnant on the island."
"Someone is coming."
"He knew what was going to happen."
"I've always been on your side."
"What happened to this man?"
"So what do you decide?"
"No, I have never been married."
"Okay, we're almost there."
"You mean at what exact moment?"
"I want to talk to him about his property."
"Even accountants have imagination."
"I got you half price."
"I've heard a lot about you."
"What happened to you there?"
"No, but it's of the same order."
"I want peace, and anonymity."
"I'm going to hug you."
"That's all I did."
"Are you sure he's here?"
"You need to eat before you go home."
"It's time to look for a psychiatrist."
"I told you to look at me."
"It would be easier without the bra."
"It's my life, not yours."
"Captain, submarine on the port bow."
"When should I have noticed?"
"Seriously, what's going on?"
"It suddenly stopped."
"Is it time to talk about it?"
"How did you know where we were?"
"You see what I mean?"
"Will you find someone who loves you like I do?"
"For some, she even has two."
"So you'll have to wake him up."
"You made that clear to me."
"Yeah, my mother-in-law loves this stuff."
"Can I know what it is?"
"May joy live in us forever."
"Is that all I get?"
"It's kind of a special occasion."
"Hey, what is it?"
"I know what you've been through."
"It's almost tea time."
"Luckily, I'm not one of them."
"I want to have children with you."
"We'll see you in action."
"I went to South Dakota."
"There's like a leak."
"I know you like it very much."
"Did you think he wouldn't tell me anything?"
"I've seen one like this before."
"I don't think it's him."
"That's what my father thought."
"I was never told that."
"He never told you?"
"I did some research on you."
"I have a model of his handwriting."
"As if that meant anything."
"These are Cher's panties."
"You've crossed over to the other side."
"Do we have the same principles as them?"
"What are you two doing here?"
"I saw this on TV."
"I thought you were gone."
"Do you know what you're doing, Ali?"
"I found this in the Reserve."
"Respect for elders builds character."
"Are you sleeping with him?"
"I wish he was here."
"What triggered it?"
"Until it's over."
"How much you've grown."
"The first flight leaving Germany."
"I thought we understood each other."
"I was in the ice cream aisle."
"That's what Dad would have wanted."
"This is what you have to understand."
"I didn't want anyone to know."
"It was probably to play on diversity."
"Are you sure this will work?"
"I thought you weren't listening."
"How dare you say such a thing?"
"My friend says you are a stallion."
"You knew him, didn't you?"
"I had a high opinion of Bell."
"Excuse me, I'll be right back."
"Do you understand what that means?"
"I saw what I wanted."
"I hope it's worth it."
"You don't want to talk to me about it?"
"With you, we're like kids."
"Get everyone on board."
"The queen of bitches in the universe."
"You think you're above everything."
"I totally agree with you."
"And one day earlier in August."
"It's time to end this."
"I'll take you to the hospital."
"Plus, he has a sexy voice."
"Have you at least talked to him about it?"
"Our intelligence had Oswald in its files."
"What's this boat thing about?"
"This question was just a question."
"I saw this person too."
"Where are your mom and dad?"
"I could, but I don't want to."
"She didn't know what she was doing."
"I'm so glad you're here."
"I thought it was you."
"Do you know what's in it?"
"What was in it?"
"It's just around the corner."
"We are made for each other."
"We are made for each other."
"We are made for each other."
"I've never seen her like this."
"Where did you get it?"
"That's why I love him."
"Who do I have the honor of speaking to?"
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"There's something in the air."
"It was the year everything changed."
"Where did I put it?"
"No, you didn't tell me."
"It had to happen one day or another."
"That's where I saw him."
"That's what we call it."
"When was the last time you saw her?"
"I'm going to be late for school."
"Is it money you want?"
"That's how I like it."
"We're lucky to have him."
"Did he tell you that?"
"I think I'll go to bed."
"This is where you come in."
"That's where you come in."
"I'd better go."
"Get out of the car, please."
"I'll see if the coast is clear."
"What the hell got into you?"
"But what happened to you?"
"But what got into you?"
"What did they tell you?"
"What did they tell you?"
"I wanted to tell you that I love you."
"Think about what I told you."
"Think about what I told you."
"What do you think about it?"
"What does he have to do with it?"
"I told you it was over."
"Is there anyone in there?"
"Is that what they told you?"
"What's in this box?"
"Is that what you were told?"
"What's in it for your service?"
"Do you have what I asked you for?"
"I didn't ask you to come."
"She's lucky to have you."
"She's lucky to have you."
"You don't need to explain yourself."
"He's lucky to have you."
"I know what he did to you."
"How long will it take?"
"What do you have in there?"
"Do you have everything you need?"
"I never said anything like that."
"I will tell you everything I know."
"I'll tell you anything you want."
"Just a touch and I see things."
"What can I get you?"
"It didn't go as planned."
"I apologize for earlier."
"It's time to go to bed."
"It's time to go to bed."
"It's time to move on."
"I'll take a look at it."
"It's time to go to bed."
"Where did you get that from?"
"A glass of water, please."
"What else do you want?"
"You have nothing else to do?"
"I only have eyes for you."
"How does it feel to be a hero?"
"What else did he tell you?"
"I'll take a look at it."
"You take me for someone else."
"What else do you want me to do?"
"What do we do with her?"
"What's special about it?"
"What am I supposed to do?"
"What am I supposed to do?"
"What am I supposed to do?"
"What am I supposed to do?"
"What are we supposed to do?"
"What are we supposed to do?"
"I wanted to apologize for the other day."
"Can I sit next to you?"
"Did you tell him you loved him?"
"I told you I loved you."
"You told me you loved me."
"I can't remember."
"I know what you're trying to do."
"I know what you're trying to do."
"I know what you're trying to do."
"What are you trying to do?"
"What are you trying to do?"
"What are you trying to do?"
"What are you trying to say?"
"What are you trying to say?"
"I want you to be proud of me."
"I'm glad you could come."
"I'm glad you could come."
"I'm glad you could come."
"I have to go to the bathroom."
"I want you to stay here with me."
"I'm glad you did."
"I'm glad you did."
"My feelings for you haven't changed."
"No, I didn't sleep with him."
"I'm going to ask you a series of questions."
"What did you bring me?"
"I think I owe you an apology."
"I think I owe you an apology."
"Do you want me to tell you the truth?"
"Is that what you call it?"
"What brings you here?"
"What brings you here?"
"What was I supposed to do?"
"What was I supposed to do?"
"What was I supposed to do?"
"Do you want to know what I think about it?"
"Want to know what I think?"
"I have a little something for you."
"How did you know I was here?"
"I need to tell you something."
"That's what I'm trying to say."
"That's exactly what I did."
"I heard what happened."
"I thought you might like it."
"And you know what I did?"
"My mouth is watering."
"I'm lucky to have you."
"But that's all I have."
"That's what I've always done."
"This is exactly what I needed."
"This is exactly what I needed."

"I just need more time."
"I did what I did."
"That's exactly what I was going to say."
"I need to go to the bathroom."
"Yeah, that's what I said."
"I thought you should know."
"But what do I know about it?"
"That's what I've always said."
"I saw your picture in the newspaper."
"I saw your picture in the newspaper."
"Did you see what I did?"
"Did you see what I did?"
"I hope you had a good trip."
"I forgot what I was going to say."
"I told you I was fine."
"I need to take my mind off things."
"Is that something I said?"
"I need a glass of water."
"I have everything you need."
"I need to ask you some questions."
"Did I say something?"
"I have never seen anything so beautiful."

"What are you going to do with it?"
"I think I'm in love with you."
"I think I'm in love with you."
"It's a pleasure to meet you."
"Are you asking me?"
"Do you remember what I said?"
"That's what it seemed to me."
"It is a pleasure to deal with you."
"What is that supposed to say?"
"I will give you everything I have."
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"My parents live across the street from us."
"That's where we met."
"I told you everything would be fine."
"If you want me to leave, say so."
"This place gives me goosebumps."
"This place gives me goosebumps."
"How could you do such a thing?"
"You have to get me out of here."
"Don't you want me to come with you?"
"You haven't changed a bit."
"That's the impression I got."
"There is food in the fridge."
"Is that the best you can do?"
"Is that the best you can do?"
"It's the least you can do."
"I hope it was worth it."
"Do you want me to draw you a picture?"
"I want you to tell me the truth."
"I have more important things to do."
"The Earth is a huge treasure island."
"This is a flash of the Breath of Freedom."
"I need you to come with me."
"I need you to come with me."
"I don't think we know each other."
"I have something that might interest you."
"I'll only ask you once."
"May I ask you a question?"
"A little of this, a little of that."
"Think about all we've accomplished."
"Do you realize what you just did?"
"Leave me a message and I'll call you back."
"Hot in Cleveland is recorded in front of an audience."
"There are three flowers in a vase."

"You have to do me a favor."
"This is the story of the last Babylon station."
"My wife and daughter were kidnapped."
"What's going on with you?"
"What did you do to them?"
"I did what you said."
"I did what you said."
"What should I do with it?"
"But I know what I saw."
"What could that mean?"
"What do we do with them?"
"I ask you this as a friend."
"I have to go home."
"What's out there?"
"What brought you here?"
"What brought you here?"
"She did this to me."
"Is that what you wanted to tell me?"
"Is that what you wanted to tell me?"
"What's that doing there?"
"I want you to come home."
"I learned what had happened."
"I have a million things to do."
"There is a way to find out."
"What's behind that door?"
"In the footsteps of God, he must advance."
"I'm glad to see you too."
"I have something important to tell you."
"What did I do again?"
"I have a lot of things to do."
"Is that why you came?"
"Is that why you came?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Nobody knows what happened."
"What don't you like?"
"You took the words right out of my mouth."
"You took the words right out of my mouth."
"You took the words right out of my mouth."

"Please do it for me."
"Come on, I have something to show you."
"I don't think it's him."
"There is something I am missing."
"So what did you do?"
"I was told you were here."
"I can't talk about that now."
"Did you do all this?"
"I hope you are proud of yourself."
"That's how I love you."
"I said I would think about it."
"Hey, easy, what's going on?"
"No, it's up to me to do it."
"I know what you told me."
"I know what you told me."
"That's what I told you."
"Do I look like it?"

"Did you see what he did?"
"Did you see what he did?"
"Is that what you want to tell me?"
"Do you remember what we said?"
"I've never heard anything like it."
"We received reports of gunshots."
"But there is a price to pay."
"I have a few more questions for you."
"You know what that reminds me of?"
"You have the right to say nothing."
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"What are you doing here?"
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"It's not just about you."
"What do you want exactly?"
"I was told you were here."

"That's all we have left."
"I must learn to be one of them."
"It was the best time of my life."
"It's a pleasure working with you."
"This is where it happened."
"What are you going to do with it?"
"Did you understand what I said?"
"Did you understand what I said?"
"What did I teach you?"
"I'm doing something."
"I want to know what's going on here."
"I would have gone with you all the way."
"Tell him what I told you."
"And when you're right, you're right."
"I wish you all the happiness in the world."
"Its plants, its rivers, its roads, its inhabitants."
"We have everything we need."
"Do you want me to go with you?"
"I want everyone to know this."
"What's wrong with your neck?"
"What did you just do?"
"I know what you did to him."
"Take all the time you need."
"Take all the time you need."

"I know I can count on you."
"This is what I've always dreamed of."
"I'll see what's going on."
"What's going on down there?"
"It was my idea."
"You know how spies are."
"What do they have in common?"
"And what should I do?"
"What do you care what I do with it?"
"I never intended to."
"I was told he was here."
"What would I do without you?"
"Even the wisest cannot say."
"Do you see what you're making me do?"
"He's the one who shot me."
"Do you want me to tell you something?"
"What are you laughing at?"
"It's time to put an end to this."
"That's what I call it."
"What am I supposed to say?"
"Don't you have anything else to do?"
"What did she do now?"
"What are we doing tonight?"
"I thought he would never leave."
"I told everyone."
"I dreamed about you last night."
"What is this thing?"
"You did this to me."
"You did this to me."
"I don't think he will."
"What can I tell you?"
"What are you going to do then?"
"That's all there was to it."
"What else does it say?"
"I'm the one who gives the orders here."
"I dreamed of seeing the kings of old."
"I know what I look like."
"Can I say something?"
"You still love him, don't you?"
"You didn't answer my calls."
"Who is that man in the corner?"
"I am not what you think."
"I am not what you think."
"So what should I do?"
"That's where I found it."
"I would love to hold him one last time."
"Are you sure you don't want to come?"
"That's why he's here."
"What do you have to say?"
"What do you have to say?"
"We were lucky with him."
"Do you think this is a good idea?"
"Is this how you apologize?"
"There is one who can unite them."
"What was he doing there?"
"I'll ask you again."
"What did she give you?"
"Isn't that what you wanted?"
"Isn't that what you wanted?"
"That's all we found."
"What's so special about her?"
"Where are you going?"
"What did you tell him?"
"What did you say to him?"
"Can you tell me what it is?"
"What did you give him?"
"I hope you enjoyed the music."
"I put it there."
"Mom, I have something to tell you."
"You got everything you wanted."
"Because that's what I want."
"The force has left the world of men."
"It's you I want to talk to."
"I've never heard of you."
"What is not true?"
"What could I have done?"
"What do you have against me?"
"That's what they call me."
"Both, as often as possible."
"What do you want to show me?"
"You are indeed your father's son."
"I'm the one who brought him here."
"Do you know what I told him?"
"They are made for each other."
"There is something for everyone."
"Not from what I've seen."
"How did it feel?"
"And what do I gain from it?"
"You heard what she said."
"Driving licence and registration card, please."
"And one and two and three and four."
"Come on, I have something to show you."
"Is everyone here?"
"I can't tell you now."
"That's how it works, right?"
"I hope you don't mind."
"I hope you don't mind."
"What can happen to us in the Shire?"
"I told you not to come."
"Please don't say that."
"So what brings you here?"
"This is what I want you to do."
"And what did I do?"
"Did you do well at school?"
"What's gotten into you?"
"Did you tell him I was here?"
"I could say the same about you."
"What really makes a man?"
"I'm glad to hear you say that."
"It just didn't work."
"There is a reason for all this."
"Do you want me to take you home?"
"You may have come to explain this to me."
"No, this is not the right time."
"Because I didn't."
"Hey, what's going on?"
"Hey, what's going on?"
"You have nothing else to say?"
"When was the last time you ate?"
"You have to tell me what's going on."
"Do you know how much I love you?"
"I want to introduce you to a friend of mine."
"I wish it had been different."
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"I would have loved to hold him one last time."
"I'll tell you what I want."
"I'll tell you what I want."
"There is a lot of work to be done."
"What exactly did he say?"
"What brings you to town?"
"He is waiting to take him across the sea."
"It will depend on how you come back."
"You have to tell him how you feel."
"We had the first one, but the second one?"
"I'm glad to see you too."
"Don't you think it's time?"
"You think I haven't tried?"
"What do we know about him?"
"Who put this idea into your head?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"He has giants fighting over him."
"That's very kind of you to say that."
"What is that over there?"
"If they want war, they will have it."
"I didn't start it."
"I keep telling you."
"You will have to be whole for many years."
"I did what I was asked."
"I said everything I knew."
"What's going on between you two?"
"No, it's not the same thing."
"Can someone tell me what's going on?"
"You can have whatever you want."
"What am I supposed to do?"
"Would you mind doing something for me?"
"There must be something that can be done."
"That's all we ask of you."
"They're lucky to have you."
"We're glad you found us."
"You lived your life for the king."
"I will say what I have to say."
"This is about you."
"I hope it was worth it."
"Are you sure about what you're doing?"
"Truth comes from the mouths of babes."
"I appreciate everything you have done."
"I wonder what that means."
"And what do I do with it?"
"I want to know what he said."
"Not everyone is like you."
"I know what they did to you."
"That's exactly what she said."
"Are you saying that to me?"
"That's how I started."
"Drew, you're one of us."
"Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you."
"And I want you to come with me."
"It feels good to be back."
"I was thinking about you."
"What do you know about him?"
"What do you know about him?"
"How could he do this to me?"
"She was here a minute ago."
"You can ask me whatever you want."
"He left an hour ago."
"Do you want to know what I did?"
"And what are you doing here?"
"Can you give me a hand?"
"Can I talk to you, please?"
"What makes you think so?"
"He asked me to give this to you."
"What did he tell me?"
"Oh my God, what happened?"
"What is it supposed to be?"
"I told you what I wanted."
"It's the least he can do."
"Maybe I wasn't clear."
"This is exactly what I'm talking about."
"What makes us lucky?"
"Those who come from Heaven do not see."
"What makes you think that?"
"So what does that mean?"
"I need to go to the hospital."
"Isn't that how they say it?"
"And that's what we're going to do."
"But what can we do?"
"I've read a lot about you."
"How long have you been here?"
"This is the best I can do."
"What are you doing around here?"
"He did it, didn't he?"
"That's how it is and that's all."
"This is the first time this has happened."
"I might have something for you."
"I wonder what happened."
"Did you hear what she said?"
"And me, what do I do?"
"Was it worth it?"
"Don't tell me what to do."
"It's just you and me."
"This is where our paths separate."
"Yeah, that's what he said."
"You can have whatever you want."
"I have a lot of things to tell you."
"No idea what that means."
"That's what I was thinking too."
"Listen, I have something to tell you."
"You're lucky to have him."
"You're lucky to have him."
"You only do what you want."
"You really love him, don't you?"
"That's why you love me."
"I told myself I could overcome anything."
"Please don't go."
"Everything I said is true."
"Because that's what I do."
"This is how it should be."
"I know what you're going to tell me."
"What's in the trunk?"
"What do you think of him?"
"That's exactly what I mean."
"I wonder what it could be."
"What really happened?"
"That's all I want to do."
"But what am I doing here?"
"What are we going to do here?"
"I forgot what I wanted to say."
"That's what everyone does."
"Can I talk to you, please?"
"I guess I owe you an apology."
"What can we do?"
"That's what I'm paid for."
"This is what I wanted to show you."
"We will do everything we can."
"I never meant for this to happen."
"Do you know what you just did?"
"What did he tell you?"
"This is what he always wanted."
"That's all I remember."
"No one has ever called me that."
"What are you doing exactly?"
"I'm sure it's over there."
"They completed their growth during the journey."
"Is that why you left?"
"Is that why you left?"
"That's all that happened."
"You want to tell me what's going on?"
"Yes, that's what I thought."
"One at a time, please."
"Is this how it's going to be?"
"What exactly is going on?"
"I'm sure you know something."
"I hope it won't be long."
"There is a way around it."
"I have to get out of here."
"That's what they call it."
"Do you have everything you need?"
"Do you have everything you need?"
"We will need the details of each column."
"Did she tell you that?"
"What did they do to me?"
"How did you know I was here?"
"My mother did it."
"I didn't do anything, I swear."
"Is that what you call it?"
"Is that what you call it?"
"Beware of what comes from above."
"I'm asking you."
"There is one thing that escapes me."
"You should ask him."
"I have to show you something."
"It's what I do best."
"You did what you could."
"I know exactly what you mean."
"I'll take care of it, I'll take care of it."
"What happened yesterday?"
"I'm sure we can work something out."
"That's what I'm wondering."
"We have to look on the bright side."
"And you know what happened?"
"This is what we are trying to find out."
"This is what we are trying to find out."
"I didn't think they would."
"All right, here's what we're going to do."
"This is the best day of my life."
"I only met him once."
"What could have happened?"
"What were you doing in there?"
"That's what you told me."
"Tell me what's in it."
"You seem to get along well."
"It was a pleasure talking to you."
"You look great to me."
"Give me diamonds and make me disappear."
"I think I'll go home."
"You swore to make Spider-Man pay."
"What did you do, Bobby?"
"What can I say to him?"
"I knew there was something up."
"He was able to bring the Ring here."
"I wanted to apologize for the other night."
"How did you know it was me?"
"I decided not to go."
"Where did you find it?"
"Please make yourself at home."
"Let's see if you don't have any critters."
"I'll go take a look."
"Of course I remember you."
"He seems to like you."
"A man must have principles."
"Six years pass in the blink of an eye."
"But what is he doing there?"
"This is exactly what is happening to us."
"May I examine what is in your bag?"
"No, I don't want you to leave."
"He kicked me."
"What are you trying to do?"
"That's all we can do."
"Were you the one who called the police?"
"What makes you say that?"
"What makes you say that?"
"I want you to do me a favor."
"What are you doing with her?"
"A truly interesting phenomenon from a biological point of view."
"That's all you need."
"I have so much to tell you."
"What are you doing to me?"
"That's all I needed."
"Don't believe everything you read."
"You have to listen to what she tells you."
"What do you have to do?"
"Let's see what he's got."
"Have you ever been treated in the county?"
"He's lucky to have you."
"No phone calls without his consent."
"That's what people do, right?"
"I have just what you need."
"You could have told me earlier."
"But you know that, don't you?"
"I'm learning to trust my body."
"That's all I heard."
"How dare you speak to me in that tone?"
"That's why I like you."
"We have a lot to tell each other."
"You were overcome with emotion."
"What exactly do you mean?"
"How many times have I told you?"
"You made all this up in your head."
"I haven't stopped calling you."
"I came to take you home."
"Did he tell you that?"
"We'll get along fine if you relax."
"Is that what you want to talk about?"
"Do you think I'm going to tell you?"
"How much do you pay me to do your job?"
"Are you sure about what you're doing?"
"No, it's not about that."
"And you, what do you have?"
"You know what would make you feel better?"
"She is not in her normal state."
"I swear I didn't do anything."
"Times are tough for everyone."
"This is exactly what you need."
"Maybe they're looking for us."
"You would know, if you had been trained."
"We have to trust him."
"You must have seen this on TV."
"That he was good, that he was wise?"
"Does this mean anything to you?"
"He was the one who came to see me."
"I saw what you did."
"Is that all you can say?"
"Isn't that what you do?"
"Is this a good idea?"
"Can I get you something to drink?"
"You taught me that."
"I'll get you some water."
"That's what I was told."
"Is that all you found?"
"I'll tell you what it is."
"He arrived two days ago."
"And I know what you're up to too."
"That's what I was getting at."
"I'll tell you what you want to know."
"My friends are toys that I make."
"I told him not to resist."
"That's one way of looking at it."
"They tell us what the Force wants."
"I'm going to ask you one last time."
"I can take care of myself."
"What does that make you?"
"Is there a role for me?"
"And what did they say?"
"And what is this?"
"Your mother would have wanted you to hold on."
"I'll tell you what it means."
"I think it's for the best."
"Few people can afford this quality."
"I have nowhere else to go."
"I gave you what you wanted."
"Do you remember when we met?"
"What can I do for you?"
"I knew we could count on you."
"I hope it's worth it."
"I want to see the effect on a human."
"This is a step in the right direction."
"Tell her she needs to eat."
"Tell me what happened."
"I thought it would do me good."
"What don't you like?"
"But sooner or later, you have to wake up."
"I did what you said."
"I have to get that bullet out of you."
"When will it stop?"
"It's time to go to the bathroom."
"But it's a long-term project."
"I am being chased by a psychopathic military commander."
"Not a word to anyone."
"Thanks to you, we have the last piece."
"All right, what's this strategy thing?"
"But what are you going to do?"
"No, there's no one else."
"My head is a little dizzy."
"You don't have to answer that."
"There is no war here."
"So what's the matter?"
"What did she do to him?"
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
"How do I know if I can trust you?"
"What are we doing here?"
"And what did it give?"
"What's in this package?"
"What did you do to us?"
"No, you have your nose in the screen."
"I'm telling you what I saw."
"Tell me, what is it?"
"If I do, I will be one of them."
"That's why I came back."
"That's why I came back."
"What are you doing with him?"
"That's what I always thought."
"I know what he means to you."
"I think there is something else."
"But that's worth more than my life."
"You did well to come see me."
"A little of this, a little of that."
"We slide, one to the right, one to the left."
"I saw them yesterday in the harbor."
"I guess you want to take up the sword again."
"But what happened to you?"
"I told you what I knew."
"He did what he had to do."
"There is a lion on campus."
"It's the middle of the night."
"It's to see you better, my child."
"The Babylon Project was a dream come true."
"I don't take this lightly."
"Are you telling me?"
"It's time to take action."
"That's why he left."
"It only preserves the balance of life."
"I just have a few questions for you."
"I only saw her once."
"I thought we were telling each other the truth."
"He told me to give this to you."
"I hope you found your refuge."
"I know what you have in mind."
"I told him not to come."
"They constantly feel the presence of the Ring."
"Because that's what's happening."
"Dragon, we turn left and go back."
"You are my only connection to the world."
"I have what you asked for."
"It's only you who matters."
"They left an hour ago."
"Is that why you came back?"
"So what are we doing here?"
"No, you're not there at all."
"Your faith in your friends is your own."
"Splash water on your face."
"All the prisoners on the ground, lying flat on their stomachs."
"But what are you talking about?"
"What did you give me?"
"What did you give me?"
"Do you know who I am?"
"But what's wrong with you all?"
"Shall I go with you in your ship?"
"I did nothing of the sort."
"He's the one you need to talk to."
"Did you tie these knots?"
"What in heaven's name have you done?"
"I'd like to take a look at it."
"A gift from the governor of Sicily, lord."
"Did she do this to you?"
"I thought it was you."
"We have full reports on their movements."
"And what are you going to do?"
"I swear it's the truth."
"Is that all you're going to say?"
"It reminds me of what's in store for us here."
"I only saw him twice."
"You, what are you doing here?"
"What are you doing here?"
"I slept with someone else."
"Tiny organisms present in every living cell."
"What are you looking at?"
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"I think you did it on purpose."
"I could use a hand."
"You are the only one who can do it."
"The bonus would allow them to buy their parts."
"What's on his mind?"
"They have the largest fleet in the world."
"I need time to think about it."
"I climbed every hill to find you."
"I didn't think you would."
"Do you know anything about this?"
"I heard what you said."
"What's gotten into him?"
"I think we've seen enough."
"That's how I feel."
"Call me back as soon as you get this message."
"I'm entitled to a phone call."
"Stay close to me, you will be safe."
"I need you for the harvest."
"Can we go now?"
"All I have is this."
"And what did she do?"
"To what do I owe the honor?"
"We will find you what you are looking for."
"The queen orders that her maid accompany you."
"Thank you for what you are trying to do."
"What happened that night?"
"I heard you were looking for me."
"I didn't ask your opinion."
"We take care of each other."
"What do you know, Capone?"
"On a normal day, we would have plenty of time."
"Not in the way you mean it."
"You look like you need it."
"I think I have something they will like."
"I bought the Senate behind his back."
"That's what I'm talking to you about."
"It had nothing to do with you."
"That's what I was trying to say."
"I told you, I'm fine."
"You knew exactly what you were doing."
"It's you I want to talk to."
"But what got into me?"
"What are you trying to say?"
"We have so much to say to each other."
"Don't you believe what you see?"
"I'll give them a hand."
"That's what I was trying to do."
"I gave everything I had."
"You know you can trust me."
"There are no soldiers here."
"I did everything he wanted."
"I did what you asked."
"Do you believe in the queen's idea?"
"But what did he do?"
"I came as soon as I heard."
"Mom, what's going on?"
"She told me she loved me."
"I'll tell Mom not to sell you."
"What do you know about her?"
"Words are stones in my heart."
"I tried to call you several times."
"With time and practice, you will understand."
"I have so many questions to ask you."
"You should be congratulated on that."
"I bought a wet nurse for him yesterday."
"Are you asking me that?"
"Is that what you like, Captain?"
"Are there others like you?"
"What do you have against him?"
"I just came to say goodbye."
"No, that's not what I'm saying."
"I meant everything I said."
"I haven't heard from him."
"He sees things before they happen."
"How long has it been since you saw him?"
"Tell them everything that happened."
"A word before the execution of the sentence?"
"What did she mean?"
"Isn't that what you want?"
"The more the better."
"She looked me straight in the eyes."
"There are mines there and there."
"You're not smart for that."
"But that's all we have."
"There's always a bigger one."
"I know what's in it."
"That's what I like about her."
"I feel like we're being watched."
"That's the only thing that matters to me."
"What do I do with him?"
"I realized something."
"I thought there was no one there."
"I heard you were looking for me."
"Explain to him about TV, games, etc."
"I was saving it for a more opportune moment."
"Well, you know what I mean."
"I didn't think he would."
"This film is based on a true story."
"You have no idea how much."
"I'll come by your shop to pick up the boy."
"I wonder what I'm doing here."
"You know what's the hardest part?"
"What am I supposed to say?"
"Who is ready is up to us to decide."
"That's what it's all about."
"I hope I haven't forgotten anything."
"Just tell me what to do."
"Please don't say that."
"It's time to party."
"What is he doing up there?"
"And what did you do?"
"And what did you do?"
"I hope you learned your lesson."
"I'm doing this for you."
"The important thing is that we are together."
"About an hour ago."
"You know I love you, right?"
"That's all it is."
"Is that the best you can do?"
"He's been gone for two months."
"I'm here to force you to meet your deadlines."
"What did he do to me?"
"But what does it matter?"
"You are the only one who can do it."
"I will write to say if I am free."
"Once again, here you are before us, Your Highness."
"What do you want to do with it?"
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"That's how I feel about you."
"There are many things to do."
"What's so surprising about that?"
"What do you want to do now?"
"I have powerful allies at court."
"You know exactly what I mean."
"I think this is a great idea."
"I think it's a great idea."
"You must trust me, Your Highness."
"I want you out of my life."
"It is an honor to work with you."
"You need to come home."
"Did she tell you that?"
"What makes you so happy?"
"What makes you so happy?"
"He was shot in the head."
"Do you have money to pay for this?"
"Where were you two nights ago?"
"What did she tell you?"
"What are you all doing here?"
"What are you all doing here?"
"How did you know I was here?"
"I have no one else to talk to."
"I need to take care of this."
"What's taking you so long?"
"For a smaller sum, I did it."
"That's what we're trying to do."
"I need to hear you say it."
"Did you hear what I said?"
"I have a small favor to ask of you."
"I did as you told me."
"What are you doing in my house?"
"Man is a wolf to man."
"Can you tell me what's going on?"
"Is that what you said?"
"Jan told you about Reno, right?"
"That's how he did it."
"No, I don't know where he is."
"Is that all you're capable of?"
"It's in the envelope, on the mantelpiece."
"What did he give you?"
"I've never heard of her."
"I need to go home."
"Do you want to give me a hand?"
"You don't believe what you're saying."
"I saw what he did."
"This role is destroying you."
"We saw it with our own eyes."
"But that's what happened."
"I take back everything I said."
"I love him more than anything in the world."
"What's in a name?"
"What happened to Mom?"
"What did you want to tell me?"
"If there's anything I can do."
"You do what you have to do."
"I read you like a book."
"When was the last time you saw her?"
"I hope it was worth it."
"Do I look like I need it?"
"Can I have some paper and pencil?"
"Because of what you did."
"But what am I going to do?"
"Call me back as soon as you get this message."
"I saw them with my own eyes."
"What do we do with this?"
"Is there anything we can do?"
"How could she do this to me?"
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"What are they doing there?"
"What do you want me to do with this?"
"Tell my children that I love them."
"I'll see if I can find it."
"I've never heard of them."
"Please make yourself at home."
"What are you still doing here?"
"That's where I come in."
"It's more than I can bear."
"This is the first time in my life."
"I have never seen anything like it."
"There are thousands like this."
"You're no match for him."
"I've already given the role to Lily."
"I had to get you out of there."
"It's nice of you to come."
"This is exactly what we need."
"That's exactly what I was thinking."
"I wonder what happened to him."
"I have tons of stuff to do."
"That's what I meant."
"I want you to come live with me."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please give me your attention."
"Is this something I did?"
"I have something else for you."
"I told you so."
"What is there about him?"
"What are you telling me?"
"Do you want to tell me what's going on?"
"Leave now before the soldiers come?"
"Where did your sense of humor go?"
"Please, please."
"What do you want me to do?"
"I was hoping you could tell me."
"Do you know where he is?"
"That's what I'm trying to say."
"That's why I called."
"No, what do you mean?"
"Do you think I need you?"
"We swear to do whatever you want."
"Do you remember what you were saying?"
"I have better things to do with my time."
"No question of wearing anything."
"I'm going to a motel for a few days."
"What makes grass grow?"
"They take by force, it's their nature."
"We know he's in on it."
"And I report the person to the police."
"Most of you will go to Vietnam."
"Have you seen what time it is?"
"It's just down the street."
"We made love under the oak tree."
"I want to know what's going on."
"Tell me what you want to do with it."
"So what are you going to do?"
"So what are you going to do?"
"Any idea what happened?"
"Do you want me to sing you a song?"
"There is the other side of the coin."
"I suggest you get going."
"It must have slipped his mind."
"There has been a change of plans."
"I'm glad you could come."
"I said I would do it."
"You will be entitled to the gladiator loop."
"Cassie, the lady in the rocking chair."
"I think I heard something."
"Is that why you do this?"
"The next day, early in the morning, the phone rings."
"It's the best part of my day."
"Orange and I jumped in the car."
"I've already had that one done to me."
"It is up to the Senate to pronounce the punishment."
"I'll give you five cents for your cake."
"My opinion on our involvement in the war?"
"You have to do what I tell you."
"He finally hit the jackpot."
"But we have a nice list of conquests."
"I have something to tell you too."
"There must be an answer to everything."
"With all due respect."
"Were you the one who found the body?"
"Look and tell me what you see."
"I put everyone in line."
"I can give you a hand."
"He followed us everywhere and closely."
"Victor, please come join us."
"You will only speak when you are spoken to."
"What did he say to her?"
"I had time to think about it."
"You love the Blessed Virgin, don't you?"
"What's keeping you awake?"
"What's going on, buddy?"
"At least that's what I believe."
"He knows exactly what he's doing."
"It's my bachelor party."
"I have the right to ask the question."
"I played on the Notre Dame team."
"I would like to ask you a very important question."
"You know that's against the rules."
"You can say a prayer, if you like."
"Let's see what you've got."
"You will have to, sooner than you think."
"Can I go to the bathroom?"
"It was in the heat of the moment."
"Is this heaven?"
"Do you think I meant to get to this point?"
"All my life I've been waiting for this moment."
"I'll give you a hand."
"The guys must have brought something down."
"That's what I wanted to talk about."
"I wonder if he had any prior history."
"Don't you see what's going on?"
"How long will it take for him to be here?"
"Hello, is anyone here?"
"Do you want me to tell you something?"
"Tell me instead what happened."
"At least, that's what I think."
"Can I give you a hand?"
"It's not just about that."
"Did you see what you did?"
"I don't take orders."
"What's wrong with your arm?"
"It's a bachelor party."
"What do you think happened?"
"That's how it works here."
"I was thinking about the fact that I love you."
"And from there, embark for his country."
"From the gentleman opposite."
"I have such an urge to fuck."
"That's the bottom line."
"Can someone explain to me what is happening?"
"Have you seen a lot of fights?"
"Making martyrs is my forte."
"I knew something was going on."
"What is love?"
"Where Barry's regiment was heading."
"And that's what happened."
"You must not be seen."
"Tell me exactly what you saw."
"That way I could see who had money."
"I did everything you asked."
"This is one of the parameters of my mission."
"What exactly happened?"
"I keep seeing them hiding."
"What do I deserve pleasure for?"
"That's the difference between you and me."
"I saw it just now."
"That's all I want to hear."
"You can say whatever you want."
"My friends and I were chosen."
"What can I do about it?"
"Can't you do better than that?"
"So what did you do?"
"Do you think there are enough?"
"What were you doing up there?"
"He arrived an hour ago."
"I dreamed about Del's mouse."
"What did you say your name was?"
"What's that inscription on your helmet?"
"Do you turn everything off at night?"
"What is your name and where are you going?"
"She left a while ago."
"By the way, who are you bringing these dispatches to?"
"Put me on the sidewalk, I'll manage."
"I know we would be good parents."
"That's why I love them."
"That's all we can say."
"But what can I do about it?"
"There must be someone else."
"Someone you'll pray with?"
"A lady in Chicago wrote a book."
"She is Mrs. H. She is beautiful."
"Make me have a million dollars."
"What do you have tonight?"
"It's a whole, a very small world."
"Kindly, he wanted to cheer you up."
"Nothing left and eternity to think about it."
"If you want to dream, that's your business."
"This is where it is most useful."
"I have a good one for you."
"But I see what you mean."
"I don't need another one."
"There are so many things to do."
"That's what we train for."
"What does this mean for us?"
"Something is happening."
"But what did I say?"
"The workshop roof needs to be redone."
"There are two legions in the garrison."
"How did you know I was here?"
"Say whatever comes to mind."
"I think I'll go to bed."
"She was just a force of nature."
"At camp, Barry's training continued."
"Is that how you see it?"
"He was there a moment ago."
"My current mission fits me like a glove."
"So what brings you here?"
"I'm sure he's doing great."
"I've already told the police everything."
"Can you tell us what's going on?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"Sometimes we talked until sunrise."
"He is in front, in the section area."
"Anything it can analyze by contact."
"Percy, I have a few questions for you."
"However, I cannot grant your request."
"And the spider that lived outside your window?"
"Nobody knows what's going on here."
"It's the exception that proves the rule."
"You stopped saying they exist."
"What are you still doing standing up?"
"I have some money saved up."
"I'm going to ask you one last time."
"After what I did for you."
"You will probably have a few hours."
"So that's what I'm going to do."
"What else did he tell you?"
"What did they do to us?"
"What if I don't agree?"
"Did you understand what I said?"
"And what does it matter?"
"Another thing is to see it up close."
"Does that answer your question?"
"Maybe once he's satisfied, he'll leave."
"You have the right to remain silent."
"Is that what's keeping you awake?"
"You're about to pass out."
"I know what kind of man you are."
"That's what it seemed to me."
"Do you want me to hold your hand?"
"Mr. Hughes, please rise to take the oath of office."
"Think about what you just did."
"I owe it to you."
"Back in the cell for evening roll call."
"Do you know where we're taking you tonight?"
"What do you like most?"
"But what she said was true."
"I'm just a businessman."
"It's about much more than that."
"It could have happened to anyone."
"Look what I did for you."
"Can you leave us, please?"
"I thought about you all night."
"What makes you say that?"
"Do you do everything I tell you to?"
"It's a pleasure to finally meet you."
"I knew I was forgetting something."
"Do you have family nearby?"
"So what do we have here?"
"I'll only say it once."
"The little one has to hide for a while."
"Because that's what we do."
"You don't think I know that?"
"From what I've been told."
"That's what he told us."
"Do you know what I was told?"
"I never thought I'd see you here."
"I love you, Spartacus, like my own father."
"I have to hide to see my friends."
"What are we supposed to do?"
"So what are you doing here?"
"Take all the time you need."
"What's going on around here?"
"You take the first job that comes along."
"What did I just do?"
"I have summoned the Senate to hear you."
"It's the most beautiful thing in the world."
"There is something written on it."
"I don't want that at the table."
"Because that's what you do."
"What do we know about him?"
"You told him, didn't you?"
"What did we imagine?"
"I have a bunch of convictions as a book."
"What's going on with her?"
"I go into the bathroom, and who's there?"
"I already have everything I want."
"And you, what do you do?"
"Is that what you were talking about, Locke?"
"Always happy to welcome the Board of Directors."
"I wish you had told me."
"You must have said ten words from Zurich."
"What is a game?"
"Do you know what that did to me?"
"Maybe there's no one there."
"No, it wasn't that fast."
"He's fine, he's a big boy."
"Easy to get there by car from Paris."
"Let me give you a hand."
"Let me give you a hand."
"It's up to you to tell us."
"I'll tell you when I know."
"Now he doesn't have to."
"Nothing is known about his mother yet."
"It's time to get to work."
"When was the last time you had it?"
"That's what I thought I understood."
"The few who survived had a gift."
"And what brings you here?"
"I had heard about the sweep."
"I have a mandate that says something else."
"Well, did they do that to me?"
"Some of you won't believe it."
"What do you want to do tonight?"
"The whole system started to fail."
"I take back what I just said."
"That's the kind of guy he is."
"I want six cups of coffee."
"I was told to come see you."
"You know what I thought?"
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"I've seen this hundreds of times."
"She's gone for two days, thank God."
"There are others like you."
"Hence God, and his theory of probability."
"Hi, what are you doing here?"
"What are you still doing here?"
"I bet he's in the Zone."
"You can stay here as long as you want."
"You're the one who should see a shrink."
"What did she do to me?"
"I am one of your biggest fans."
"What are you doing down there?"
"I have something important to say."
"And what do we do?"
"It's either one or the other."
"What happened in Marseille?"
"Bobby, what did you do?"
"It seems that this will be a memorable evening."
"I'll ask you again."
"It's so good to hear your voice."
"Where did you find it?"
"Good to see you, buddy."
"Which brings me to my next question."
"Not all men are like you."
"I haven't seen him since yesterday."
"And what did you see?"
"These things happen in the world."
"To what do I owe the honor of your visit?"
"I was told to give this to you."
"And you know what he said?"
"You need each other."
"That's the last thing I want."
"This could be our last night on Earth."
"It was my brother Dominic who held it."
"I hadn't heard that since school."
"That's all I said."
"I forgot to tell you something."
"I want to know what happened to him."
"You like him very much, don't you?"
"He shot a bullet into the ceiling."
"That's what I wanted to ask you."
"You never know what's going to happen."
"I have to go to the bathroom."
"Did you see what I did?"
"It brings tears to my eyes."
"Whatever we do, we have to stay together."
"I promised Herr Hitler a miracle."
"I have something that might interest you."
"It's better that you don't know."
"What's all this about?"
"Maybe it's for the best."
"I guarantee there is one."
"I'm sure it will work out."
"Season after season, he was a surefire winner."
"Raise another one and accompany your men."
"Let's say he decided."
"Over time, you will find it rather light."
"I think this is a great idea."
"M can do without me for a few days."
"That of a bright planet called Earth."
"If we said it, we did it."
"What did they do to you?"
"They told me you were here."
"Is that what happened?"
"What does he have to do with it?"
"That's why we love him."
"On a machine, one chance in a million."
"It's nice of you to think of me."
"Do you want to get me a piece of cake?"
"They say that clothes make the man."
"There's a new sheriff in town."
"I was on the other side of the world."
"Three years of seminary before becoming a cop."
"And what do we do now?"
"We have a patient who is critically ill."
"She doesn't know what she's saying anymore."
"Do you think we should do something?"
"What the hell are you doing with him?"
"Tell us what happened."
"I hope everything goes well."
"It's the details that sell your story."
"I should have come and picked you up myself."
"You have just entered the Twilight Zone."
"I promise you it won't happen again."
"You brought it here, you bring it back."
"If you feel like it, go ahead and talk."
"But what should I do?"
"Do you think it's easy for me?"
"That's why we're here."
"He was the one who sent me there."
"How did it go at school?"
"You just have to change your function."
"Drink it or I'll pour it on your lap."
"That's where it happened."
"I know it's the right decision."
"I've been thinking about this for a while."
"I give you everything I have."
"That night I had a dream."
"That's what I don't understand."
"So who's tough?"
"You asked me what I wanted."
"Have you ever seen anything like this?"
"It's good to have you with us."
"Are you sure he said that?"
"You always did what you wanted."
"If they have it, they can have you."
"And that's what you did."
"And that's what you did."
"Do you see what I had to put up with?"
"I did it, didn't I?"
"Is that how you see me?"
"But what are you doing?"
"The most important meal of the day."
"I had never told anyone."
"What did she do to you?"
"I have something outside to show you."
"What happened to them?"
"Are you suggesting we go to a hotel?"
"Thank God we discovered it in time."
"Who knows what they could have imagined."
"It happened two days ago."
"I will do whatever you tell me."
"What did you come to do?"
"He needs a helping hand."
"I love you and I want to marry you."
"Is there anything else?"
"It's time for you to go."
"Did you call my office to apologize?"
"This is what we are trying to understand."
"Is that why you're here?"
"What brings you to town?"
"That's how it's done."
"What the hell is going on?"
"You spend a lot of time in the Zone."
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"What made you leave?"
"He can tell us who framed us."
"My mother and brother are too."
"Do you have to park so close?"
"I am in the prime of life."
"I admire your notion of equal opportunity, sir."
"When was the last time you slept?"
"You are the most senior NCO."
"I did everything right."
"That's right, we didn't sign."
"Do you know the difference between you and me?"
"What else do you do?"
"Is this the best angle on the court?"
"Where could he be?"
"You're going to be late for school."
"No, it's not what you think."
"So what can I do?"
"I'm going to find a place for us to rest."
"Did she say anything?"
"They told me to go to Paris."
"What does that say about me?"
"It's what makes the world go round."
"But how much could I fit in my cupboards?"
"Look across the street."
"You should have told me sooner."
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"Is there something going on between you two?"
"I want the names of all his teammates."
"I have to make myself look good for them tomorrow."
"I have a 'cube of destiny' on me."
"I always knew this day would come."
"I keep telling you this."
"My friends and I discovered the passage."
"He was here a second ago."
"Yes, all local police communications."
"A view of the street, like a passage."
"Do you know what I don't understand?"
"Generally, that's about it."
"This is what I'm supposed to do."
"What do you want to tell me?"
"You think I didn't think about that?"
"But I have something to tell you."
"What are you doing here, man?"
"How long has this been going on?"
"I think I owe you an apology."
"I think I owe you an apology."
"I know this is a lot to ask."
"Are you waking me up to tell me about his vacation?"
"I've never heard of you."
"Meanwhile, you go in and out."
"What were you doing there?"
"You can tell him whatever you want."
"Like the nose in the middle of the face."
"I'm glad to see you again too."
"They will wait for his return from the White Tower."
"We did everything we could."
"It's a great place to raise children."
"What do you see when you close your eyes?"
"This is the way out."
"So, that's what we're going to do."
"But you could still talk to me, right?"
"Yes, it will be three years since then."
"You will have your share, and even first."
"You went to Blake's funeral."
"What are they going to do to me?"
"Your friend who got in the car?"
"I want to believe he can pull himself together."
"Their light takes so long to reach us."
"I would like to know what you think about it."
"I think it's better this way."
"Please don't go."
"Maybe he's a friend of hers."
"It turns out I like women."
"What else do you know?"
"These are the names they gave themselves."
"Wait, what do you mean?"
"I know you feel the same way."
"What did they give you?"
"It looks like there's something."
"I live with my uncle and aunt."
"It's great to have a secret identity."
"We take the first job that comes along."
"It's the middle of the night."
"Who put that in your head?"
"It's a time machine."
"It's a miracle he survived."
"Tony, what are you doing here?"
"She's not here at the moment."
"You did what you could."
"I think your wife will like it."
"No, and I don't want to know."
"I'm also a scientist, of sorts."
"I wanted you to know that."
"Will you tell me the story of the fort?"
"What is it, exactly?"
"I do everything to be fair to Pepper."
"And what did you find?"
"I have never shot anyone."
"Do you know what I'm going to do to you?"
"What exactly did she say?"
"I like how the artist uses blue."
"It's you I came to see."
"I've had a real name for several years."
"He was a founding member of SHIELD."
"I was like a father to you."
"His role was to make money."
"So you can change it if you want."
"Follow the new road to the church."
"We have so much to tell each other."
"I'll tell you what it is."
"We need to get people out of here."
"Yes, from a purely economic point of view."
"What does it say?"
"You are going to take part in a great adventure."
"The Dark Lord gathers all armies."
"What are you doing here man?"
"About what's going on with your son."
"A vortex with an Einstein-Rosen bridge."
"I want you to know that."
"I have something to tell you too."
"Someone has taken control of the software."
"Call me if you need me."
"You must have known some of the team members."
"What are you doing tomorrow night?"
"You deserve the comfort of an old friend."
"You have the right to consult a lawyer."
"I'll have to keep your armor for a while."
"That's all I think about."
"I knew I had seen it before."
"Will we have to take care of the transition?"
"How did it feel?"
"There is always a price to pay."
"What if a technician thought he only saw an echo?"
"There are people inside."
"I want everything to be clear between us."
"Have you ever seen anything like this?"
"It's the most beautiful place in the world."
"It's the most beautiful place in the world."
"My former colleagues may see it that way."
"It shows you're sane."
"It's nice of you to join us."
"Grandmother Death wrote a book."
"He needs to go to the hospital."
"What happened between you two?"
"So what did she say?"
"Tell them we're going west."
"The others never saw their future."
"I have to go, I have to go."
"I've never seen anything like this."
"Anything is for hunters."
"You will only have one thing to do."
"I'm glad you could come."
"I'm glad you could come."
"You are the only family I have."
"You hid on board for five days."
"What could have done this?"
"They confessed two hours ago."
"It was the best solution for now."
"I'm sure you'll like it."
"I want you to make me a promise."
"Even when we were too young to understand."
"I told you not to come back."
"My friend, you can take back your armor."
"This is what I want for you."
"To my great pride, we have eight."
"I thought I knew what to expect."
"I told the housekeeper to stay."
"What brings you to Bree?"
"That's all it takes to please them."
"That's what I was getting at."
"You are the most beautiful girl in the world."
"I think I know what it is."
"What am I to you?"
"I was craving sesame soup."
"Be someone once in your life."
"That's why I came to see you."
"I already have what I need."
"You have a lot to say to each other."
"I'll let it go since it's goodbye."
"I could see myself there in five years."
"Thank you very much, that's very kind of you."
"That's what I understood."
"May the Force of others be with you."
"We have everything we need."
"What are you doing standing there?"
"And that's what they did."
"So what did you do?"
"What do I do with her?"
"I have a big favor to ask of you."
"I told you I would."
"I can't think of anything else."
"Is it true or is it not true?"
"The other hanged himself in his cell."
"I may write for several newspapers."
"I hope that's not true."
"I always dreamed of having one."
"Are you sure it's yours?"
"I'll take care of it from now on."
"And he seemed to like it."
"Thank you, that's what I wanted to hear."
"No, that's not what they say."
"We will finish the work of justice.'"
"Is this your best?"
"I didn't ask you to do this."
"Do you want to take my console to your office?"
"I'm in the mall parking lot."
"I had never heard that name before."
"I've never heard anything so great."
"The Church of the Third Revelation welcomes you."
"Come right away, and you have me."
"They will tell you how to do it."
"Are you protecting a friend who betrayed you?"
"It's as much your victory as it is mine."
"There are four of them in the room, not three."
"A lot has happened since then."
"This is exactly what I want to do."
"No, I'll only be a minute."
"The sale falls through if you are tied to it."
"I don't have an answer for that."
"Is that what it's about?"
"Is there one you like?"
"So what's going on here?"
"I think there is something else."
"Is there any news from the Philippines?"
"Do you think I haven't tried?"
"I never stopped loving you."
"I got a call from Celeste Boyle."
"That's what I wanted to ask you."
"That's what I love about you."
"Could you do this to my son?"
"This is where our conversation takes place."
"I must speak to the Jedi Council immediately."
"What's going on here?"
"After everything he did to you?"
"Do you think there is a connection?"
"What is it?"
"I don't have time to wait."
"His body was found in the lab."
"Can you tell me what we're doing?"
"Where can we find it?"
"Do you know where she is?"
"That's what I told myself."
"He's the guy we needed."
"Find me a flight. We're going to Langley."
"There must be a way out."
"I need a bodyguard."
"I see exactly what you mean."
"If you keep looking at her like that."
"If we can adapt working hours."
"You know very well that it's not possible."
"Spider-Man on the front page, with a decent photo."
"There's always someone else."
"I didn't say that either."
"My God, what's going on?"
"You were to stay on the command ship."
"I have to take this for now."
"Can you give me a hand?"
"Eight days in it is like a year."
"Are you going to say something?"
"To reconstruct Katie's schedule."
"I have never been in a car."
"They are lucky to have you."
"Do you have time for a coffee?"
"What do you think will happen?"
"It's a pleasure to meet you, sir."
"Did he do this to you?"
"Everything can be accomplished with technology."
"Are you working while we're in bed?"
"You know that, don't you?"
"We can spot them by the way they bet."
"That's why you have to leave."
"I would be sorry to speak into the void."
"What happened to you is unfair."
"Thank you all for this wonderful evening."
"It's easy for you to say that."
"Can I take a look at it?"
"This is the tip of the iceberg."
"This is where Ray was brought."
"Did you hear what he said?"
"I hope you aren't."
"Is that all you want to know?"
"She picks up her husband at the airport."
"I brought you a little something."
"You know how everything works, except people."
"Vegas had never known a guy like him."
"How do you get a head in there?"
"I tell her I still want her."
"I can give it to whoever I want."
"Then I threw it in the Mystic."
"All the great actions of the Royal Guard."
"Nothing is more important than family."
"I only told you."
"Did she tell you who it was?"
"What does it matter now?"
"The bandages just came off this afternoon."
"How long has it been since you saw him?"
"No one remembers their early childhood."
"It's like I told the girls."
"What is he doing here?"
"You have to tell that to all the girls."
"It's him I want to talk to."
"Have I ever told you about my father?"
"It's just around the corner."
"Do you think you'll get me like that?"
"Did you send it to me?"
"You will become a Jedi, I promise you."
"I just took it back, that's all."
"And she wrote a book about it."
"I promised my wife a trip."
"Can I get you something to drink?"
"Looks like we have visitors."
"They said you were on Mars."
"You will never see anything more real than me."
"I've never been so proud of myself."
"It's what you do best."
"Like when a puppy shits on a carpet."
"I've seen this a million times."
"You haven't seen him for a long time?"
"And from the Shire, according to your speech."
"No, there is nothing to say."
"I even think I'm going to create some."
"That's very kind, but I'll get there."
"The book describes what I saw."
"Are you implying that I am the cause?"
"You talk, they think it's me."
"Did you do all this?"
"I couldn't come earlier."
"What do you know about him?"
"That's what he gave me."
"Sorry, that's all I have."
"It's more than I earn."
"I knew you had it in you."
"What do you think you're doing?"
"He will need you before the end."
"Don't venture into the shallows."
"We are perfect for each other."
"So where are we?"
"This city will never be the same again."
"What did I say again?"
"What happened at school?"
"You just have to tell me."
"And maybe I'll have a quickie."
"I said I'd take care of it."
"Here he is to the left of the man."
"What do you know about it?"
"Have you seen what time it is?"
"So you've crossed the perimeter."
"Let's see what we have to do here."
"I hadn't planned any of this."
"Where will he fit best?"
"I wonder what he did."
"I would like you to do me a favor."
"No, I've never seen it before."
"Do you see where I'm going with this?"
"Wait, what does that mean?"
"Do you even know what it is?"
"I have so much to tell you."
"When did I do this?"
"What do you have in there?"
"For me, it's being with you."
"I reviewed all of its security settings."
"Do you know what it looks like?"
"We are doing absolutely everything we can."
"How did you afford all that?"
"Is this how you thank me?"
"The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer."
"When was the last time you spoke to him?"
"For Neil, when we're done here, call."
"It's time for me to go home."
"Did you see what happened?"
"You can come and sign the transfer document."
"He had the last word."
"You think I'm a good guy?"
"I know you're hiding something from me."
"Someone made the first move."
"And I realized it was you."
"Can we go, please?"
"That's how I saw it."
"Call me if there is any change."
"Remember what I said."
"It's a story as old as time."
"I've never felt this way about anyone."
"I don't think so, I know it."
"It's like you don't exist."
"I know you don't like them."
"And what do you plan to do?"
"I'm doing something."
"That's what I like about him."
"I'm glad you came."
"What are they going to do to us?"
"It's not about him."
"I have experience in this field."
"Did something happen between you?"
"You're part of my flock now."
"Do you feel that I see into your heart?"
"I thought you didn't like him."
"When was the last time you ate?"
"Try putting it on your head."
"I chose not to."
"What if I can't find it?"
"What do we expect from you?"
"I remind you that you are under oath."
"Nicky was the new big guy in Las Vegas."
"My wife gives them to me."
"What do you have for us?"
"What do you have for us?"
"And I'll be fine by this afternoon."
"Hi, what are you doing here?"
"I see what you're trying to do."
"It's a kind of high-tech prosthesis."
"I climbed to the top to hang myself."
"I received a letter from your wife."
"What's mine is yours."
"But especially for you, we started."
"When I saw him, I thought of you."
"Maybe he knows how to make the Romans disappear."
"And the analysis of vital parameters is excellent."
"I hope I will be up to it."
"For now, you give him a chance."
"Let him go or I'll slit your throat."
"What do you have to say about this?"
"But as a couple, you have to be happy together."
"This is the world we live in."
"This is the world we live in."
"The method is that they are good."
"And that's when it happened."
"In the wheel and dashboard."
"This is the best night of my life."
"A recent conversation comes to mind."
"He's leaving tomorrow and the girl with him."
"I'll tell you what to do and how."
"I think I saw something."
"Do you know what he told me?"
"You'll tell me how it went."
"Don't you want me to take you?"
"Be smart, to get what you want."
"I'm doing this for him."
"Let a friend tell you."
"Everything you said was true."
"We found ourselves face to face, yes."
"Where did you learn to play like that?"
"Where did you learn to play like that?"
"I'm so glad you're okay."
"I did what I thought was right."
"For this purpose, we will form the square."
"I think I have the right to do so."
"The Emperor has a special plan for them."
"So you know what I did?"
"What should I tell them?"
"One of our chickens for one of yours."
"What makes you so sure?"
"What makes you so sure?"
"Security check before changing zones."
"Let me go and I'll tell you."
"You were supposed to be home an hour ago."
"I think I'm in love with her."
"I'm glad we did that."
"What is this story?"
"I have something important to tell you."
"My mother made them."
"It's like he's still talking to me."
"I was just about to call you."
"You will learn to use it like I did."
"Does this guy know what his daughter is going through?"
"If you don't mind."
"I have some more questions for you."
"Not a soul knows him there."
"You can tell me whatever you want."
"Breathe fresh air again, my friend."
"She only does what she wants."
"I want to know what to expect."
"I say he wanted to feel normal."
"Dressed in the latest Roman fashion."
"I go there on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
"That's how it happened."
"He asked me to give this to you."
"Maybe it's better this way."
"Especially since he got us the beers."
"I have a ton of things to do."
"Do you know what time he came home?"
"You act like nothing happened."
"Beyond government and police."
"The fate of humanity is at stake."
"Tell me what you know about her."
"I'm sure you'll find something."
"I'm sure you'll find something."
"You must not tell him about me."
"What options do we have?"
"That's what I was talking about."
"I promised I wouldn't."
"But my favorite Cuban is Ricky Ricardo."
"Tomorrow we will bring you back to life."
"Is this supposed to make me feel better?"
"What are we having for dinner?"
"You look like you need it."
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"I am one with the Force."
"No, I don't know where she is."
"I will find new ways to motivate them."
"There are more and more of them."
"Do you know of a place to rent around here?"
"I used to play there when I was your age."
"I knew what I had to do."
"That's what you don't understand."
"He's the one putting pressure on you."
"How do you know if their protective field is working?"
"That's what you've always done."
"Your mother was with her at the end."
"The father will have to identify him at the morgue."
"You're still reading about orchids, I hope?"
"But what does that mean?"
"I'm in love with someone else."
"I'm in love with someone else."
"I had a great time tonight."
"All I want is you."
"Do I look good?"
"That's the last thing I would want."
"Did you understand what he said?"
"What's going to happen tonight?"
"There has to be something."
"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
"I have a visit to make with you."
"I know what I'm going to do."
"You've been lucky all week."
"I'm telling you this for the last time."
"I guess we'll never know."
"I'm sure it will go well."
"So this is the famous 'Book of Brothers'?"
"Put it back where you got it."
"That's what you're paid for."
"I just came to bring you the check."
"Do you want to know what happened?"
"It's good to have you back."
"People come from all over to see him."
"I have the greatest respect for you."
"I hope it goes well."
"I thought I was going to faint."
"Is this what you want to be?"
"But what happened to you?"
"I'll take care of it from here."
"I quit years ago."
"I have to show the spectrum of the flower."
"I have some great news to tell you."
"You didn't answer my calls."
"Do your research and bring me his companions."
"I want to know everything you know."
"I want to see it with my own eyes."
"Maybe you can tell me who it is."
"I need you to do me a favor."
"This station will be operational on the scheduled date."
"I don't think anyone can say."
"Is it like a plant, in the earth?"
"I thought you would never arrive."
"In theory I agree with you."
"Did you see the state she's in?"
"You have to go through the proper channels."
"You're a genius, you're a genius."
"Did you see what she did?"
"What is he going to do with it?"
"It was the best night of my life."
"Raise your right hand and repeat after me."
"What do you think is going on here?"
"Where are we going?"
"What is this?"
"What do you say, huh?"
"I'm here to tell you the truth."
"That's what we do there."
"No, you don't have to."
"I heard you were looking for me."
"I need to clear my head."
"And as they say, it's a new broom."
"I'm sorry, but it's the truth."
"That's not what interests me."
"Is there something I should know?"
"I have a score to settle with you."
"Are you sure about what you're saying?"
"It's going to be just like old times."
"It's fascinating, I make pornography."
"We came as soon as we knew."
"I have something you'll like."
"You have something to say, say it."
"What makes you believe that?"
"It's a bank account number."
"You could have told me you were coming."
"You should have told me sooner."
"There are plenty of things to do."
"I should have told you sooner."
"It's really the world upside down."
"Where did you learn to dance like that?"
"That's how it's played."
"Please answer the question."
"There is only one possible explanation."
"I wonder what's going on."
"We'll make it work."
"He was like that all day."
"I want you to come home."
"Please take me with you."
"She said she was going for a walk."
"But what do you know about it?"
"You didn't answer the question."
"We wonder what we have done."
"Thanks, but I have to go to the airport."
"Who knows what the tide may bring?"
"She says I don't understand her."
"It takes us five years to train a legion."
"Is everyone okay at home?"
"A young man rang, asking for a phone call."
"I could accept my mother's promotion."
"Finally, what does that mean?"
"You look like you're in a cult."
"We were just talking about it."
"I wonder who will play my role."
"Well, what are we going to do?"
"He is abroad, for his work."
"What purpose is your soul occupied with?"
"Because that's who I am."
"Have your man call me for the exchange."
"You did well to come see me."
"I feel like I already know you."
"Was your father related to the Van Garretts?"
"You can look for it wherever you want."
"You didn't say the magic word."
"I decided we had to stay here."
"Will I ever be as fast as you?"
"They are very hardworking and will serve you well."
"How long can a whale stay underwater?"
"What made you change?"
"Can I count on you?"
"They put him in the back."
"You didn't tell him about us?"
"We also named some of your friends."
"Can I ask you a specific question?"
"And the father of the industrial military era."
"And what will you do with the big, big money?"
"Maybe I should have left it outside."
"Yes, that's what we're going to do."
"Yes, I know what that means."
"An FBI agent came to see me."
"We think this is their next move."
"That's what he was told."
"Does this remind you of anything?"
"If that's really what you want."
"The women here always have been."
"This is what I want you to do."
"Nothing is more important than the Expo."
"She came to us with a young physique."
"I know what I have to do now."
"How did you know it was me?"
"How did you know it was me?"
"So they had an accomplice on the inside?"
"I'll call you if I have any news."
"That's exactly what they're going to do."
"It's the best time of day."
"I have everything you need."
"If you find it, it will be yours."
"But that's what I did."
"I thought we would have more time."
"You saw what you wanted to see."
"Bob found one in New Castle."
"I'll tell you what you want to know."
"This is where the driver installs."
"Tell me what you have in mind."
"I need a little more time."
"The fact remains that you were shot."
"Do you remember what happened?"
"Yoda spoke of someone else."
"You could have told me earlier."
"Are you even listening to me?"
"That's what he just said."
"I only need one thing."
"It never crossed my mind."
"We swear to serve the master of the Precious."
"He wanted Christmas to last all year round."
"Maybe something happened to him."
"She didn't say where she was going?"
"Maybe the machine isn't working."
"I came to ask your permission?"
"I think he had good reasons."
"What are you doing, buddy?"
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"He's the one trying to take Aaron."
"Have you never taken a hot shower?"
"I heard what he said."
"I'll tell you anything you want."
"Did you send him that check or not?"
"He is still the most gifted of the three."
"That's all you need."
"I thought it was next week."
"You'll have to do the honors for me."
"That's the beauty of it."
"The car is in the name of Cindy Bradley."
"Why are you telling me this?"
"I know what people think of me."
"So, there had to be deaths."
"I told you to take care of it."
"To what do I owe the honor of this visit?"
"You will be used for inside surveillance."
"Not everyone can be smart."
"What can I offer you?"
"Do you want me to read you a story?"
"It's you I need."
"What are you doing down there?"
"I thought you would be proud of me."
"Shouldn't you go back to bed?"
"Do you know what they did to me?"
"He's more machine than man."
"I know what you want to tell me."
"You haven't been to his apartment?"
"But let's take a look at building C."
"All gladiators in the training area."
"What did you say there?"
"There's something for you below."
"I told him everything before the wedding."
"Go ahead, what do I say?"
"Is this how you have fun?"
"When was the last time we saw her?"
"What did you say to him?"
"Go see over there if I'm there."
"Will Phil see his shadow when he leaves?"
"You are the spitting image of your mother."
"I only told the truth."
"We don't toast with water."
"Your father must be turning in his grave."
"He lived a thousand years ago."
"She will have to stay there until further notice."
"Then, and only then, will you be a Jedi."
"Do I look different?"
"You think I don't know?"
"I've always had a soft spot for you."
"So what are we doing here?"
"I don't remember it very well."
"I'll tell you what I'm talking about."
"You made yourself a new lightsaber."
"This is the only way to be sure."
"We both took stock."
"What else can I do for you?"
"I will come see her at my next rest."
"I am not what you think."
"Now we are back where we were."
"What are you doing that's beautiful?"
"What can you tell me?"
"I talk about this in Seduce and Destroy."
"I wonder what happened to them."
"Like the wizard who left it for you."
"That's what they told us."
"You are the best person I know."
"So she stays to take care of her."
"What would you do without me?"
"I'll tell you everything I know."
"My men are working as fast as they can."
"What did the doctor say?"
"What brings you here, Mrs. Chan?"
"I had never seen her like this."
"Have you ever eaten fish heads?"
"There is still some good in him."
"But what is it doing there?"
"This is the best news of the day."
"What's in the boxes?"
"For everything I've done to you."
"Wait here and try to clear a path."
"What are you trying to prove?"
"Can you go home whenever you want?"
"I think I have to tell you."
"Your father and I are old friends."
"Put the same number in each muffin."
"Do you always do what you're told?"
"Your donations to our museum are very generous."
"I look up and down."
"Maybe it's my brain chemistry?"
"I'm so glad you're here."
"He asked me to tell you."
"I only saw him from behind."
"I have new workers arriving tomorrow."
"You will find what you need there."
"We have lots of things to tell each other."
"What do I have to do to prove it to you?"
"What were you doing in Delia's room?"
"What did she just say?"
"Is there anything else I can do?"
"I don't need anyone else."
"You take Spider-Man's pictures, right?"
"Talk to Sonny and his two brothers."
"Of all colors, of all races."
"Please, I need to talk to him."
"He helps my father from time to time."
"That's all he can say."
"What's going through the tunnel?"
"I'll meet you here in half an hour."
"The museum director sends you a car."
"Have you thought that our guests will know?"
"You are now in the service of the Steward."
"And what do I have left?"
"Is your son-in-law given an important position?"
"I need a tough guy like you."
"Have you seen your son's work?"
"Christians dug centuries later."
"I used a personal transporter."
"No, I wasn't that lucky."
"Glad to see you enjoying this good wine."
"Both guys were put on trial."
"You are so smart to have seen it."
"I will give you whatever you want."
"Can we have the icon in bright blue?"
"I've never seen a funnier guy."
"It's because he was so smart."
"I think together we can solve it."
"Have you ever seen a baby do that?"
"Please do this for me."
"Please do this for me."
"I'll tell you what's going on."
"I had nothing better to do."
"Except I didn't."
"Don't tell me you're interested."
"I think it's the right decision."
"I put the pans in the box."
"Your mother called, she wants to see you."
"We're about to find out."
"We're about to find out."
"I thought you should know."
"A large sum, to count it in public."
"He sometimes assumed both personalities."
"You taught me that."
"What were you doing in the middle of the road?"
"Sorry, man, but you can't escape it."
"I am an old friend of the family."
"How long will he stay there?"
"It's a wonderful feeling to be 'cancelled'."
"You say people don't care."
"Is there room for me?"
"But what do you want to do?"
"One step closer to economic balance."
"This is the second to last piece to remove."
"What's up?"
"They are children, but they are strong."
"I was hoping you could tell me."
"I was hoping you could tell me."
"So what is the nature of your business?"
"I swear you won't miss him anymore."
"Could you talk about the Chamber of Secrets?"
"What is the plan for extracting the prisoners?"
"I saw what came over him."
"What is she doing there?"
"He's two days ahead of you."
"I know what I have to do."
"I am everything you want to be."
"Yes, that's what I heard."
"Is that how you like it?"
"You seem fine to me."
"My parents did the same thing for years."
"I think it's the right time."
"This is the power supply for the glasses."
"I think you might be right."
"I was in the right place at the right time."
"Ginny has been talking about you all summer."
"Who says I'm not?"
"Do you know what I just saw?"
"I knew we could count on you."
"Did he tell you he loved you?"
"We are on the other side of the mirror."
"You will make her a woman."
"I thought about you every day."
"No, there is no buffer."
"If you want to continue with me, just say so."
"I'll do it, I'll do it."
"No, they monitor what people read."
"She was like that all day."
"That's really all I have."
"I don't think there's anyone there."
"I'm going to be honest and tell him everything."
"I don't do fashion photography anymore."
"What do you miss the most?"
"I could have told you myself."
"You're the one pushing the envelope, Mel."
"I needed to talk to someone."
"I need you to do something."
"What the hell are you doing in there?"
"What if I can't do it?"
"I believe everything you tell me."
"I was always one step behind Tyler."
"Get some strength for later."
"Mother, I thought we were going to be able to talk."
"That's up to me to decide."
"I also want to thank you for your idea."
"That's all I can promise."
"What did I say again?"
"So what should we do?"
"I tell him we'll take two."
"I think I got it."
"It took longer than expected."
"You look like you're having fun."
"That's what I thought at first."
"It was this girl who interrupted me."
"Did you know I teach middle school?"
"Perhaps the psychiatrist will get something out of this."
"They told me you were here."
"You know very well who I'm talking about."
"And you, what do you have?"
"What are we going to do to him?"
"Am I making myself clear?"
"She told me to give this to you."
"And also on Friday nights of tuberculosis."
"Are you sure it's this way?"
"I want you to do me a favor."
"I need you to come get me."
"That's the hardest part of this job."
"It's time for you to go to bed."
"This cross belongs in a museum."
"He did everything, and even infinitely more."
"I'm telling you everything I know."
"And I feel like we're going to get along."
"But Mr. Perfect had better be polite."
"What kind of world is this, anyway?"
"Please don't touch me."
"That's what they're here for."
"What do you really want to do?"
"I felt out of place."
"No, I don't need you anymore."
"I have so much to tell you."
"Any idea who could have done this?"
"You can come see us whenever you want."
"Did you see what happened to him?"
"What does he want?"
"I need a girls' night out."
"I just saw you on TV."
"I've never been able to choose."
"The photos were taken before their arrival."
"You should listen to your wife, she's right."
"It's good for what you have."
"You told me he was a bartender."
"What will happen to us?"
"We need a quarterback and a miracle."
"If you have to go, you have to go."
"Your name is not on the list."
"I knew a guy at school."
"What do I have to gain?"
"Did he say anything?"
"Is it the same as last time?"
"What did I do with it?"
"He has a bull's head helmet."
"You will tell me what you think."
"This is the beginning of a long journey."
"I cross this bridge twice a day."
"I do what you told me."
"Don't you want to chat a little longer?"
"I decided to take it all on myself."
"I understand that you like music."
"You let your husband have a child with you."
"Just do what you have to do."
"It was my father who taught me."
"Before its beginnings and until the end."
"I can, but I don't."
"I have exactly what you need."
"Mr. Reactor accepted the modified core."
"How did you know I was here?"
"No one stepped on his toes."
"These communists, they always tell you what to do."
"How many times have I told you?"
"You know that, don't you?"
"There are telephones in your rooms."
"Are you sure about what you're doing?"
"There is one way to find out."
"That's how the world works."
"What do you know about it?"
"I don't know, but we'll find out."
"What are you doing here at this hour?"
"Haven't we already talked about this?"
"Maybe we are of the same race."
"You are indeed your father's daughter."
"I told him everything about you."
"So what are you doing here?"
"It's time you left."
"Thank you for following this season with us."
"I'm sure you'll find a way."
"My apartment in Venice is at your disposal."
"Do you know the guy who created this?"
"Everyone in the region knows it."
"But we have no other plan."
"It's the least you can do."
"No, that's all I have."
"You told me 'Except for Mr. Shadow'."
"May I have my cigarettes, please?"
"It's like I told you."
"I never had the chance."
"I need your voice on the Council."
"It's peace that scares me."
"But we pay people in the press."
"You turned your jacket inside out from the rope."
"I'm part of your imagination too, Joel."
"The girl was found in a toilet."
"Let's assume we enter the unit for nothing."
"Do you know what he did to her?"
"What did you do to him?"
"Tell me, what's going on?"
"I know how much you loved him."
"She was under illusions about my voice."
"How can you tell me such a thing?"
"I had several ideas this morning too."
"They almost won, by a yard."
"I know what people say about me."
"We have everything we need here."
"I wonder why I called you."
"How many times have I told you?"
"I took this class at his school."
"Take the day off and come back on Monday dressed properly."
"What's on your finger?"
"What's wrong with your nose?"
"A clean office is an efficient office."
"He wanted to blame you."
"And back here tomorrow for lunch."
"I need you right away."
"Now the hand points to four minutes to midnight."
"What made you come back?"
"Donald, please open your eyes."
"Are you sure you want to go?"
"I see a lot of courage around me."
"Can you tell him I called?"
"Did I go to bed earlier every night?"
"Look, it's from a king's palace."
"He might have some guys of his own."
"Ready to sacrifice himself for a good cause."
"To stick tubes in his parts."
"I think this is an excellent idea."
"You were saying how great it was."
"You see, that's what I was saying."
"We can do whatever we want with it."
"Yes, that's what I think."
"Maybe this is one of them."
"Is that what you said?"
"That's what it does to me."
"I need to make some space."
"Isn't that what attracts women?"
"I'll make sure we stay."
"It's a pleasure to finally meet you."
"God made man in his image."
"At least, that's what I thought."
"Do you remember how we got back here?"
"She can cash it in at the candy store."
"So we went to your house."
"A file is built on details."
"Aren't you a little late?"
"I hope you had fun."
"Gin, I have partners in the business."
"Let's see what they say about this one."
"Up, down, up, down."
"Is anyone on board?"
"I'll call you if I have any news."
"I know you will take care of me."
"I haven't heard from you."
"There are more coming."
"I have fond memories of this dog."
"Is that what it's all about, Manny?"
"I didn't ask for any of this."
"I also do Laurel and Hardy in Spanish."
"I want you to remember this moment."
"What do you want me to do with this?"
"Did you tell him it was me?"
"I raised my daughter the American way."
"To say I was a nice guy."
"What are you going to do there?"
"I told you not to come back."
"It's just a piece of wood."
"This is the best we have."
"There is an old-fashioned cabinet."
"What did you tell them?"
"Surprise yourself if you want to surprise your audience."
"I have to go to school."
"You did this to me."
"I thought you might want to know."
"I know what everyone is thinking."
"Are you sure you don't want anything?"
"I think you owe us an explanation."
"Jump in and stuff your big thing in there."
"I feel like I could love you here."
"And what do we do with these little fish?"
"I would have to ask my husband."
"I left literature and journalism."
"Look what you made me do."
"I would tell you if I knew."
"It won't happen again, I promise you."
"Since you brought dinner, let's eat it."
"What did they do to you?"
"Is it about you and me?"
"No one comes to see her anymore."
"And that's what we did."
"So what are you going to answer?"
"What else do we know?"
"No, you know what I mean."
"That's all I could do."
"You know, we were all proud of you."
"But you have to be exactly me."
"Now I have only one hope."
"We took the same dance class."
"What are you getting at?"
"Do you want me to give you one?"
"You think you're better than me, perhaps?"
"The Royal Ballet has had an excellent season."
"To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir?"
"He will go and get the Grail for us."
"You're the one who came to see me."
"You're here to cover my back."
"I was about to do it."
"Who are you to order me around?"
"I admire you and your beautiful wife."
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"It is an important role in the Family."
"So what did it give?"
"You and I could do business."
"You know what you have to do."
"I was talking about your mother, your motel."
"There is a girl in the garden."
"I made the decision."
"You have something I need."
"My father helped him in his career."
"He disappeared a few years ago."
"What did he have to say?"
"There's something I'm missing."
"Do you need anything?"
"There is enough to build a bank."
"What stopped you?"
"This is exactly what he needs."
"But finally, what is going on?"
"Have you ever driven one of these things?"
"In our region, the environment is completely different."
"Actually, I know your work very well."
"It is against the laws of nature."
"But what can we do about it?"
"No, that's what I thought."
"I received a letter the other day."
"I want you to make love to me."
"Don't you want to go home?"
"I'm just following his orders."
"He wants to thank you for inviting him."
"I have some questions to ask first."
"That's how I knew."
"But that's because of the baby."
"What could I possibly do?"
"It's because I'm a woman."
"One day she will say why she left."
"Thank you all for coming tonight."
"I'm sure it will work out."
"What do they call you at home?"
"Near the one you like the most."
"I must have a face that inspires confidence."
"It's to hear you better, my child."
"Things are happening that are beyond our control."
"I was caught in the rain all day."
"Everything you said is true."
"Is that what they told you?"
"What do you know about women?"
"But on Saturday evening, we discovered something else."
"But that's how it works."
"She dreamed of seeing me at the Opera."
"Please have another glass."
"I just don't like it."
"What are you doing here?"
"I did everything to make it work."
"You have a whole room to yourself."
"There was water on the ground."
"I need to know what happened to him."
"Who says I need it?"
"What are you telling me?"
"And we went to dinner, right?"
"It looks like a real idea factory here."
"Can you tell me what it is?"
"Maybe less, if I make a deal."
"What does it have to do with it?"
"There is a police car outside."
"I was the one who called him."
"Or we could focus on getting Doug back."
"I just wanted to say I'm sorry."
"Is that all you can say?"
"He passed very close to my machine."
"Honestly, have you ever seen anything like this?"
"Now you and I can prevent that."
"I think I have it in me."
"The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."
"This is the cup of the King of Kings."
"She watched over you until dawn."
"Germany has declared war on the Joneses."
"You have very beautiful eyes, you know."
"I see what you're trying to do."
"I hope it's not too late."
"I have a couple of things to sort out."
"I told you what I knew."
"You have to tell that to all the girls."
"I need some money."
"Is this your first time here?"
"I've seen it hundreds of times."
"A child's life is at stake."
"You know you can count on me."
"I think I know what happened."
"Drive it and bring it back after the shot."
"It will take a little longer."
"What were you going to tell me?"
"Who will stay with you if I leave you?"
"No, he was definitely there."
"Do you think it's worth it?"
"He was the food industry terrorist."
"And what did I say?"
"Glad to see you in one piece."
"What do you think, Tony?"
"Your mother and I are old friends."
"What do I have to do?"
"I don't know, but it's ours."
"This is the third time this month."
"Tell me the number, please."
"Do you remember what the tablet said?"
"I was with a woman once."
"Who told you I was here?"
"Don't you see what he's doing?"
"You don't know me, but I do."
"I thought it was a good idea."
"So what am I doing here?"
"This will be the best moment of my day."
"Did you listen to what I said?"
"Of course I remember you."
"You're just a good-for-nothing."
"You were the one who came up with the idea."
"This is the only way to protect them."
"The second test is the Word of God."
"But what am I doing here?"
"I just need to get some fresh air."
"Two types of talent in the same family."
"Have you been here long?"
"Do you see what you're making me do?"
"We have to stick together."
"Who told you I was here?"
"I found the cable on the beach."
"That's why I love you."
"You have a good sense of humor."
"How do we deal with this cop?"
"You're the one who's burning yourself, Gras-double."
"What makes it so special?"
"Any idea what it could be?"
"I'll tell you what we'll do."
"If that's it, I'll give it to you."
"No, my health does not allow it."
"I've been here for an hour."
"What's not fair?"
"Tell me exactly what happened."
"I did what seemed right to me."
"Let me take a look at it."
"What are you doing here, man?"
"That's what the doctor said."
"I'll tell you what you are."
"You know what I don't understand?"
"All flights to L.A. are full."
"Except that 'you' doesn't mean anything anymore."
"Not sure this is a good idea."
"No, you're the one who's going to listen to me."
"I've seen this a million times."
"This is what I want to talk to you about."
"This is what I want to talk to you about."
"I might have a job for you."
"I think so, but he's a good guy."
"Who else knows about this?"
"You fought to get transferred here."
"Do you need a hand?"
"I've been thinking about this all day."
"Is it you or isn't it you?"
"I see you've thought about this a lot."
"Now tell me what happened."
"You never wanted my friendship."
"Please do it for me."
"You told me not to move."
"No, that's not it either."
"She will give you the item after the concert."
"But what if it wasn't?"
"So he sent you in his place?"
"What the hell are you doing in your underwear?"
"Of course there is one."
"That's why I brought you here."
"What did you think about it?"
"Do you remember what happened?"
"Your father is much nicer than you."
"Are you referring to the background music?"
"Did I do the right thing by calling the clinic?"
"Or for there to be a collision."
"I did everything you asked."
"I told you we'd get there."
"Did I tell you to do your homework?"
"I'll make you something to eat."
"I know, but I changed my mind."
"He wanted to be loved by all voters."
"What are we supposed to see?"
"She was the one who came up with the idea."
"What's on the top floor?"
"Nobody will mistake us for a real band."
"When did this happen?"
"I don't think it's him."
"She couldn't have gone far."
"She is always late on Monday mornings."
"I thought you'd never ask."
"Does this mean anything to you?"
"He lets me know he's got me."
"Where did you hear that?"
"It was to me that he came."
"Is this what happened?"
"You can be in Miami in five hours."
"They were the ones who came up with the idea."
"It only absorbs what strengthens it."
"What does she have to do with it?"
"Are we ambitious young people in the wind?"
"Everyone has something to hide."
"What did your father say?"
"If you have any questions, come see me."
"I want you to stay here for a while."
"They are harming the wizarding world."
"God has nothing to do with it."
"This is the case for all machines."
"You were talking about a suitcase for all luggage?"
"She said it was an accident."
"Listen to what I have to say to you."
"We are stronger, faster, smarter."
"There is no happy ending."
"She must be in one of those cells."
"You know how to handle women."
"Nina and I apologize, come back."
"I thought you should know."
"What's in the bags?"
"Luther, what can we do?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"I think you are a beautiful couple."
"You know what I mean."
"What stopped you?"
"Haven't you read my resume?"
"Commissioner, what is this all about?"
"Where do they learn to drive?"
"Good God, what is this?"
"What if something had happened to Doug?"
"I have to finish what I started."
"I know what you're going to ask me."
"I give you everything you want."
"I heard you were looking for me."
"What the hell is he doing there?"
"I'm glad you did."
"We must become a person like everyone else."
"I could say I did it."
"All of you, I want to tell you something."
"But what are we doing here?"
"What are you going to give me?"
"You're the one who blocked the barrier."
"We have a riot in B wing."
"Everyone has a role to play."
"They come to us of their own free will."
"Would I ask you if I were married?"
"In my house, we are air signs."
"It's time to tell me everything."
"And that's what scares me."
"Tyrone, what did you do?"
"Everything is going as I planned."
"He was the best samurai in the empire."
"They were the ones who jumped on me."
"No, I didn't have time."
"Is this a good job, FBI agent?"
"Hey, what happened?"
"But what was he thinking?"
"You mean he's from the future?"
"Do you know what the bell thinks about that?"
"You taught me that."
"Your guess is as good as mine."
"Don't tell me you're innocent."
"Harder than you can imagine."
"I told you we were together."
"Tonight he has to have fun."
"I think this is for you."
"Find her a replacement and fulfill your contract."
"This is entirely within my competence."
"First, it is against the constitution."
"Most of them spoke easily."
"I do taxi work part-time."
"You can do whatever you want."
"You wanted to see your father and the dog."
"I have one more favor to ask of you."
"You have to prove it and you will."
"About what happened to Uncle Ben."
"Did you want a ride home?"
"I've never seen so much money."
"I marry him because I love him."
"I'll take care of this myself."
"What are you doing in there?"
"Okay, what's going on here?"
"I've never seen them in my life."
"That's how I got out."
"I hope you have a good lawyer."
"Brought to you by Mr. Tony, over there, you see?"
"My creation to launch and extend the fusion."
"I'm no angel either."
"I'm sure he knows something."
"Now you can see the true beauty of it."
"I'm just giving him a hand."
"You put me here."
"I didn't say goodbye to him."
"Because you are a good person."
"My God, what is happening to us?"
"I thought you might want to know."
"What do you think happened?"
"You put it there."
"You opposed God, your Father."
"What makes you think that?"
"It happened a month ago."
"Can you lend me some money?"
"What is at stake here?"
"Omar tells me a lot of good things about you."
"I was asked to give this to you."
"No, please don't go."
"I reacted the same way when I arrived here."
"From takeoff to landing, we're together."
"What did you do with all my things?"
"What am I supposed to understand?"
"I want what I came for."
"Do you like the guy you're with?"
"They seem to be having a great time."
"That's exactly what they did."
"But I can lie down without a sound."
"I left an hour ago."
"I feel like his son as much as you do."
"What is this thing doing here?"
"I have to say I'm a fan."
"I remember she was screaming in the street."
"What do you have in there?"
"That's what I'm paid for."
"You know what you're doing, I hope."
"This is the hospital, about Linda."
"That's what I want to tell you."
"I served in the Marines, you know."
"I agree if you are."
"I thought you weren't talking to me anymore."
"If you think it's best."
"I'm friends with most of the customers."
"He provides you with everything you want."
"I'm glad to be able to say goodbye to you."
"Let me know if you need anything."
"You weren't allowed to speak?"
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"I give you everything I have."
"I told you to go home."
"Otherwise, the guy is innocent."
"A legion of my best soldiers awaits him."
"That's my way of seeing things."
"I wonder what it's about."
"That's why it's going to work."
"Is this what we smoked yesterday?"
"But what are you telling me?"
"This film is inspired by a true story."
"This film is inspired by a true story."
"I request permission to initiate research."
"I only ask one thing in return."
"Imprint of a revolver barrel above."
"It's such a pleasure to meet you."
"Whether you want to remember it or not."
"And you, what the hell are you doing?"
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"He asked me to come and pick you up."
"What does it take to get your attention?"
"Who would send such a sum, if not the father?"
"Everything you say will stay between us."
"One of you would be on time."
"Who told you I was here?"
"Do you think he lives like the natives?"
"I hope I didn't keep you waiting."
"And this shadow, do you know which one it is?"
"I have something important to tell you."
"Can you describe what happened?"
"Do you live on Robin Hood Lane, the red door?"
"Get in the car, please."
"This guy is family first."
"No, we promised to wait here."
"It's an honor to have you here."
"I understood that my place was there."
"I'm the one asking the questions here."
"She never told me about you."
"It helps to give heart to the fight."
"What do you mean, the way I speak?"
"What did you two talk about?"
"It's a gift from my grandfather."
"It can be cured, but you have to want it."
"The book is on the dashboard."
"Any other week is fine with me."
"I was only able to neutralize one."
"You're the one who came looking for me."
"I just moved near you."
"I see that couples work much better."
"You want it to happen like this."
"Thank him for taking care of me."
"Yes, but I have to take care of them."
"I hope everyone is doing well."
"That's what I heard."
"I'm the one who owes you an apology."
"We'll see who's the strongest."
"Did he tell you that?"
"My wife did it."
"I have the contact, I have the contact."
"Mom, what are we going to do?"
"Who are you and where are you from?"
"Were you voted mother of the year?"
"At least we get a toaster."
"You don't work with rich widows anymore?"
"You and I are going to make the front page."
"We'll make sure you stay healed."
"She was asking for that, you know what I mean?"
"Let him present an invoice for his services."
"Is there anyone up there?"
"I would prefer you not to."
"You wouldn't have left without saying goodbye?"
"This tablet is one of those clues."
"Good, because I love them too."
"My father told me a lot about you."
"I said it was yours."
"He's been doing this for years."
"We drink a coffee and leave."
"That's all they said."
"Then one morning he came to me."
"My angel, you need to rest."
"The master's soul ascended to heaven."
"You do everything I tell you."
"A gift, for the good of humanity."
"Boxing is a game of chess."
"What are you doing in the middle of nowhere?"
"Did they do this to you?"
"I need one with a student."
"What if he makes hay in the country?"
"We can do it, we can achieve it."
"Do you know what that makes you?"
"Would you be so kind as to let me pass?"
"She's not the one they want."
"You must feel the Force around you."
"My husband is the leader of the free world."
"What could possibly be eating away at him?"
"Until you get your sight."
"The best time is the weekend."
"What will it cost me?"
"I expected better from you."
"It's a great day for all of us."
"The officers are watching you to know what to do."
"I understand what the farmers have to go through."
"See you at the meeting point."
"Leave while you still can."
"I wish you had told me about it."
"He was a perfectly respectable man."
"I told you I would."
"Do you mind if I take a look?"
"We need to talk about all this."
"There's only you and me left."
"Do you think your boyfriend will like it?"
"I guess I'm lucky."
"No address, no phone, no money, no time."
"He taught you everything, didn't he, darling?"
"Do you understand what will have to happen?"
"My head is spinning a little."
"That's what we've always done."
"I'll tell you what he wants."
"You're going to fly to Las Vegas."
"I read the Young Deceased Handbook."
"I can't do that either."
"I know what she told me."
"But that was a long time ago."
"I've never seen you around here."
"How do you get flowers like this?"
"Whatever is meant to happen to you, happens to you."
"What else do you know?"
"I think I know what you mean."
"Did you hear what they said?"
"Should I turn each of you into a watch?"
"Who told you we were invited?"
"What else do you have in your pockets?"
"Isn't that what we do?"
"You're about to find out."
"If you want me to leave, just say so."
"Well, what was it?"
"Please, a little respect."
"From here, where do we go?"
"What do you guys want?"
"What's going on between us?"
"You don't have much time left."
"That's where I found her."
"He cut his daughter's hair."
"Mine gave me the big game."
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
"As if we knew what it was."
"Just one, in memory of the good old days."
"Do you think I'll let you do this?"
"I know everything you've done."
"This year has been like a dream."
"This kind of thing happens all the time."
"That's exactly what it means."
"I wish I could do something for you."
"I promise you it won't happen again."
"No, it's not worth it."
"But that's all we have."
"Did you go to the hospital last night?"
"What do you think I'm trying to do?"
"I'm asking you."
"Who gave me this feeling for God?"
"That's all there is to it."
"Did Edison sleep before turning on the light?"
"The last time I saw him."
"The Eagles are in the gallery network."
"I saw her as I see you."
"Tell him the stone is in the office."
"I see you care about this."
"Master, I have something to tell you."
"They don't know what they want."
"He wants me to train in Vegas."
"Did he talk about me?"
"It's always a pleasure to see you."
"Do you know what you just said?"
"It's time to go to work."
"I got everything I wanted."
"Luckily, you have me, and the Deputy Minister."
"What drives you to cinema?"
"That's exactly what I'm going to do."
"That's how he chooses them."
"Are you sure you don't want to come?"
"We can't trust anyone anymore."
"I found out through the usual channels."
"I no longer have the strength to write."
"Is there something you like?"
"Were you expecting someone else?"
"Give us the green light for your friend."
"She wasn't always like this."
"It would take more than two or three samurai."
"If we get lost, it'll be your party."
"That's all the time you'll have."
"Please, do not do that."
"Do you want to be his son's godfather?"
"You will have to tell me everything about my father."
"I need to get some driving done."
"Tell me what you expect from me."
"Then I'll go with someone else."
"I'm telling you, it's heaven."
"I bet yours is bigger."
"I go to school with your daughter."
"You will give life, you will take life."
"One at the lighthouse, the other on the roof."
"I need to speak to you in private."
"Do you have family in the United States?"
"No, I wouldn't want to do that this time."
"I always go to the movies for my birthday."
"This is what all the brothers think."
"I know something that most people don't."
"You're holding the end of that rope there."
"It's a bridesmaid dress."
"A king, a priest and a rich man."
"There is someone in my life."
"I have never loved someone so much."
"That's how I see it."
"How about a nice restaurant with me?"
"Can I know what it is?"
"Can you explain to me what's going on?"

"Yes, you're doing really well."
"You are either with us or with them."
"It's a Wednesday like any other."
"Do you want to be a sheep?"
"I knew we would pay for it one day."
"While he was alive, he cared about living."
"I think we just did it."
"I saw the gentleman in front of the room."
"She was supposed to drop them off at the bank on Friday."
"I know what you're trying to do."
"It says you have to work as a team."
"So I took the afternoon off."
"No, you didn't tell me."
"Can you turn the heat down a little?"
"I have something that might interest you."
"I think I expressed myself badly."
"She goes out with me if her girlfriend comes."
"Wear pretty dresses, have boyfriends."
"Nobody said it was easy."
"I've known him longer than you."
"Haven't you had any migraines recently?"
"And what do you want to do?"
"Where is the Pat-on-the-Back robot?"
"Please let me join him."
"You should have told me you were coming."
"You should have told me you were coming."
"People will be willing to pay big bucks, right?"
"But it's not just him."
"What could have caused this?"
"It's good for business, he said."
"I've made my decision, make yours."
"Much water has flowed under the bridge."
"Would you hold this, please."
"No, it's you who don't understand."
"I want you and your men to leave."
"You have to be there to know."
"I thought it was in my head."
"I will finish what I started."
"Important encounters often happen by chance."
"It will be the same if you don't go."
"She looks more Greek than Italian."
"Go see if the bridge has been cut."
"He will have the courage to do good."
"This must be the gentleman you've been waiting for."
"I come from an honorable samurai family."
"I heard him come in with you others."
"Was I different when you taught me?"
"Pass me my binoculars, please."
"He will be everyone's friend."
"The biggest you've ever had."
"Everyone needs a hobby."
"You'd better go see a psychiatrist."
"I'm glad to see you back on your feet."
"Tell him to put it on my tab."
"Your father is the man who disappeared."
"It's time to tell the truth."
"I have to see my father and his associates."
"You know it wasn't legal."
"Who among you has never sinned?"
"I will give you everything I have."
"I knew you had it in you."
"I swear I don't know."
"Who's really fucked now?"
"But what about Lawrence himself?"
"This is where we met."
"He thinks you're some kind of thief."
"What's so good about it?"
"Does he put food on the table for you?"
"What's going on between you two?"
"That's where I come in."
"We're going to have to do this the old-fashioned way."
"No, to her, if you don't mind."
"What is Mr. Mason's equipment?"
"We had to read throughout the entire film."
"Do you know what you're going to tell them?"
"I had the plan in my head."
"A little rest will do you good."
"Many great people have passed through here."
"Do you know you have beautiful eyes?"
"I have good reason to be."
"I'm the one who takes care of you."
"What do you have against me?"
"And even if he had eaten your friend."
"What are you doing here then?"
"The map shows the exact location of the Grail."
"I can't tell him the truth."
"You have the right to hire a lawyer."
"You don't have any ray guns?"
"I'm a match for him."
"Now they're making a movie about his return."
"Make sure you're not being followed."
"She won't be back until tonight."
"Do you like getting fucked by the king?"
"What are they doing with us?"
"So who are you talking to?"
"They only do what they want."
"He can buy our N.O.C. list."
"Have you ever seen anything like this?"
"You're the one in the ring."
"That's why I'm calling on you."
"I think it's worth it."
"One more thing we have in common."
"What fills me with joy?"
"I'm sure he has his reasons."
"Please don't go back there."
"You wanted to know what the Matrix is?"
"You were like a father to me."
"I remember his face in the rain."
"Don't pay attention, it's the cat."
"I learned to do this when I was a kid."
"What's behind it?"
"Let's see what's in there."
"Can I get you something to drink?"
"I have ice in my glass."
"That's why I came."
"A man can be whatever he wants."
"What are you doing, man?"
"I have to find something honorable."
"Not with everything I've done."
"Because I rented the whole room."
"And what will be my role in all this?"
"I don't give you loads of them, do I?"
"You and I have a lot in common."
"She carries your greatest joy within her."
"I'll pay you next week, I promise."
"A man can do whatever he wants."
"I thought it was you."
"A girl in bed who knows what she's doing."
"Please come home."
"Just tell us what happened."
"What do you want to do then?"
"Do you want to attack someone?"
"It's on the other side of this."
"And this ship allows you to go up there."
"What should I do next?"
"Sorry, did you do this?"
"What are our chances of getting out of here?"
"Do you agree to take this woman as your wife?"
"We have things to do for her."
"I told you not to come."
"Do I have enough credit to buy you out?"
"For the first time, I enjoy it."
"I work, I eat, I have children."
"You haven't changed one bit."
"I'll make sure everything's okay."
"What are you doing here, Dad?"
"Do what you're told."
"What did you tell them?"
"That's all you need to know."
"Have you seen where the world is going?"
"They also say that you work miracles."
"I have a phone call to make."
"I was told you left."
"Mr. Warren, check the bathroom."
"There's going to be some change around here."
"The first from my wife, who was leaving me."
"There are other movies to see."
"This is the life I chose."
"Are they from the hills or the West?"
"I said I'll take care of it."
"It's time for me to go."
"What's so interesting?"
"My mind played tricks on me too."
"How long have you known him?"
"It's nice of you to join us."
"You have to be very brave to name it."
"There may be hope."
"Yes, and a big stone in my bag."
"Happy to be the mother of little saints?"
"But there is something else."
"It is an endangered species."
"Are you saying that to me?"
"I know a spell to turn it yellow."
"I asked you what you were doing."
"This is where you have to start."
"That's what my father said."
"You tell me once, that's enough."
"You don't know me, but I do."
"You saw what you wanted to see."
"Tackle someone your own size."
"How could you leave Dad for him?"
"What did they ask you?"
"She's dumber than I thought."
"What I'm doing."
"That was my grandmother's name."
"It is through you that he will do it."
"There was an impulse that pushed us."
"We can make this work."
"I am looking for someone."
"Where do you think I should take it?"
"You did well to tell me."
"It's beautiful here, isn't it?"
"She mustn't see me like this."
"You must not be involved in this."
"We all deserve a second chance."
"We have more important things to do."
"Because you sell to specific people."
"There's nothing to smile about."
"That's what I should have done."
"I will do you good, very good."
"Is this the movie you wanted to see?"
"I told you not to come here."
"You can ask for whatever you want."
"I needed to talk to someone."
"Because that's what I would do."
"Didn't you think you'd see the Martians one day?"
"I need you for a moment."
"The models we've never seen."
"That's what Billy Glenn would have done."
"They'll be here any minute."
"Was that you on TV this morning?"
"And I take care of my mother."
"You are a great wizard, I assure you."
"I've seen this thousands of times."
"Show what you've got."
"I knew what to expect."
"That's right, you're right to leave."
"Do you have a plan to get out of here?"
"I have to tell you something."
"Give us back the money and take back your caravan."
"Do you need anything else?"
"Now what are we going to do?"
"Sir, do you want to learn the 'Big Apple'?"
"Look at the size of this guy."
"How could I know?"
"All because people think we're cute."
"You never know what to expect."
"But you have to do something for me."
"This is all because of you."
"I want to farm the land, start a family."
"Did you put the stone in the briefcase?"
"Are you sure you don't want anything?"
"This gear is the best of the best."
"Is that something you ate?"
"Everyone is with you, waiting for your signal."
"And when we have it, we will keep it."
"They don't make them like that anymore."
"What do you know about it, woman?"
"I know a bookmaker who will take bets."
"And to make it known to the whole world."
"What is the name of the gentleman you are waiting for?"
"I know he wouldn't mind."
"This is what you always wanted."
"And that's all we have."
"They say a ship is coming this way."
"Maybe he can do something."
"He was the one who came up with the idea."
"How good it is to be so close."
"It looks like someone is there."
"Are you going to tell me what's going on?"
"I'm going to stay here and learn politics."
"They start arguing and yelling."
"Master, we knew it would be so."
"I didn't say anything to Mama."
"This is where God placed you."
"Three tall men are sitting in a room."
"There's enough for all of us."
"This is the love I need."
"You seem to know him well."
"What is he trying to do?"
"I must admit that I thought like them."
"Please put me through to the police."
"I'll put on some music for you."
"Boys' dormitory, upstairs, on your left."
"I told you to keep your distance."
"But what do you know about it?"
"I think we are in the right place."
"Your mother won't arrive for another hour."
"No way you're bringing that thing here."
"How did everyone get drugged?"
"At least, that's what he thought."
"You are indeed your father's daughter."
"Will we ever see him again?"
"I'll make it work."
"And every man needs something."
"Is this how you want to play?"
"He has a great sense of humor."
"Did you expect it to work?"
"We've done this thousands of times."
"That's how I know."
"He is one of those who follow him."
"What do you want me to take off my pants?"
"I'm going to see where that woman has gone."
"I said what I saw."
"Please open your eyes, Donald."
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"I'm going to get him out of his house."
"Can I ask you one last time?"
"We are all one with work."
"Don't you have something to tell us?"
"You have to bring the tiger back anyway."
"Please draw me a sheep."
"Not that it matters."
"I saw that he wouldn't take them."
"It has to look real."
"I had to see this with my own eyes."
"I told you so."
"No time to talk to students."
"I'll get to that after the war."
"I can't tell you about it now."
"I have the right to remain silent."
"See what he's hiding under his fingernails."
"His left hook is truly thunderous."
"Do you remember me from the taxi?"
"So I'll tell you everything at home."
"You just said you love me."
"Maybe we'll still get lucky."
"This is what everyone sees."
"What if I say the right thing?"
"I never know what to expect."
"It's just a friend's house."
"Making money in the name of the Lord."
"It's on the front page of every newspaper."
"All that remains is for us to pray."
"That's what I told myself."
"That's how I like it."
"Succeed and you will get what you want."
"Find out everything you can about him."
"Please make yourself at home."
"What do you mean, Dad?"
"Some are bigger than last year."
"Take steps to keep this information secret."
"You never needed me."
"You'll never guess who he wants to be."
"In my life, I have seen everything."
"Do you think he'll give it back to you?"
"He had bigger breasts than her."
"What else do I have?"
"And here the two children stand up."
"I'm going to town to see the Cup."
"It's bigger than this one, right?"
"Maybe she's waiting for you to speak."
"I read what happened to you."
"I told you what I know."
"I have a Christmas present for you."
"Is that all you did?"
"Is that all you did?"
"I have the same combination on my luggage."
"There is something that intrigues me."
"Do this for me, please."
"I didn't think it was necessary."
"I need some water."
"Is this the man you saw?"
"What's it going to be, Morgan?"
"It is I who must ask your forgiveness."
"I was tired of coconuts."
"Who are all these people in my house?"
"What makes you think that?"
"I saw his body in the morgue."
"I think my husband is having an affair."
"You know it's important to me."
"Tomorrow she's getting married and leaving me."
"There is no question of winning it back."
"I thought we would have more time."
"That's why he won."
"We have quite a lot in common."
"You told everyone about it."
"What is Micky supposed to do?"
"The basement is a whole other world."
"Yes, I saw that on TV."
"Where did they all go?"
"Do you remember our first date?"
"It's good to hear your voice."
"But I want you to know something."
"I knew what had happened."
"We have so much to say to each other."
"I thought she would tell you."
"What did I do to them?"
"Go tell him what I said."
"What do we have in common?"
"Can you give me a hand?"
"I told you to drop those knives."
"If you have the bruises to prove it."
"I want it to stay that way."
"What is everyone looking at?"
"It's hotter than you think."
"You don't need anything else."
"The English claimed not to know him."
"I have the guts to go live."
"The important thing is that I believe you."
"I was wondering what you thought about it."
"If it makes you feel better, I swear it will."
"I have to find out who did this to me."
"Now when I sunbathe, I smile."
"It's time to say goodbye."
"So I'm done with love."
"What's going on in this house?"
"I should have told you a long time ago."
"What pleases him gives me life."
"I need to know what you can do."
"I did what I had to do."
"When you've eaten and slept, you'll be fine."
"I've been waiting for you for an hour."
"You are my son and I love you."
"When should he be taken to a doctor?"
"He has a big stone in his hand."
"Recent events have, however, proved him right."
"No, it's up to you to do it."
"I'll get you a glass of water."
"No, he didn't tell me."
"But believe me, this is the last time."
"Do you know what they did to him?"
"We have the name of their next target."
"If you want to continue with me, talk to me."
"Most people control themselves in society."
"Where is the toy that makes noise?"
"Rome always welcomes young priests of quality."
"We'll meet again after a page of advertising."
"Can I call you back a little later?"
"I am so proud of you, my son."
"Maybe I don't want to know."
"A secret mission off the coast of Scotland."
"It must be one of God's angels."
"That's what must have happened."
"I have family in the United States."
"Should I send the guys to take care of it?"
"I thought you had forgotten me."
"It's time to go to bed."
"I used you to survive."
"It would be easier if I lived here."
"Maybe to give you a nice surprise."
"The creature you carry in your arms?"
"Tell me what happened to Alicia."
"Use live ammunition, we'll take him out."
"There is nothing we can do at the moment."
"Good luck to you and your mother."
"That's what we all want, right?"
"We have created the perfect infiltration machine."
"Want to know what it's all about?"
"I think this is a great idea."
"Be a big boy for Mom and Dad."
"Do you remember our honeymoon?"
"But no, what are you talking about?"
"I was framed."
"I guess he changed his mind."
"I am fluent in six million forms of communication."
"I'm so glad you're here."
"What will happen to this woman?"
"I saw his name on the register."
"You like music, and that's good."
"There's a contract on your head."
"And now, the moment you've all been waiting for."
"Please let me talk to him."
"And that's what she did."
"I'll give you the signal with my handkerchief."
"He says he has great value."
"I want you to be proud of me."
"All I have is Floyd."
"This is the best there is."
"But one of them was very cool."
"The most lasting proof of his genius."
"Don't get it into your head to leave."
"How long has it been since we last saw each other?"
"I wish it had been different."
"I didn't think you were."
"Where did you learn to kiss like that?"
"There's a good reason for rules."
"A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend."
"I know she's strong."
"She didn't have to."
"It's going well, I have some new ideas."
"During the day, that's what I do."
"When he doesn't pay, they cut a piece."
"You can do whatever you want with it."
"I wonder what will happen."
"I even learned this from your friend."
"I hope you are sure of yourself."
"To them, you're a freak show."
"You think it's just inventions."
"I already told the police."
"What's going on, old man?"
"What should I do then?"
"You look like Frankenstein with blond hair."
"What do you think of a beer?"
"He always keeps the key with him."
"I find one every night."
"Who told you that?"
"I would go to the ends of the earth for you."
"What else does he say?"
"We will let ourselves slide to the other side."
"This is the life we chose."
"But what did he say?"
"What happened to your lamb, Clarice?"
"What do we do about it?"
"Spider-Man gets attacked all the time."
"This is the woman you saw."
"What is the common element in all three things?"
"He used the more subtle American formula."
"At the station, with the grass on you?"
"I'm still in FBI school."
"Please don't do this."
"I knew there was a reason."
"If you like men or women."
"And I found myself in his arms."
"But he is also a man of science."
"I'll buy you anything you want."
"She wasn't trained for this."
"The non-interview version airs in two weeks."
"Is that how you talk to me?"
"You are the only one who can do it."
"I try to do what is right."
"Let's take these boys to their little party."
"It took me a little while."
"These things last a quarter of an hour."
"I didn't say a word to him."
"I know what you're going to ask me."
"But he has to water Paulie every week."
"You know I can't say anything."
"I've never seen one so big."
"There is something to be done."
"My whole life has led me to this."
"Instead, try to realize the truth."
"She told me to give this to you."
"I think a decoration should be recommended."
"Are you on the Elvis article?"
"No orders have yet arrived from Rome."
"I went to school in Cairo."
"The trick is knowing when and how."
"How happy he can make them."
"Your boy is coming with me to social services."
"I had to execute him with my pistol."
"They come in all colors."
"I understand how you paid for this."
"There is a way out."
"The dog looks the same as him."
"Do you think you're in charge?"
"I bet it's a good move."
"The press is free for those who control it."
"We heard about it on the radio."
"Can I know what happened?"
"Those who wish to go up, press the lever."
"What arrangements have you made for the injured?"
"Do you want to know your real mothers and fathers?"
"I barely saw them anyway."
"I told you the day would come."
"I have the right to say nothing."
"Some are because of the storm."
"This is a golden opportunity for you."
"No, he's not well at all."
"I bet you didn't know that."
"Do you think we think about the future?"
"Promise me, and I'll tell you later."
"There are some who are leaving."
"I dreamed I was a Jedi."
"The Navy has other fish to fry."
"We have a great nation, a free press."
"I have all the reinforcements I need."
"I do what you taught me."
"I'm going to listen to Tony Bennett records."
"May the Lord grant us a happy journey."
"What do you know about him?"
"Tell me I found something."
"There is a notch all the way to the top."
"That's all I can offer."
"He told You-Know-Who."
"I always dreamed of having one."
"There's a big red guy down there."
"Your memory is erased and you are freed."
"What awaits us up there?"
"I thought you might be interested."
"Not everything went as planned."
"It's a snakeskin jacket."
"I need it as soon as possible."
"Would you like me to make us some tea?"
"That's why we love you."
"It's the least we can do."
"Because I don't want to."
"Her heart-shaped jewelry box."
"That's what you did to him."
"You got out early because of me."
"Do you still have friends in the police?"
"There is coffee in the kitchen."
"You're putting all that in the ring now."
"He wasn't just a tough guy."
"That's what I'm talking about."
"But if we get high we'll screw up."
"I know you will make the right choice."
"Tobacco will do everything to prevent it."
"I told you to take care of it."
"What are you going to tell them?"
"Is it good for sunburn?"
"I've already found a baby once."
"Will a warrant be required to speak to him?"
"It is clear that security is maximum."
"Yeah, that's what I meant."
"Apparently he's a good boxer."
"I have everything I need."
"It could be either."
"I tell you I saw it."
"Didn't I already tell you?"
"We are part of an ancient secret society."
"God did not create men equal."
"I want something in that vein."
"Good God, what's going on?"
"So who is this character that comes back to me?"
"It's easy for you to say."
"It will be for their pleasure, so to speak."
"What do you have on you?"
"They can grow whatever they want."
"America has heard the clarion call."
"No, I couldn't catch it."
"Could you give me something sweet?"
"They only feed on living flesh."
"Welcome everyone and thank you for coming."
"I will give you the man who knows them."
"No, I've never heard of it."
"In South Africa, there were few of us."
"Go rest, I'll stay with him."
"I think you're at five."
"I said it would be the truth."
"I think I can handle it."
"What are you doing in town?"
"Haven't you tried making movies?"
"I'm not sure about that either."
"Can you translate English and French?"
"No, but what do I look like?"
"What does this mean to you?"
"Do you have anything to do with this?"
"Do you have anything to do with this?"
"I hope nothing happened to him."
"Did you see what you did?"
"What do you think about it?"
"He thinks he can get away with anything."
"How can you trust him more?"
"There is another passage through there."
"I've heard good things about you."
"I'm going to risk everything."
"Your dad was a pastor at the Baptist church."
"I'm going to be late for the hearing."
"And you, what are you doing?"
"Sometimes believing is all we have left."
"They have nothing else to do."
"He knows more than you think."
"I think some thanks would be in order."
"Everything will be fine, I promise."
"That's all she wrote."
"The little one is completely different."
"Let us walk, let us walk on the path to freedom."
"What are you doing out there?"
"You have to finish what you started."
"Do you think he didn't touch anything?"
"How did you feel when you saw it, Clarice?"
"God willing, around noon."
"What do you think you're doing here?"
"You have one minute to finish these plates."
"Please, this is very important."
"Infiltrate, find a target, and bring it back to us."
"It seems to be going well."
"That's the last thing I would do."
"What did they tell you?"
"One for the airport, the other for Moscow."
"I will take back what is mine."
"The air we breathe is perfectly harmless."
"Mom, nothing's going on in there."
"Can you find out if they know anything?"
"We have the means to make you talk."
"Luckily Sugar Ray wasn't there."
"What do you think happened?"
"You may have heard of me."
"I'm in the same situation, you see."
"Put your mark at the bottom of the page."
"This is how we greet each other."
"This time, you caught it well."
"Please turn around for me."
"I just wanted to tell you myself."
"Do I have time to go to the bathroom?"
"What exactly is he doing?"
"Tell me now, please."
"I hope that's still the case."
"I think we'll take a look."
"I want a home, children, peace."
"Well, I hope I was right."
"The Vatican knows nothing about these shareholders."
"I was told he was there."
"The future is our time."
"Before, she might have let us do it."
"There is strength in you."
"I thought I was going to die."
"And I knew his father was a psychiatrist."
"I think you forgot the mask."
"You have enormous responsibilities in this mission."
"Is it a special costume you're looking for?"
"You have to do this kind of thing."
"I saw something inexplicable too."
"I need to speak to you in private."
"Anyway, he knows where to find me."
"I need some space."
"Are we on our way to the same place?"
"This could be the end of Spider-Man."
"The Pope himself must give his approval."
"I need you more than ever."
"What do you mean by that?"
"I got what I came for."
"You want to see my son, is that it?"
"Do you know what I think of you?"
"I'll call you if I find anything."
"You wanted us to move here."
"What took so long?"
"Do you know the difference between you and me?"
"He always fought against both."
"And then something happened."
"Bandits who sell themselves to the highest bidder."
"The important thing is that you are here."
"Nobody saw it coming at all."
"Maybe it's just a coincidence."
"He is skillful, bold, and kind-hearted."
"There are women and children."
"A pretty name for a pretty little girl."
"About a month ago."
"What are you doing, little Micky?"
"You should get the raise next month."
"What should no one know?"
"She believes what she has been taught."
"Did you lock her in the sauna or something?"
"Did I do something?"
"He's the only one who can do it."
"I'm telling you that you've already won."
"And that's what you're going to do."
"You all came to the same conclusion."
"I even have some for you, my friend."
"What happened there?"
"That's what you want to hear, right?"
"And what can I do?"
"We are glad we were able to be of service."
"Maybe she's just different from the others."
"What could you have done?"
"I have a call on the other line."
"I thought there were more."
"You need a key to open this book."
"I first tried to free them."
"It will be good to come back a free man."
"Vinnie, not too many onions in the sauce."
"What's going on, brother?"
"They will soon be safe in Atlanta."
"There must be a mechanism somewhere."
"I'm the man you need."
"I hope this serves as a lesson to you."
"There must be something in there."
"You can do whatever you want to me."
"Ambrose and his men crossed the bridge."
"I think I had one."
"Do you know what they can do to you?"
"She's just a girl in my class."
"It's all the same to me."
"What can you tell us?"
"Captain Daniels, please report to the infirmary."
"Someone forwarded our mail to you."
"This is what happened, my dear."
"She leads you by the nose."
"Are there any messages for me?"
"Do you want a dance in the VIP room?"
"If we survive, can we go home?"
"No one has seen him for three weeks."
"What are you still doing here?"
"I think it's time to go."
"I promised you three hours in advance."
"And you give a princess to his son?"
"But I have to see you, boss."
"No, I don't want anything more from this house."
"Congress leaders are selling them in Delhi."
"Who wants to go there?"
"What if I don't make it?"
"Do you think there is a connection?"
"Don't you have a plane to catch?"
"You should never have come there."
"I only use it for certain things."
"What I have to do to see him again."
"What do you think of her?"
"What's yours is mine."
"I wonder what you are doing here."
"What looks perfect?"
"She looks just like an angel."
"I have no way of knowing."
"Tell me what else you like."
"I was asked to go up and see him."
"I guess you have to get up early."
"Tell me, what do you want?"
"I thought you'd run away."
"You're going to have to do this at home."
"Are you sure it's this way?"
"They are heading towards a landing point."
"I didn't expect that from you."
"I did the best I could."
"Going straight ahead, we reach the land."
"What did you want to show me?"
"There is everything we want."
"He is the key to the future, to the past."
"I'm preparing dinner."
"No, I don't see where he could be."
"Act as if nothing happened."
"She has no idea."
"I need to talk to you for a minute."
"But people don't always accept them."
"Don't you want to kiss your old friend Santos?"
"I never asked myself the question."
"Where did you learn to talk like that?"

"I have a recording of his beautiful organ."
"Even in love, it is better to be chosen."
"Search the recesses of your soul, Clarice Starling."

"That's what my grandfather used to say."
"Did you see what I saw?"
"Don't you want to end up at McDonald's?"
"That's exactly what I want to know."
"Where are you going like this?"
"Did you really do that to yourself in basketball?"
"If you saw what Bobby can do."
"Have you ever crossed the street without looking?"
"I need you to tell me."
"Are you going to tell me?"
"I've always wanted to do this."
"Either way, we're all going to stay there."
"But you need it more than we do."
"I'll give him a hand."
"One hundred dollars a day to stay at your house."
"It's quite a story, I'll tell you."
"He was the one who found the body."

"How many of you had domestic parents?"
"It's good to see you back."
"This is where we spend most of our time."
"At least, that's what he says."
"Sorry I didn't come sooner."
"Mom, what happened?"
"That's all we have."
"My work could have had a positive effect."
"I've been thinking about it since I've been here."
"No, I haven't found them yet."
"Please check and tell me."
"How about giving us a nice smile?"
"Can I get you a cup of tea?"
"You tell him what he wants to hear."
"I had to get rid of him."
"Is this the man you saw?"
"A chance I never had."
"The master asks you for red ink."
"And waited for the police while smoking his cigar?"
"Looks like he's at the end of his rope."
"They act as if nothing happened."
"I said it, it was a man."
"Is that any way to treat a friend?"
"Their security systems have spotted you, sir."
"I have given orders to this effect."

"A little longer and she could have."
"I think something is going on."
"Did she really say she's pregnant?"
"Oh, what do I see there?"
"It's time to go to work."
"You know, confiding is a good thing."
"I was when we met."
"Thank you for taking the time to meet with me."
"As if the two were in intimate communication."
"Maybe it's a love story."
"One of my lab turtles survived."
"If this is true, we will take it into account."
"You don't get seasick?"
"I knew you would come to my rescue."
"I'm glad you liked it."
"I know, but I don't want to."
"I told you about these English laws."
"When do you think it will all be revealed?"
"I wish we had more time."
"You know what I think of him."
"What never happened?"
"Hold this girl for me, please."
"Because he would have to reveal everything in court."
"The debate is raging across the planet."
"Customers and some employees left yesterday."
"Is there any chance of broadcasting the interview?"

"White does the same to white."
"It speaks of night and day."
"You need it much more than I do."
"I want a lock of Mom's hair."
"You are my brother and I love you."
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"You have your secrets, I have mine."
"It would be better to cancel this party, right?"
"Who do you think you are?"
"Have you ever played this, Big Boss?"
"What did you get into me?"
"I didn't expect that either."
"Do you know any stories about our fathers in the past?"

"As if I had seen myself in a dream."
"Do you think we're going to leave like this?"
"Have you made any progress?"
"You mean we fought?"
"Most people don't know this."
"Explain to him that my world is closed to you."
"I know what's going on here."
"I'll try to find you some clothes."
"It may be over for Micky Ward."
"I live my life as I see fit."
"What could have happened to him?"
"He is the last prince of the galaxy."
"Is that why you consulted?"
"What is he to you?"
"We have to make do with what we have."
"When was the last time you spoke to him?"
"I know what caused the war."
"I think we're going to have fun."

"But now let us take care of her."
"That's what happens when you leave."
"She is indeed her father's daughter."
"This is what you will do for me."
"This is more your area than mine."

"But what are you saying?"
"I stopped by Josie's after work."
"This is the most I can do."
"You play eight, right?"
"This continued late into the night.'"
"That's exactly what you said."

"Not everyone has spoken yet."
"It stopped after New Year's."
"I will repay you the principal and interest."
"We're both going to have fun."

"What is he going to do to us?"
"You taught me everything in life."
"You are my connection to real life."
"It's good because it's you."
"Is there a phone on this level?"
"And this probability is expressed in this way."
"How many times do I have to say this?"
"It was the only option I had."
"I got it for a good price."
"I would prefer something else, but it's nourishing."

"There is movement in the courtyard."
"Do you want to see the rest of the house?"

"He was bound to draw attention to himself."
"Please answer the question."
"So what should we do?"
"I want to know everything about you."
"Because it wouldn't be a surprise anymore."
"I am delighted to have you among us."
"I devour all the animals in the forest."
"This place must be a gold mine."
"And this is where it gets interesting."
"So what do you want to do?"
"It's like I don't exist."
"Do you think he's involved in this?"
"You have to talk to him, that's your role."
"Go from place to place, meet people."
"Can I ask what you do?"

"What is this place?"
"Hey, what's going on here?"
"You said he wouldn't come."
"You have no purpose in life."
"There was an incident in China."
"I need you in my life."
"Maybe he was an early riser."
"What's that on your wrist?"

"Do you want to know how I got them?"
"Do you ever see anyone you like here?"
"I can love, have children, live, grow old."
"Do you know what they told me?"
"You will tell me what you think."

"I'll be back in half an hour."
"Some ID, please?"

"Can you tell me what's going on?"
"What is he going to do to her?"
"What did he do with his sons?"
"Yes, my father had it made for me."
"What are we still doing here?"
"Do you have any idea what you're doing?"
"She needed a little TLC."
"This is going to be a long distance call."
"This is the best thing that could happen."
"There must be eight of my father's cups left."
"Not even on your doorstep."
"I've always wanted to tell you something."
"I got you a seat upstairs."
"It's all because of me."
"Let's hope he remained loyal to the Chancellor."
"I told you I was in a hurry."
"I think there is something."
"Is there any mail for me?"
"I would give you a very good price for it."
"No, it's not at all."
"We will be delighted to have a moment of relaxation."
"What happened here?"
"It's been in my family for generations."
"Is that how you see yourself?"
"But I want you to respect his decision."
"I know you will make the right choice."
"I'd better go see him."
"I actually have a proposition to make to you."
"It's a miracle you came."
"I was this close to doing it."
"Let them know what is at stake."
"No news of Skywalker or Solo."
"I definitely need to do more."
"Hold on for a few days, until I get back."
"Ariel, we'll follow the backup plan."
"Is this how you serve your City?"
"I could eat a million and a half of them."
"Let me show you where you'll be working."
"I told him I would talk to you."
"Then one day something happened."
"Maybe you have some left in reserve?"
"You remember, with soybeans."
"No, I know what I saw."
"I saw the ramp coming out of there."
"As the Romantic poets often observed."
"What made them come?"
"Do you remember his last name?"
"I say what I think too often."
"This is a chance to increase your salary."
"You don't want to show me your face?"
"For someone from another planet, yes."
"She doesn't mean what she says."
"I've never seen anything like this in my life."
"What interests me is my daughter."
"And I saw you on TV."
"You never know what he's thinking."
"This is wing B. Where are we going?"
"I have something interesting to tell you."
"I must have heard you call it that."
"You can heat them up and eat with him."
"In return, protect her with all your might."
"I know what's going to happen."
"I told you from the beginning."
"Guys, what's going on?"
"I told you, I don't know."
"Please excuse me for a moment."
"Even if they didn't know it yet."
"See if they have a stretcher at the police station."
"I think I have to go."
"Let's wait until the rain has passed before leaving."
"The Barbarians are practically at the gates of Rome."
"What would a doctor tell me?"
"The guys at Bar-T took it."
"We have a civil war in the section."
"He is responsible for everything and everyone."
"You need to talk to your father."
"I think we just found it."
"My answer is go ahead, let them try."
"Did you know that Cleopatra is pregnant by Caesar?"
"I was in high school when they sold."
"What are we going to do then?"
"I must pick up the debris of a world."
"Did she tell you where she was going?"
"And the man who called the store?"
"He comes from a farm in the valley."
"Those who are willing to do that, yes."
"My factory manager is on this train."
"Looks like you cut off our pension."
"It's a strawberry cough."
"Was it me who wanted to see you?"
"I have tampons for anyone who wants them."
"What are we going to do?"
"It's the beginning of a new life."
"People have the right to their privacy."
"This is my grandmother's ring."
"That's what you said, right?"
"What if you tried not to pay?"
"Are we going to see the Bruce Lee movie?"
"Who told you I have one?"
"Between noon and the time of the assassination."
"Do you hear what I said to you?"
"She took the same bus as us."
"You just need a little time."
"He kept his rations for six weeks."
"I've had your wallet all this time."
"She likes knowing that Mom is up there."
"And what is she doing there?"
"I took the rest of the box."
"King, where did you get those beers, kid?"
"So what am I going to do?"
"I would like you to do me a favor."
"I placed my cool hand on his forehead."
"I've done it before, I can do it again."
"You know as much as many priests."
"She left me and is asking for a divorce."
"I brought it for you guys."
"They were lucky to have you."
"He wants to enjoy the spotlight."
"Give me a chance to prove it to you."
"That's what I usually do."
"Who said it was a man?"
"There is one in the room."
"People are willing to do anything to survive."
"I'm sure he loves you too."
"Let's enter this way and then go straight ahead."
"With a personal touch: a motion detector."
"You will be like his father and mother."
"Introduce people by giving valuable information."
"I will let you know my decision."
"And you know what I thought?"
"Who do you think they're fighting for?"
"It'll take more than a compass, Englishman."
"I am carrying a child from another line."
"Looks like someone came here."
"We'll put it in the bathroom."
"He has helped me since I arrived here."
"Is that why we are feared?"
"Because I can't have you."
"They went to the restaurant and to the cinema."
"I showed the diamond to three experts."
"Looks like I have a plan?"
"Are you talking about yourself in the third person?"
"I was told she was here."
"Remember those men with the guns?"
"Maybe we can agree."
"You know you want it."
"He's got some Mars stuff down there."
"Please, make it quick."
"Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me."
"Haven't I already told you?"
"Haven't I already told you?"
"You know what everyone loves?"
"Do you remember what happened?"
"Did Jim call the press?"
"If he's chasing girls, we know it."
"Sorry to keep you waiting so long."
"She no longer has the will to live."
"What if it was really just a dream?"
"I had to say what I knew."
"It took a long time to get to the title."
"I don't think he's here."
"You have a curious sense of humor."
"I can talk to Agatha, if you want."
"There must be an exit through there."
"You see that these curtains don't open well."
"There is no better one."
"I'll finish what you started."
"I thought it was over, but no."
"And that I will see my first nephew soon."
"Send as many men as we can."
"He retired last year."
"I have a duty to fulfill towards him."
"This is our uncle's house."
"I'll make sure she knows."
"They want us to think they are bears."
"All in one butt, or all over the place?"
"See you at the press conference."
"I couldn't stop thinking about it."
"And they thought we were going to believe it all?"
"That's good, what you did."
"I always wanted to buy one."
"If you sign it, I can go."
"You can sit here if you want."
"One day on land, ten years at sea."
"Is this face because of me?"
"So what do we do now?"
"Maybe he wants to spend the night there."
"Would you like a glass of cold lemonade?"
"Do you know what's going on up there?"
"How did Bishop know she was there?"
"For what you did to Ned."
"Are you sure it's this way?"
"I thought you might like to keep this."
"There is a path, and a staircase."
"No, you don't need that."
"It's an idea I had."
"Tell me what you think of her."
"What I said is our contract."
"Such moments require an act of faith."
"How about a game of chess?"
"What's wrong with your eyes?"
"Make us a list, we'll go for you."
"You're not who you say you are?"
"You wiped the rim of the cup."
"But I have to talk to my father about this."
"I wish you good luck in the police force."
"Thank you for what you are trying to do."
"That's how it all works."
"I chose to be a good guy."
"The rest areas have extra showers."
"You know what would go well with this?"
"We finally agree on something."
"Everyone sleeps with everyone."
"So what are you doing here?"
"He can ask her whatever he wants."
"And I was curious to see your reaction."
"Please get us out of here."
"Steven, maybe we should get out of here."
"With his marble head, he does so."
"Is it possible for you to record a message?"
"And what is he going to do?"
"You may have to answer for perjury."
"You don't have to answer me."
"Because of the seriousness of the situation."
"Did you put your name in the Cup?"
"Knights who say 'Ni' demand a sacrifice."
"If you're listening, I guess so."
"Most people will never know."
"At the end of the shipment I receive payment."
"Don't you know me better than that?"
"You are just a mountain monkey."
"Maybe it's because of the dive."
"Who knows what the future holds?"
"The new bucket and the cleaning lady."
"I need a picture for the newspaper."
"How did it go with the shrink?"
"Tell me you have good news."
"Who has seen one in a hundred years?"
"How could this happen?"
"That you know the meaning of the word gratitude."
"The world is more beautiful from here."
"I forgot the name of the church."
"What do you love most in life?"
"Together on this one, like real friends."
"That would explain his connection to little Hammond."
"He was five when I moved in."
"Yes, it is next to their camp."
"What do they care?"
"There's a mole among the cops."
"Is this a game or a test, Sergeant?"
"Sugar daddy's going to make art, honey."
"How do machines know what wheat tastes like?"
"I'm just a bundle of nerves."
"Apparently I have great potential."
"There is a person in my closet."
"It's more of a manhunt."
"You are one of them now."
"I see you right now, Norma."
"There were a total of four suitcases."
"Do you remember what we did?"
"Remember what I taught you."
"I feel like I'm going around in circles."
"I want people to know the truth."
"There is a cupboard behind this desk."
"I'll catch him before he gets there."
"The colonists will make perfect test subjects."
"I'll tell you what I believe."
"Who doesn't spend a lot of time there?"
"She stayed in bed for months."
"I think I can make you happy."
"Most people have other priorities."
"I didn't like him anyway."
"And that's when I understood."
"What will the Admiral decide about you?"
"You saw it with your own eyes."
"My parents took me to see this painting."
"They asked me a lot of questions."
"Could I have a word with Mr. Benedict?"
"This is about me."
"How long has it been since I saw you?"
"The more I fought, the more powerful he became."
"I hope it's not too much."
"My God, what's happening to me?"
"What's going on in your head?"
"We talk about it on his deathbed?"
"Did you see what I saw?"
"The Chancellor has entrusted me with an important mission."
"I'm going to my studio for a while."
"I didn't expect all this."
"We owe it to the samurai."
"You should take a look at it."
"I only trust your brother."
"I found your ticket in your room."
"I've been looking for you all afternoon."
"I've been looking for you all afternoon."
"Perhaps to my superior, General Y."
"He will do whatever you need."
"I think there is one."
"I'm here because I love you."
"Can I see her, please?"
"There are only children here."
"Do you know the young woman's name?"
"We need to clear this up."
"He's fast enough for you, old man."
"I will do whatever you tell me."
"I'm the one who brought him here."
"Not on political economy anyway."
"The other Jennifer is coming home at this time."
"They must have seen the flames in Georgetown."
"Before midnight, I will find a beautiful night."
"Do other people's disabilities make you laugh?"
"Can't we have some privacy?"
"I tried to be a good mother."
"Do you want to know where they all went?"
"What is a 'know-how mark'?"
"It seems that this will be a memorable evening."
"Please get out of your vehicle."
"It's my turn to say no."
"You're just a movie star."
"I never say the right thing."
"At the edge of the first ridge line."
"You received the money last month."
"See what he knows about this Batman."
"You are free to leave whenever you want."
"That's good, what you did."
"Here you see the first stage of development."
"Maybe they were there, always."
"I have something better for you."
"That's all I need to know."
"Do you know what a raw material is?"
"That's how the system works."
"My powers have doubled since we last met."
"With carpet and a goldfish."
"I had never heard anything like it."
"Although I am a foreigner, I offer you my condolences."
"I heard he was great."
"Even when the ladies leave the toilet bowl down."
"You came all this way for this?"
"I wish she had told me."
"One people who will live in peace."
"The pieces that everyone can take."
"So people like you can vote."
"And what are they doing?"
"I bought you a brand new one."
"I should be the one doing the saluting."
"There's someone who wants to see you."
"You have to go down to get to the car."
"Don't you ever leave me again."
"What do you want from us?"
"Do what you want to do."
"This is my grandfather's watch."
"I think I'm starting to get good at it."
"But someone didn't think so."
"Unlike others, I have an opinion."
"And what are you doing here?"
"I cared about you too, in my own way."
"What's going on here, old man?"
"I'll see what our visitors want."
"You have what it takes to succeed."
"I'll tell you what I would do."
"For this, we must pull together."
"Do you know why we make a good team?"
"You seem like a good guy."
"I read something about this."
"I think we can trust him."
"It's a lifeline that we throw to him."
"I need a big picture."
"As soon as he releases the Declaration, we intervene."
"Can't we control it remotely?"
"By the way, you really rocked it there."
"What do we do at the office?"
"I didn't expect to hear from you."
"You mean I'm adapting?"
"I have absolute confidence in these men."
"The sun is shining, it's a beautiful day."
"What can't you do?"
"I think it has a future."
"Go anywhere, but not that way."
"I was sure it came from there."
"One of them found the map."
"Every day it's the same thing."
"We have lots of things to do."
"Someone has beheaded the Baron's cabbages."
"I think that's an accurate description."
"What do you know about her?"
"You have your beliefs, but respect ours."
"You know I love cinema."
"A rich kid, raised by maids."
"I need to find out about them."
"I'm surprised she still employs you."
"These are the answers I need."
"Did you spend New Year's Eve with your parents?"
"I have nowhere else to go."
"This is his only way to follow us."
"I gave him what he wanted."
"There is one in every story."
"You said it would take two years."
"How long did you last?"
"We'll let the artillery do some work."
"The world is a huge treasure island."
"Until he went solo."
"Are you the one who blocked the doors?"
"That's what makes it an obsession."
"She thought she was the boss with you."
"Turn left, there is a town."
"What do you want me to do with this?"
"Are you being paid for this information?"
"Wait for a guy named Griff to arrive."
"Yes, if that's what you want."
"Do you want to come to Las Vegas with me?"
"I'm not who they think I am."
"Had you finished cutting his hair?"
"But that's all I know."
"I assure you I will win it."
"I never even knew his real name."
"It is our most powerful radio transmitter."
"Stiffer than a chocolate bar, boss."
"High-level functions, in combat positions."
"It was a pleasure meeting you."
"You've got a good plan here, you know?"
"I'm so lucky to have you."
"What man trades a life for a ship?"
"Could you call me a number in Hollywood?"
"It's amazing what you find in this casino."
"Isn't she beautiful?"
"Which political camp are you on, Mr. Hughes?"
"But it was the right thing to do."
"There's still someone on the ground."
"I congratulate you on receiving this blessing."
"Do you agree to take this man as your husband?"
"Kim, this is Edward, he's going to live with us."
"And all the shrimp you can eat."
"What else do I have to offer you?"
"I swear it won't happen again."
"Since it's the market, let's go to the market."
"He has so many things to take care of."
"That's what she told me."
"I thought I was being asked for on the phone."
"You are the last supporter of their religion."
"What did he show you?"
"He was three or four times my size."
"I can tell you who will be the last one."
"Can I have the number of the yellow taxis?"
"Because he's your son, they say."
"They only get what they deserve."
"We only see clearly with the heart."
"Tell my second in command to take command."
"Did you hear something on the radio?"
"I'm an hour from my office."
"I know a little about history."
"That's how I like to do it."
"Can you spell it, please?"
"Are you the one who found the ear?"
"My people have learned to do without it."
"He took that guy's wallet."
"That's where we met."
"The face, the eyes, the fingers, the breasts."
"I told you to get rid of it."
"It's a pretty simple basic principle."
"This is a gift I'm giving you."
"What brought you here?"
"Did you deliver this plane to the army?"
"I've never seen anything like it."
"But remember, you have friends here."
"Do you want to tell me what you're doing?"
"You remember that, don't you?"
"I can give you a few dollars to move."
"You did a great job in the play."
"You will do as you are told."
"But what do we have here?"
"I didn't hear anything with the noise."
"Is that where you met Oswald?"
"Do you want me to make things easier for you?"
"If there is fog, they will come."
"It's good to see you back."
"That's what you have to do, right?"
"Nobody knows what that means."
"That's exactly what we did."
"We must respect your father's wishes."
"She thinks it will do me good."
"We must end this once and for all."
"Are we still seeing each other later?"
"They told me to come see you."
"You'll give this to the kids on occasion."
"You need to discuss this with the accounting department."
"I started with cars, motorcycles."

"She's a friend of mine from the club."
"I have to go to the loft, to my lab."
"I was gone for almost an hour."
"You better tell me the truth."
"Did you do something to your hair?"
"No, I never go to town for that."
"Do you want to know what that means?"
"He says we would make a good team."
"I hope it's worth it."
"I hope it's worth it."
"I only found out last night."
"I'm so glad you're here."
"It will give me something to think about, in any case."
"What does that make him?"
"Do Mom and Dad know about Tony?"
"Do you have a picture of your girlfriend?"
"You see, he actually turned red."
"The gateway to Southeast Asia."
"How did it come to this?"
"He was shot in the chest."
"This place gives me the creeps."
"I was checking to see if you were being followed."
"This is what he wanted me to discover."
"Not that anyone cares."
"I did this to him."
"They will see that this time we are ready."
"But that was years ago."
"How long has it been since we did this?"
"That's all they took."
"Something happened between us."
"I'll be fine as soon as I can lie down."
"She's not what you think."
"We have a double mortgage on the house."
"I am going to France to assert our rights."
"Did he bring you up to his room?"
"An invention that has never been proven?"
"Can we turn around to the USA?"
"How dare you enter this holy place?"
"There are others around here."
"You were fine two weeks ago."
"I have a good contract right now."
"I want to be reunited with my wife and children."
"I promise to read no more porn books."
"I have never loved anyone so much."
"Tell him the truck has been returned."
"Isn't that what you do?"
"Remember what you said."
"I said I wanted to talk to you."
"I will make a statement to the press."
"We had more and more audience."
"And Joanna is coming by later."
"Do you know what this is going to cost me?"
"I have something you must see."
"He will have the queen's apartments prepared."
"It is the most suitable for this work."
"It is a tradition in Chinese culture."
"What do you want in return?"
"What is it, anyway?"
"I've never seen him with anyone."
"Stuart only saw his white pants."
"What will he find there, doctor?"
"You think I can't read."
"Stay and have a drink with Bridget and me."
"I thought my life was over."
"That's where I saw her."
"What else do you want me to say?"
"Who else have you told?"
"The chase is now in the air."
"It was just a set-up."
"In the dream, I was in a house."
"I have a lot of work at the moment."
"I think you should go."
"He's getting too attached to you and Bobby."
"Did you like it as much as I did?"
"Only the truth and nothing but the truth."
"I have to say I find it fascinating."
"Where is the girl who wore that watch?"
"I think it's the right time."
"I haven't heard that in a long time."
"What can you tell me about him?"
"Real butter like when I was little."
"What did you say your name was?"
"Say these words clearly and in order."
"I'm fine, Mom, I assure you."
"A planet where apes descended from men."
"When in fact, you are his friend."
"So we need to talk about this."
"What do you think happened?"
"I heard what you said."
"I think the suit is too tight."
"What exactly is the purpose of your mission?"
"For the kind of aircraft we know."
"Are you involved in the riot?"
"You, what did you do?"
"Is that where you found it?"
"She knew how to see beauty in others."
"From Panama to Southeast Asia."
"I hope you do a good job."
"This is the fun part, I'm getting there."
"This is the one I told you about."
"This is the one I told you about."
"Your son was very brave, Mrs. Collins."
"I'm glad you could come."
"I think they went that way."
"So, I made a phone call."
"She was probably at her wit's end."
"Do you think I did it on purpose?"
"Some people are lucky."
"There were three spies in that cabin."
"That's what you wanted, right?"
"That's what you wanted, right?"
"And what should I know?"
"I'm one step ahead of you."
"Can't you think of anything else?"
"I have one last thing to tell you."
"What else do you want me to do?"
"I have five like him at home."
"You want to know what I did?"
"Hang on to me and the agenda."
"What you tell them is your business."
"He must be doing something."
"What's your brother's truck doing outside?"
"You've had this ring long enough."
"Could you be a friend to a girl?"
"What if we saw each other, with the children?"
"I've been waiting for you to ask for so long."
"You are lucky to have a bonus."
"What about the colonies to the north?"
"I have a drink here, do you want one?"

"She would do the same to me if she could."
"Rome was charged with enforcing his will."
"I don't know, but it's possible."
"This is my life and this is who we are."
"I have a feeling it's him."
"A businessman like you will understand."
"He took the two droids with him?"
"Can you turn around, please?"
"It's three o'clock in the afternoon."
"Who has the power to cover up the affair?"
"No, that's not what I want."
"I went to Spain last month."
"There is always a chance to learn."
"It's just a game to him."
"He seems like a nice guy."
"Have you ever written a wrestling movie?"
"It's just you and me now."
"And now what do I do?"
"You can have as many as you want."
"In more than one way, including a serious one."
"What do you want me to do for you?"
"Come on, Annette will take all four of us."
"He wants you to tell him everything tomorrow."
"Taking pictures of the night sky, for example."
"I hope I'm not waking you up."
"I told you how I felt."
"Go back upstairs right away and get dressed."
"He wants us to pay for the beer."
"Casey is my neighbor in English class."
"I'll call you back as soon as it's finished."
"How about we go bowling after dinner?"
"Yesterday I saw you walking towards me."
"Is that why everything is recorded?"
"This is how it should be."
"I thought you wanted to see the Elves."
"I thought your people had become legendary."
"I'm just a little warm, that's all."
"What happened in this room?"
"I think we should draw lots."
"I hope you learned your lesson."
"Maybe we should keep watch."
"I want a nice deployment this time."
"These underwear are a gift from my wife."
"You didn't answer my phone."
"There is a dinosaur in the garden."
"So I thought I'd ask his opinion."
"A glass of water, please."
"I heard the news on the radio."
"I can give you my answer right now."
"But join us in doing this."
"We have plenty of space behind the house."
"Now get out before we see you."
"I didn't think you would."
"A man who always dreamed of independence."
"I heard what she said."
"So, what is the idea to sow?"
"Maybe she came to eat here."
"What is the expression I am looking for?"
"I know the New England accent."
"Can you give us a hand?"
"I have little time left to live."
"This marriage is null in the eyes of Rome."
"Whatever happens, God bless him."
"I might need it one day."
"The search for the missing plane has begun."
"Please give me the little one."
"This is the second person to be shot dead in twenty years."
"Is it because of the other night?"
"I will be able to take care of my grandchildren."
"You just got on my blacklist."
"And who told you to do that?"
"You saw her, didn't you?"
"Prepare my seat at the castle for tonight."
"Where did I put it?"
"Let your people take shelter."
"Keep the wells, the grain and the wheat."
"I'll be taken out of here in a coffin."
"And what are you going to do?"
"May this house never know hunger."
"This is what we call love."
"I heard you pacing."
"Did one of those things get into her?"
"We must be able to work together on something."
"War demands a lot from each of us."
"I have eight different bosses right now."

"But that's what you did."
"This area is in the grip of a riot."
"And what's going on?"
"Have you made peace with your demons?"
"Did you see what I saw?"
"Marty, you don't think in four dimensions."
"She was always kind to me, polite."
"It was proven on the Science Channel."
"I think it's a small piano."
"No time to worry about friends."
"She brought her things back in one go."
"Who says you're legit?"
"Is that a Mustang I heard?"
"If we could hear at least one little witness?"
"And with the ideal of honest Abe."
"He was right in his statement."
"He wanted a record that we don't have."
"I was right, they'll never find him."
"What would you do, one or the other?"
"You've got your work cut out for you there."
"You know what we'll have to do to you."
"That's what you don't understand."
"I know you're doing this for me."
"I say the wind has changed."
"Who could trust such a friend?"
"I'm the one who shot you."
"No, I'm not here for that."
"This guy, what did he look like?"
"And you have always been like my fathers."
"See what else you can find."
"They are here because they want to be."
"I think something happened to him."
"Neither partner, nor neighbor, nor brother, nor friend."
"How many guns in the gym bag?"
"I'm just starting to get over it."
"Go out with her, since you love her so much."

"The second album I ever bought."

"I'll marry anyone else."
"Tell me how much we had in the trunk."
"Looks like there's a party going on."
"There is also a women's morgue."
"I'm not who you think I am."
"I have some documents for you to sign."
"I was supposed to get it in my face?"
"You called him you-know-what."
"You are no longer part of his life."
"Or do you stick to water?"
"Elizabeth, I want you to accompany this boy."
"What makes you so happy?"

"One minute in the future, to be exact."
"The sheriff is requested to bring the witness."

"That's where we met."
"Have you watched The Mickey Mouse Club lately?"
"They have to remove all the numbers from the doors."
"I'll show you what I can do."
"What happened in the woods?"
"And it's about this ball."
"They all want you to use their equipment."
"Beauty queen, committee director, devoted mother."
"I think the switch is over there."
"I must have done something right."
"Had wife, brother take her, go mountain to him."
"What are you doing in Rome?"

"You need me against Texas?"
"I have an appointment with Baroness Kessler."

"All that for this old piece of wood?"
"The way is clear, we should go."
"If you don't obey me, I'll replace you."
"Do what you want with it, live happily."
"You deserve this glorious day with the politicians."
"A hidden message in Lecter's cell."
"It's like that all over the world."
"She laid eyes on you, huh?"
"This place where my father is safe exists."
"That's how the world works."
"How do you expect me to remember that?"
"She doesn't have street instincts."
"The museum will only take us with you."
"I said 'oh yes baby', come see."
"What's up there?"
"According to you, she is in good health."
"Did you think everything would turn out like this?"
"I'm thinking about moving."
"She says the school was attacked."
"I know all the people you know."
"He spent his life in the field."
"It's going to be harder than I thought."
"All these things at the same time and more."
"I need to check something on my own."

"But the key master will be indispensable to you."
"Can you stand?"
"There is a wonderful flower in Kenya."
"That's what I wanted to talk about."
"But I'll tell you anyway."

"I need to go for a walk."
"Innocent people all end up becoming criminals."
"What brings you to us?"
"I need ID."

"When I get out of here, I'll call you."
"I'll call you if I have anything."
"No hat on real ID."
"Forrest, our lives are very different, you know."
"Try sneaking into the bridge, Dutch."
"You have to ask people, old people."
"I want you out of these cities."
"Is that why you called?"
"No need to draw me a picture."
"All that remains is to find it."
"You know, for Children's Day."
"That's where they took her."
"They just made the jump into hyperspace."
"What do you mean, you'll see her many times?"
"They didn't speak to each other after that."
"She said she didn't want anything."
"Did we get the room number?"
"They made him tell this at the table."
"Are you coming to spend the weekend with us?"
"I know what's good for him."
"Go get the paperwork from your boyfriend."
"It's good for what you have."
"I expect you to be a caring lover."
"I taught you that."
"What if we don't agree?"
"I'll send Carroll to you with a fresh horse."
"Put this in my jeep and watch them."
"You're just a luxury item."
"You've seen what I can do."
"And that's all we care about."
"They put my name in the Cup?"
"The woman was holding a baby in her arms."

"You would like this if you didn't know."
"There is a cove, we can swim."
"I love being in the courtroom."
"Come on, kids, we have to go."

"Vern, you have something in your neck."
"It is a pleasure to frequent your home."
"My father wants to force me to get married."
"He asked me to give this to you."
"But Fiona and I are married now."

"Did she show you the place?"
"I remember hearing you talk about it."
"Remember, there is little time left."
"One of our employees had an accident."
"The same can be said of you."
"It never crossed my mind."
"I hope you don't mind."
"This job pays for food and rent."
"Are you sure it's the right time?"
"It's just a bullet in the leg."
"Is that your definition of good judgment?"
"You risked everything I have."
"You think they haven't found the balance."
"Everyone who knows us will know everything."
"Don't tell me you believe it."
"It's to eat you better, my child."
"Find him before the party starts."
"I told you, I'm fine."
"There is an opening onto the street."
"No, I've never seen her before."
"A man will do what must be done."
"Do you think Yen made it?"
"And you, when did you notice the real one?"
"It was up to me to make contact."
"They say you have a boys club."
"We were supposed to go, but she left."
"The daughter of the former Tennessee Senator."
"She was here a second ago."
"I just hear the 'beep' of a beacon."
"When I'm done, let's go for the margaritas."
"You think it's for the money?"
"Everyone knows what they have to do?"
"You have something for me, I believe?"
"As well as the switch group inside?"
"My son was swallowed up by the war."
"We have to lure them to the end."
"What happened to your bag?"
"Can you at least promise me something?"

"He had said things about my wife."
"Hurry up so I can go change."
"They're not going to chase us?"
"Was this your first time at the market?"
"Barney can tell us what he thinks."
"It's so different from the outside."
"We'll give you something at the hotel."
"You have a son in the army."
"Buffy, what are you doing here?"

"I just ask you to trust me."
"He became a legend with this story."
"I saw you were out."
"She was the one who carried these monsters."
"I made coffee for my husband."
"Can you remind me what the issue is?"
"There is food and drink."

"City life doesn't suit him."
"Is this for real?"
"Throw them at me and I'll give you Doug back."
"Be careful what you say."
"No, I haven't seen anyone like that."
"Say whatever you want after the beep."
"I owe it to you."
"You're the one who turned on the television."
"There is a piano in the street."
"He speaks of a gorge, behind the mountain."
"Everything is going very well for you and Jennifer."
"I'll send someone to pick them up."
"You seem very sure of yourself."
"Well, I feel pretty good like this."
"I need to talk to someone else."
"Maybe you should face the facts."
"Do you want me to do it for you?"
"If I were God, we would all live forever."
"What happened at the party?"
"I know what I'm talking about, and you?"
"We start with a five-card game."
"We must ensure the birth of his child."
"I want to live, do more interesting things."
"I want to be that woman in your life."
"Is that why you came?"
"Between the three of us, we can find a way."
"It's true that he's standing there."
"Okay, what's going on?"
"What did it bring me?"
"Ron almost fainted at the sight of her."
"I had so much to tell him."
"You don't ask where the kids are?"
"Who, starting from nothing, makes something out of it."
"There are others waiting."
"I was thinking about the attraction of a hill."
"What's the point of all this?"
"Let the prosecution ask him clear questions."
"We saw it with our own eyes."
"What would history be without great men?"
"There are some great things in this."
"I swear I'm telling the truth."
"I offered him a position on board."
"That's why it's great."
"Who knows the secret of the copper of the bells?"
"You had to sweep the nails into the driveway."
"When did we live together?"
"I'd like to take a look at it."
"This hero job wouldn't last forever."
"And it all depends on what you want."
"Doesn't that one have the time?"
"I thought you didn't love me."
"No matter what happens, we will always be friends."
"I want to see it with my own eyes."
"Why are you the only one who understands me?"
"I think I caught something."
"I wanted to get closer to you, my darling."
"With something small, more familiar."
"The bribes, the staging."
"No, you're not there at all."
"I believe there is a God."
"But there are alternatives to fighting."
"It doesn't make it any easier."
"How do you think I found you?"
"Perhaps it would be better to prolong the therapy?"
"It's the only way to get close."
"You're the one who came to us."
"I just want you to tell the truth."
"Are you proud of what you do?"
"But at the last moment, something changed."
"You didn't know, did you?"
"This is the reason you are here."
"Who could have done such a thing?"
"What does he think he'll do with the money?"
"One by one or all at once?"
"Another farm mind game."
"They would do anything for power."
"Holly and I are having a lot of fun."
"Parents say it's worth it."
"What if you were engaged to a doctor?"

"What, what do you mean?"
"Hunter thinks he should call someone."
"I always knew you would make it."
"What exactly was the underwear in question?"
"I'll tell them you surprised me."
"It's true that I thought about it."
"If he has one, it's tiny."
"That's what the police said."
"Could we move on and start over?"
"I want us to get out of here without any injuries."
"Come, I have a word to say to you."
"Can I talk to someone else?"
"No, there is no reason."
"Please don't be embarrassed."
"We believe it's for life."
"Not everyone can do it."
"That I love myself as I am."
"This man is one of those few exceptions."
"A little rest will do me good."
"He's got it in his girl thing."
"He listens, but he understands things differently."
"I have soap and water."
"The boss sets the tone."
"I hear you know how to solve puzzles."
"Maybe you want to buy me a drink."
"You must be well regarded by the bigwigs."
"It's a kindness they do me."
"I'm glad to hear you say that."
"I'm glad to hear you say that."
"First in Hollywood, then in the East."
"I want the wheat by Friday at the latest."
"I'll pay him back next year, I promise."
"You knew very well what he was."
"I heard yesterday that you were here."
"By the way, he called early this morning."
"But if the situation gets worse, we will have to close."
"You will know how to head in the right direction."
"We'll tie you up in case of seizures."
"You left it on last night."
"Night is the best time here."
"You always did the right thing."
"I like things that are fresh and natural."
"Bulls are stronger than lions."
"I had to see if you were safe."
"I have never seen such a spectacle."
"Think about what I said, Clarice."
"Would I have encouraged you to see her otherwise?"
"You need a password to read them."
"Where is the coach I knew?"
"Maybe she's always been like this."
"Do what you can for my daughter."
"It's as if time stands still."
"They did what they thought was right."
"It was the policeman who got me."
"Santa Rosa police officers will be there."
"Do you think it's the same there?"
"What do you offer me?"
"It was like I didn't exist."
"I think this is our little girl."
"But generally, everything was going well."
"All my hair comes together and rests."
"I suggested that he dress differently."
"You are no longer able to work."
"Would I be here if I had taken it?"
"The world is what you make of it."
"Listen to what I have to say to you."
"Cook yourself whatever there is."
"Oh, yeah, but it's so far away."
"Were you wearing glasses all this time?"
"What do we do now?"
"They use it to lower the rating."
"How did you know I'm here?"
"Your ex's kid, your stepson."
"Because I know he's there."
"And this number that comes up all the time?"
"You can do that, can't you?"
"He seems like a good guy."
"You don't know what happened."
"What do you want to tell him?"
"Want to get paid for something else, Dan?"
"Is that you I was talking to?"
"I thought you should know."
"Two is all you'll get."
"What are you doing in Philadelphia?"
"You know them and you don't like them."
"You are able to inspect it yourself."
"She was just doing her job, that's all."
"He disappeared around a street corner."
"You didn't have a dad either?"
"I think I know what to do."
"There's only one for you."
"But I like what I heard."
"All is well, gentlemen, they are with me."
"Yes, someone told him about you."
"That's what the doctor said."
"I'll be there in an hour or two."
"It's been with you since that day."
"I asked them."
"Chief, what does that mean?"
"I hope for your sake that this is true."
"There is everything you are looking for."
"But what is she doing there?"
"We think we can use it to our advantage."
"How can you be so sure of yourself?"
"What an honor that you thought of me."
"I like him, he makes me laugh."
"I will have the last word on the story."
"And we will have another honeymoon."
"Is he going to stay with us?"
"But you have to come with me to the station."
"This time, we'll follow my method."
"I came all the way to Iraq for you."
"Maybe they're not girls."
"You're not planning on doing that, I hope."
"Ask your questions before we get there."
"This is the guy I saw."
"Could I have some more coffee?"
"Looks like they came here too."
"I apologize for keeping you waiting."
"Your identity papers, please."
"Go outside, both of you, forward march."
"Who allowed you to order a pizza?"
"In case something happens to me."
"He can do whatever he wants."
"But you will have a bigger challenge ahead."
"You need to keep your mind occupied."
"A place where he feels safe?"
"It is said to be an old city."
"What happened to Angela?"
"Is that all you saw?"
"He never came home."
"Mrs. Sloan over there is our social worker."
"If you want it, it's yours."
"Did you see what I did?"
"That's good, what you did."
"I can't talk to my wife?"
"This is what makes a relationship last."
"You should give him what he wants."
"My father calls me on another line."
"But I have a favor to ask of you."
"Your work is so interesting, personal and unique."
"Neither a car nor a job."
"It's for the good of the family."
"This place is buried deep under a mountain."
"It turns out I have a solution."
"Dad, what happened?"
"He might be a really cool pharmacist."
"I must be irresistible, calm, confident."
"What's going on with your father?"
"A town built around the railway."
"Have I ever threatened you?"
"This is the true nature of the Universe."
"The only love of my life was gone."
"I took over my father's practice."
"I won't promise anything, but I'll look."
"The Company agrees to take you back."
"There are blankets in the closet."
"I have several phone calls to make."
"Coming from twelve different paths in life."
"He must have had a late model rifle."
"In every new city, always the same white people."
"Power over the mind of man."
"And how do you plan to achieve this?"
"What did you want to say about Ashley?"
"Ice cream or Mel Gibson's butt?"
"You better make it work."
"The lab is analyzing it."
"I would like a good slice of this cake."
"He looks completely normal."
"It took me six hours to make them."
"Although he has an apartment in the city."
"Want to say hello to your little world?"
"Of course, but I'm talking about the diamond."
"It's just what I needed."
"This man must be silenced."
"Yes, I see her, she's right in front."
"Do what you need to do to cover yourself."
"I finally managed to have an orgasm."
"And I saw him at mine."
"It's delicious with Charlotte's honey."
"Yes, but Lorraine wants to go with you."
"Is this Chinese, what I'm saying?"
"Yes, it looks like it to me."
"How many times have I told you?"
"It's something we can talk about."
"Except Elizabeth, who is, in fact, a woman."
"She's thinner than on TV."
"Do you think there is a connection?"
"Do you think there is a connection?"
"And he has nice hair, that counts."
"Everyone has the right to live."
"I know you know where they are."
"What we're looking for is in this closet."
"Have you asked an older student?"
"You know what I love about you?"
"Are there any feds on the case?"
"So take a look at this."
"But it looks like they're all here."
"Take my phone and go through the switchboard."
"She had nothing to do with it."
"I need a glass of wine."
"I want it more than anything in the world."
"You don't go near Tao anymore, understand?"
"And I had more company."
"You are meant for each other."
"Doctors say he can't control himself."
"I told him to go home."
"We need you to come with us."
"I'll get you a cup of tea."
"Not about this case, but about yourself."
"Something is happening at the bank."
"A juice and coffee bar."
"Maybe we can talk about it tomorrow morning?"
"I think it's in the air."
"I think it's in the air."
"But with the intention of bringing it back to you."
"Thank you for putting me on the flag."
"There will be a door open when you exit."
"I accept your bet and I follow you."
"He filled up on alcohol, exploded."
"You weren't 'forced' to do it, were you?"
"I believe you knew my wife, Tessa."
"Is it on automatic refueling and in sequence?"
"I've never seen one so calm."
"I'm not quite sure yet."
"They'll probably wonder where I am."
"The Air Force has spotted you."
"Trust him, he's our new master."
"God knows we need him."
"What don't you believe?"
"What does this word taste like to you, Clarice?"
"They will one day sit at these desks."
"If Melanie says so, you have to believe her."
"Is it only on the bat?"
"I want my son to speak several languages."
"The following did not happen."
"I'm taking care of it."
"Some say he went too far."
"Wait, what's going on?"
"We are in rhythm, elements of a movement."

"Would you like me to take the controls, Captain?"
"Men like to talk when they are happy."
"There is justice in this country."
"I would like you to do me a favor."
"Can I trust you?"
"I'll give you a ton of money."
"You will find answers to your questions very soon."
"I'm talking about what makes us the same."
"Sorry to have dragged you into all this."

"I have been at this bank for seven years."
"Maybe I should go back to Naomi."
"It's your turn to speak, Clarice."
"You only have half a card."
"That's all we know."
"Sundays when I went to work with Dad."
"I need someone to listen to me."
"I told you, I don't know."
"So what am I doing here?"
"Sorry, I mistook you for someone else."
"You're lucky to be whole."
"That's what I like best about her."
"I think you should talk to the colonel."
"I thought you had a boyfriend."
"I thought you would never come back."
"You have to let me handle this."
"My father never got over it."
"I think it worked out pretty well."
"I know because I have to."
"Are you really tough?"
"We must be careful with this man."
"I want them on the nose of the ship."
"I know she uses another name."
"How did you do that?"
"This is the beginning of a new era."
"You mean he understood us?"
"You have to have something to talk about property."
"I'll give you some privacy."
"She said she found me attractive?"
"You heard, do what I say."
"How much did you earn for your last film?"
"Maybe he wants to be spotted."
"Did she hope for it or did you promise her?"
"The toilets are at the end of the corridor."
"There are other means of persuasion."
"I came to Naples to buy two horses."
"Everything we have is here, man."
"Maybe this is it, you know?"
"You should never have come to Africa."
"What's next?"
"I see what you're trying to do."
"She knows exactly what she's doing."
"You are all that matters to me."
"Lana's dad gave this to us."
"What did you give him?"

"What's in the suitcase?"
"And then he says, 'Give me a good high five.'"
"I bet you didn't call her."
"May I ask what this is about?"
"She didn't know you were a girl."
"I think there's a Sally."
"And I've done it all my life."
"How long has it been since you last saw each other?"
"The spirit of Troy is in this sword."
"Where did he take her?"
"I need to go back and fix things."
"Do you know who you remind me of?"
"I hope you will be comfortable."
"Did you have them on you from the beginning?"
"And I never want to see you again."
"Son of refugees, where are you going like this?"
"You will tell me which files you want to see."

"No, I don't want to go back to Sydney."
"No one agreed with my idea."
"You are addressing a future municipal councilor."
"Swore it would be a night of love."
"After what you did for me?"
"Make some noise before opening the door."
"Unless you have other plans."
"Do you miss spending time together?"
"Yes, I did it."
"It's nice there, do you like it?"
"Who saw what happened?"
"There is more to life."

"Because we're going to need flour."
"It will be sold in bags on the beach."
"But different boys are interesting for different reasons."
"Is that what you said to yourself?"
"Remember, we were supposed to call Vargas and Reyes."
"How did it go last night?"
"So, that's what I did."
"Always with his hat, ready for battle."
"This woman kicked us out."
"It might prove what he said."
"Are you sure your dog will win?"
"May I ask you a few questions, Colonel?"
"I don't remember the tune anymore."
"He wants to know what you think."
"You didn't tell them anything about me?"
"It's a beautiful Friday morning in Portland."
"And what time do you think it is?"
"And there's me and my friends."
"That's the last thing I want."
"What do you think about it?"
"That's the name of Jeff's journal."
"See if you can get anything out of it."
"Is she proud of me?"
"They put bars on his windows."
"In a motel, on the old highway."
"Usually a book or newspaper article."

"I have to know, it's essential."
"What did I ask you?"
"Each of these guys served their country."
"You have a bone sticking out of your arm."
"What do you know about that?"
"But it's the middle of the night."
"I want her to go to college."
"They need a helping hand."
"Do we want this to happen?"
"Think of the riches we will share."
"Don't ask your aunt these questions."
"I want you to put an end to this."
"Here is one of his tricks."
"The further we are, the more we love each other."
"Have there been similar dreams?"
"My instinct tells me it's him."
"You say 'enough', what do you mean by that?"
"Have strangers entrusted you with packages?"
"If that's what you want to believe."
"Sex and the Orient go together."
"What happened there?"
"You are interesting for a very specific reason."
"I put it there."
"I must cost less than a shrink."
"See if the wind is blowing from the east?"
"I never trusted her."
"Then place it in the center of the press."
"It's better than a bag of bones."
"It's much more than that, my friend."
"It's going to sell like hotcakes."
"It's my right as a man."
"I had a few drinks, that's all."
"What's happening to your voice?"

"It will take me a month to rebuild it."
"This is the path I must follow."
"The specialist will bring something to the world."
"Tell him we're in the middle of a game."
"What's worth it?"
"But I want you to stay with me."
"Only three guys used it this morning."
"He thinks you're his real mom."
"What do you expect from us?"
"I am not just another broker."
"What is this supposed to prove?"
"They kicked him out of the protection program."
"For yelling at you earlier."
"What's the point of trying to make yourself understood?"
"She does what she has to do."
"I will come back and make my request properly."
"I have a little something for you."
"So we are all men of our word."
"You are the daughter of the old chief."
"To what do we owe the honor of your visit?"
"Next time, will you plug the detector into it?"
"I want someone to explain this phone to me."
"I had to see it with my own eyes."
"Something happened between us."
"I wish you all the happiness in the world."
"No, we're not doing anything special, we're eating."

"But we still went far."
"Send Ross's profile to the front page."
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
"I wanted to thank you for the other day."
"Go to the bar and turn left."
"Honey, can I ask you a personal question?"
"He says you're a good boy."
"She left two hours ago."
"I've done it a million times."
"One of them was in the room."
"Sorry to ruin your Saturday."
"He's a year older than you."
"You can go talk to him if you want."
"Call me if you want to go shopping."
"Did you like the hand cream?"
"I don't need you to watch over me."
"You're just as much of a soul reader, Edward."
"I told you I was fine."
"What do you want to do then?"
"It's a kind of salvation for you."
"You are somewhat familiar with the crew."
"Please, you must believe me."
"Don't you want to know what it is?"
"The grave and the date are still there."
"They knew where to find us and who to find."
"I have a good reason to get up."
"Warriors, prepare for the disc battle."

"I hope everything went well."
"There's enough gold as it is."
"I hope things will be better there."

"At least, that's what they say."
"Show me what you can do."

"What did your mother say?"
"Thank you, Commodore, for helping us leave."
"Are you proud of doing your job well?"
"Take your dragons and mercenaries and go."
"My father got reports from the station."
"How many people were on board?"
"You think we need another one."
"Wait, I have something to tell you."
"There were several shots fired."
"He wanted to write something, it seems."
"This is the little machine that started it all."
"What if the last letter came from an imitator?"
"But where did he write it from?"
"Do you remember my little brother, Roberto?"
"What are you doing around here?"
"What did he force you to do?"
"What else would I do?"
"Unless they don't know."
"I thought it was mushrooms."
"Do you blame your father for your fate?"
"It would be nice to see this city grow."
"I will do everything to live up to it."
"I am very happy and healthy."
"Was it Ben Gardner who took it?"
"Free to do what I wanted with it."
"Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?"
"They'll be there for at least two hours."
"I sowed the grass on his golf course."
"That's all I have now."
"I want to talk to my girlfriend in private."
"No, it's not good at all."
"I'm fast and I love stone."
"But what do you know about it?"
"Would you listen to your history lesson?"
"I like to know who I'm dealing with."
"Are you the type to follow advice?"
"You speak as if I were a professional."
"You don't need me here?"
"Is there anything else?"
"I'll only be a moment."
"Are the boys still making fun of his camera?"

"There are programs everywhere now."
"I'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself."
"He will be a new man when he returns."
"Yes, it was also called 'irresistible impulse'."
"The money we give him is precious."
"I wonder if he lives around here?"
"This is my grandmother's house."
"What did you buy me?"
"And of his own free will, I mean."
"You and I will open the door."
"Psychological support can be very effective."
"So it should have had a white image."
"That's when I saw everything."
"My father always came here after work."
"Do you know how romantic that is?"
"Please don't say that."
"Go see if there are any survivors."
"I have just been made a Knight in Portugal."
"Did you bring him here?"
"One last question about my son."
"Are you sure about what you're saying?"
"Can't we have a good laugh?"
"Like making love for the first time."
"I'm not proud, it's true."
"This is what we are trying to find out."
"When would I find the time to do it?"
"I remember the day we met."
"No, you did the right thing."
"The last one in bed is a hairy toad."
"Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?"
"To the place where I left you."
"You loved their second one, Des Filles très tendance."
"Kid, it's great to see you throwing."
"I want to go there after college."
"I'll have this painting in a few days, I promise."
"As long as everyone knows it."
"What are they doing?"
"And what do I look like?"
"What does he want to do with it?"
"I need a nice hot bath."
"In the morning it starts and everything is fine."
"He neutralized two of my men again."
"Looks like they still have work to do."
"Look, let's keep this to ourselves for now."
"You know very well what I want."
"So what am I doing here?"
"I'll show you the rest of the house."
"I've never had a boyfriend."
"What you say will be held against you."
"It makes me want to push one."
"This is what I wanted to show you."
"I'll send you some money."
"What should I tell you?"
"That's all you have left."
"There are plenty of cops there."
"It's just down the street."
"Do I really have a choice?"
"It was time to move on."
"And what does it bring me?"
"The best is probably L. T. Quinn."
"Oh, there's something else."
"What did he tell you?"
"There will be a report this afternoon."
"Do you want me to take care of him?"
"You always loved my mood swings."
"She wants to give you her wedding dress."
"I've told you twice already."
"It's up to me to take care of it."
"Don't you have a job to do?"
"What's in the other?"
"What did he ask you?"
"He must have a heart like a ham."
"And I know what we saw."
"We're going to have to use the 'international language'."
"An agent in every room of the hospital."
"She was there when it happened."
"And I'm very grateful to you, Abe."
"I think I'll stay a while."
"Were you sent to a psychiatrist?"
"Fortunately, no one is currently capable of this."
"The more I work, the luckier we get."
"You think I don't know that?"
"No, I'll take care of it myself."
"I hoped you would remember her."
"I have a guy who does portraits."
"It was a good place to live for a while."
"No, don't do that. I'm sorry."
"People in a cabin, always the same."
"I feel more confident now."
"I think Tessa was right then, Tim."
"And I promise you something in return."
"You know, one day we'll be like him."
"What do you want for that?"
"Deep tear in the right arm, with arterial hemorrhage."
"We were playing billiards, that's true."
"Do you want to go for a drink?"
"Don't cut until I say 'Cut'."
"Helen, bring some cotton and alcohol."
"I believe this artist will become famous."
"No, if you don't want to come."
"She thought you'd still be at camp."
"Who do you think changed the route?"
"I think I just did it."
"Yoko told us."
"You must do what I tell you."
"They will do the shopping, I will cook."
"As if that's all I had to do."
"What happened in Maine?"
"Act like nothing happened."
"Julian thinks I have real potential."
"The store was there to get your attention."
"I did everything I could."
"Do you want me to come to you?"
"What am I paying you for if not this?"
"I only need to hear them once."
"To be honest, the council likes this decision."
"I fought in the war, in the trenches."
"No, and I'm not going to."
"Come fill your glasses and sing with me."
"Would I have done all this to give up now?"
"It's good that you could come."
"It serves as dinner and breakfast."
"Whose tea is it?"
"What you think, the mouth says."
"Does the heartbreaker have what he needs?"
"I enjoyed making love with you."
"That makes you a big shot over there."
"It was 'The Old Boy from Greer County'."
"How did it go with your mother?"
"The hotel entrance has been cleared."
"Should I turn around and close my eyes?"
"Your mother and I are proud of you."
"Shall I tell you what I did?"
"What, you can't tell me?"
"But we're talking about someone else."
"We have to get there before the Russians."
"Please don't apologize."
"Do you know South Sudan, Mr. Black?"
"I am a donkey, I was born outside."
"If you can be there in five minutes."
"But you still believe in our mission?"
"The following year, I was born."
"If you want something, just tell me."
"You must understand why I betrayed you."
"You know what's going to happen."
"That's why I came to see you."
"We know very well why they did it."
"It's nice to have you join us."
"You think I won't do it?"
"If he's there, we'll send you there."
"I could sell them at the store, you know?"
"No, that doesn't mean anything to me at all."
"I wonder how she's doing."
"I think I'll have a drink."
"I've heard about you a lot, Nora."
"This beyond from which we do not return."
"And of course, there will be sports."
"But here, my life does not belong to me."
"I thought you didn't like me."
"I much prefer you the way you are."
"They do what they have to do."
"The cops are everywhere because of you."
"In the very beginning, there were men."
"I hope this is good news."
"I didn't call you about that."
"Registration card and license, please."
"What produces this luminous effect?"
"A man with a dream, on the rise."
"Don't play games with me."
"You never know who's next."
"This Law Commission must see it that way."
"I fought for you to play."
"What will I have to do?"
"I want to know what you think about it."
"Or was it real?"
"I read your articles on the Caïd."
"And you're completely obsessed with a treasure."
"The one everyone looks at first."
"Search his column while you're at it."
"You already know what happened to me."
"So what did you do to get there?"
"Your file is clean and you are talented."
"I am comfortable with my sexuality."
"It's perfect for self-defense, all that."
"Lunch will be served for the guards."
"I know we've had our disagreements."
"Let's go have a drink now, in the cafeteria."
"You say yes to everything that happens."
"The time for your last wishes has come."
"And then, what does it change?"
"Master Turner is free to go ashore."
"I have some papers for you to sign."
"There's something new, are you ready?"
"We're back where we started."
"He will hear the passage over the dam."
"No, you gave him something much more important."
"Is it time for the shrink or what?"
"I can restore your status in Wheeler."
"That's it, all the men are gathered."
"She will, Commander, if necessary."
"Yes, that's exactly what I would think."
"He sometimes has a small retinue with him."
"It's prom night."
"She was the one who came to see me."
"You and I, now we will continue together."
"That's how we like it."
"Agent Starling is a deep pigeon."
"Your attention please, priority operation."
"There are things you need to know."
"I have something you should see."
"It's so wonderful to be able to do this."
"How did I not see it before?"
"I think about this bike every day."
"When are we making the strawberry cake?"
"What do you have on your feet?"
"Can I borrow some money from you?"
"Please call me back when you can."
"I hope we see you again very soon."
"We did what we had to do."
"One butt here and the other butt blows."
"I made a promise to your father."
"Exit by opening the door from the outside."
"How did you live all that time?"
"Did you listen to what I said?"
"You are the one who needs us."
"You have the honor of being his crew."
"I said I agreed."
"She never had to do it."
"Can I trust you, yes or no?"
"I have to tell you the truth."
"Let me dot the i's and cross the t's."
"I sent it to you."
"It's not just guns."
"I think he went that way."
"I thought of you the whole time."
"He asked me to give it to you."
"How do you know what I said?"
"She will show her repentance to the whole city."
"I thought she was a girlfriend."
"That's what people think of me."
"No, that's the wholesale price."
"The perpetrators of the coup are in the bank."
"I wanted to participate in saving the kingdom."
"Is that all you can say?"
"Did you put that there?"
"I know where you boarded."
"For work, but he invited you."
"People keep headlines in their heads."
"He is humanity's last hope."
"Player number two enters the game."
"What if tomorrow the war could end?"
"The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away."
"Don't you think Mom is being unfair?"
"They slept together after three times."
"Would you like to wait until I'm safely inside?"
"I went back to bury my wife."
"No one knows what happened to him."
"That's the name I give it."
"Everything is going well for you and Jennifer."
"You seem to be doing well."
"I need you at home."
"Where can I find one like this?"
"The man in the back is the boss."
"I have to finish what she started."
"I asked you the question first."
"Some are glad that Mr. Gandhi is imprisoned."
"Have you ever thought about helping the family?"
"So, it's the big game, it seems?"
"I'm going to go on the boat with Sugar."
"Can you play music with this?"
"There is something else here."
"I know he wants me there."
"I was passing by and saw a light."
"It takes two to tango."
"It is an honor to meet you, sir."
"I just needed to see something."
"You said you had something to show me."
"How do you keep them like that?"
"I think I should call the police."
"If you were smart, you would love it too."
"When should I present myself to the Executive Council?"
"How long have you known about this?"
"You were never in the background."
"That's cool, it's my dad's."
"I know what will make you feel good."
"Justice must be the same for all."
"It will be the greatest war ever fought."
"It is a simple reflection of my admiration."
"I thought he was going to faint."
"Call the mayor and give him the information."
"Like we did with the Cylons."
"You might become a real writer one day."
"Maybe he likes climbing trees."
"I helped him load his car."
"You'd better call a good lawyer."
"Have you ever been mistaken for a man?"
"Until you're upright."
"Because I don't have time."
"You see, Mercer, every man has a price."
"Do you see what I just did?"
"It was on his desk at closing time."
"When did you change your mind last night?"
"What will they say up there?"
"I think I've already found it."
"She was there a moment ago."
"At least I had your mother."
"I swear I saw him move."
"I've already had that from Stuart."
"This is just what we need."
"I just need to see something."
"There is a man in my room."
"What can she possibly be doing?"
"I always loved watching them from behind."
"You haven't changed either."
"She just finished a decorating course."
"How do I know you?"
"It's for his son's teacher."
"And the centuries of wisdom they contain."
"No, I think I'll allow the question."
"I need to rest a little."
"What would the boss say about this headline?"
"Tristan, make sure the coast is clear."
"You know, I think you're right."
"By the way, what time is it where you are?"
"I could say the same thing for you."
"Is he on the radar of the Public Treasury?"
"If you would please come this way, doctor."
"That's what makes life interesting."
"We saw what was there."
"I know this is a big decision."
"There are always beautiful women here."
"If you want to pay the price, you can."
"Age is just a number, baby."
"I hope to hear them sing this one day."
"Find something we can use."
"I told you he was telling the truth."
"Whatever comes to mind."
"There is something in his mouth."
"This is the world you know."
"What's in this glass?"
"Teddy and Vern, look to the left of the tracks."
"There is a tomb under the church."
"I want to put you at ease."
"That's how I understand it."
"I put something in yours."
"You knew him much better than I did."
"You know the sacrifices I made."
"How could you not tell me anything?"
"On top of a building on the river."
"He's donating his liver to us, madam."
"He thinks I'm on his side."
"There is probably a backup system."
"It's better than home, huh?"
"Can you see who it is, honey?"
"But you have something on your mind."
"He was the one who studied."
"It seems like everyone has left."
"Can I take a look at it?"
"I just stopped by to say goodbye to Tess."
"I don't know him, but he's doing well."
"I told you not to answer."
"What is there to see, Commander?"
"My son wants to give you one last chance."
"All this work, and you don't eat anything?"
"What are you going to do on Saturday?"
"What's it like working for your father?"
"How did your visit with Gordon go?"
"This is a photo sold with the frame."
"You made me a happy man."
"And every night, we read a book."
"Do you have instincts for these things?"
"You're as safe as in a car."
"Let them give you what they have."
"I can give you the rest later."
"What does that make us?"
"Who else do you want it to be?"
"HQ, send target info."
"Would it be easier for you in the dark?"
"I realized you were an enigma."
"The picture is as good as in the cinema."
"Here, across the street."
"This is the plan of your God."
"Say what you have to say to me."
"I was told you were sick."
"You are in the service of order, Clarice."
"They've been asking for a plane for hours."
"I saw her hanging around the neighborhood."
"I was entrusted with the entire file."
"But I didn't expect that."
"That's how I respect myself."
"Is that what you call it?"
"It even surprised Old Moses at first."
"I always choose a cartoon character."
"You're kidding yourself."
"You only answer to the name Christie."
"I never said goodbye to him."
"Edward, would you like some butter with your bread?"
"Don't you always leave someone telling the story?"
"And you, how long do you plan to survive?"
"In this case, they are everywhere."
"At first, it was curiosity."
"If you want a room, it's full."
"Maybe we weren't grateful enough."
"They make you what they want."
"I will sign when they are safe."
"She's a very pretty woman, your wife."
"Did you know Lecter before you were his patient?"
"It was a good plan so far."
"Nick and I want to go to bed."
"Since when have you stopped looking for work?"
"I want you to feel at home."
"We had faith in the same goal."
"Let's see what you've got."
"I'll give you the Knicks and fuck you."
"You will pay for a good education for your child."
"There is a force field behind it."
"Can I talk to you about that for a moment?"
"My name is fine like that, isn't it?"
"Who isn't in this profession?"
"It's no secret to me."
"I'm the one who made you win."
"That's where they met."
"Let me take a look at it."
"How do we manage the entrances and exits?"
"I'm the man of the house."
"Machines control North San Francisco."
"Lily, what are you doing here?"
"It was so true, like reality."
"It's just you and me, buddy."
"We started this together, you and me."
"Ah, so the Baron is your main character?"
"What if we went to the reception together?"
"How did it go at the hospital?"
"Give the kid a bottle, he's hungry."
"But you were a hero during the war."
"The Russians, on the other side of the river."
"I saw you in court one day."
"I let her hear what she wants."
"Guess what I did last night."
"What does she have to do with it?"
"That's what you like about me."
"I decided to enjoy life."
"I guess Taylor tells him what to do."
"She must be about your age."
"He buys coke and leaves."
"What do I say to others?"
"She will be richer and more powerful than ever."
"He took a full case of whiskey with him."
"There's a price on my head."
"I tell them they have the license."
"Do you know who this is?"
"I see you're having a good life."
"I was also able to go to university."

"I'll tell you what we were doing."
"Make it sooner."
"He is Muslim, and we get along well."

"Is that why you're helping me?"
"How come you're here?"
"A little late to change careers, Tim."
"I have pink and white ones."
"Mother sends me to see what's going on."
"All this to ask me about a treasure?"
"So what did you say?"
"I was gentle, that's my job."
"So what happened?"
"What did I gain from it?"
"That he knows this island better than I do?"
"There are some for whom it is important."
"Need a stable or a room?"
"How would I know if you can defend me?"
"No, it's not your heart, okay."
"I told you to stay there."
"What if I only have girls?"

"But you, Adrian, you're just a man."
"We think he's brilliant and he's a nerd."
"You look more and more like your father."
"Let me know if you need anything."
"You have the right to speak to a lawyer."
"On my father's grave, Spider-Man will pay."
"This is where we're going to have a conversation."
"You can hang up, try to have a normal life."
"That's a kindness my husband could say."
"Come with me if you value your life."
"No, I discovered this at the same time as you."
"My mother's boyfriend came over last night."
"On the left after the door, one cross per person."
"Because I have an interpreter at hand."
"I've never seen one that big."
"Not if we travel in God's channel."
"Maybe tomorrow I'll come to the villa."
"For me, it's like yesterday."
"You played well, that's what matters."
"I told you, I can't."
"It's within everyone's reach."
"We hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again soon."
"You can do it, so you can raise your kid."
"Good work Colonel, the country is proud of you."
"You're going to tell me who set this up."
"My God, what's going on?"
"They had the child and then got married."
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"You don't have parents to take him in."
"Please excuse us, we have to speak privately."
"What can we do for you?"
"Not as long as I have a say."
"Tony there are civilians in the room."
"I knew I would get it sooner or later."
"I come to the subject of one of them."
"Suddenly, no one knows what to say."
"Everyone will know what you did."
"We'll see if this code is worth the price."
"That's all I can afford."
"There is someone who wants to see you."
"No, it has nothing to do with that."
"Do you think the world is coming to an end?"
"You know very well how I feel about you."
"That's why he did it."
"What else are you hiding from me?"
"What else are you hiding from me?"
"I told them you love them just as much."
"I've never been so proud of you."
"What's so special about it?"
"She and her friends were going bar hopping."
"Tell him he needs to be trained."
"Now we have the power to finish the job."
"Where she was last seen."
"What are you doing in my room?"
"How could you not tell me?"
"What are you doing up so early?"
"Show me what you've got."
"I thought we were done with this."
"I think they want us to follow them."
"That's when I discovered the truth."
"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
"All of Archie's systems are upgraded."
"Yes, but with you it counts for four years."
"That's why I called you."
"What's down there?"
"My brother didn't know anything about dragons."
"Does this mean anything to you?"
"Does this mean anything to you?"
"That's what I was told."
"You have no orders to give me."
"You don't give me orders."
"If you have something to say, go ahead."
"If you need anything."
"This is the beginning of something wonderful."
"You have to tell him."
"Do you know how short life is?"
"Is there anyone here?"
"It was Diane who slept here, not Katie."
"I've never eaten anything so good."
"Something we took from the workshop."
"Is this how it's going to happen?"
"There is something I don't understand."
"I had breakfast with my mother."
"I have only one word to say to you."
"Except that's not what I wanted."
"Please don't go away."
"It would be a form of time travel."
"There was me, Nicky, and a young guy, Carson."
"This might be what you need."
"I do what I want when I want."
"He's my stepfather, I'm sure of it."
"Do you remember what happened?"
"What do you do with your days?"
"You've spent your life hiding in the shadows."
"That has always been the difference between us."
"I have something in store for him that he will like."
"What do you think they are doing right now?"
"Only one other person knows what I do."
"I have never known a more responsible man."
"Apparently it was a gift from his boss."
"They will have to accept your takeover of the system."
"I'll find you one, ten if you want."
"But what did they do to you?"
"I'll tell you what you're going to do."
"I'll tell him to call you back after his meeting."
"There is also a gift from Miss Yu."
"Call me as soon as you get this message."
"What do you want to do?"
"Like any good story, this one is about a girl."
"This is the guy I told you about."
"Do you know what the Dwarf says to that?"
"I need you to do this for me."
"Did she say anything to you?"
"Is there anyone else here?"
"What time did your mother do this to you?"
"He's bursting into tears."
"And that's exactly what I did."
"Colonel, the world needs to see this as soon as possible."
"What's wrong with you?"
"What's on your face?"
"There's a storm in the air."
"Is that why you wanted to see me?"
"As soon as we locate him, send a team."
"A college friend, Wally Weaver, introduced us."
"We see what they have inside them coming."
"I was free and I wanted to hear your voice."
"What have we done for you?"
"What do you want to do with this?"
"That's the least we can say."
"I'll know what it is one day."
"You didn't come to apologize to me?"
"I don't think we have a choice."
"Can I ask you something?"
"I'm across the street."
"At least I'm not hiding behind a mask anymore."
"Someone left their keys in their car?"
"Your support and enthusiasm made this triumph possible."
"Everything you tell me will stay between us."
"It's your choice if you come with me."
"And I have every intention of having it."
"He'll be here any minute."
"What did Graham Greene want to communicate in this passage?"
"Am I present in your memories?"
"We'll talk about Afghanistan, keep a cool head."
"You know what happens, you've been there."
"Nor because we need your talents."
"I hope the other Guardians can understand that."
"You just don't know it yet."
"On behalf of the staff, we would like to offer you this."
"I'll do your shopping for you, in your car."
"You still have a lot of jokes like that."
"What does that mean exactly?"
"Let's see if you have something behind your ear."
"Is that what they say about me now?"
"You didn't expect that, did you?"
"You only have this word in your mouth."
"It's the best day of your life."
"I'm proud to join the group, Mildred."
"That's where we came in."
"All I had to do was pull the rope."
"Transmit your entry code into the protective field."
"What you need to know, you know."
"You don't know what that means?"
"She's the one who needs to be told."
"Has a Jew no eyes?"
"It took him an hour to come to."
"It's now, at the end, that you understand."
"Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
"Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on."
"It takes a lot of paperwork to revive you."
"It is an honor to finally meet you, Your Majesty."
"What in heaven's name is going on?"
"Are you sure this was a good idea?"
"Tell me what you want me to do."
"In the evening, they came to show me the photos."
"I did it because I love you."
"Did you understand what I told you?"
"What's in his throat?"
"He does what he thinks is best."
"That's what I tried to do."
"We had it and we let it go."
"May they benefit you better than previous masters."
"You are there with your family and friends."
"Do you believe Hal's emotions are sincere?"
"Make them wear only what modesty dictates."
"At first, I wanted to know how it started."
"My wife is with a friend in L.A."
"Look what they did to my hand."
"It was a pleasure doing business with you."
"No, it's not what you think."
"She told Nadine about her first communion."
"Tell my daughters I'll be fine."
"I'll get back to you as soon as I know more."
"Mr. Jameson told me to give this to you."
"And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
"What is this thing called love?"
"As a token of my goodwill, here is a present."
"You have a power I will never have."
"I just didn't expect it."
"I'm sick of you talking behind my back."
"What do you say to that, huh?"
"Would you trust me after what happened?"
"It is at the bottom of a very large lake."
"And you never made the first move."
"Will we be the heroes of songs or stories?"
"So I can afford to make promises."
"Thank you, God bless Iron Man and America."
"Do you think there are others?"
"An excerpt from Ludwig van der Welt's sublime Ninth."
"You have nothing else to tell me?"
"Do you remember what you told me?"
"Do you remember what you told me?"
"And you, what did you do there?"
"So what are you still doing here?"
"I'll be outside if you need me."
"I still have work here, I'll be home late."
"What are you doing in my bed?"
"Believe in me as I believed in you."
"What would you do in my place?"
"I shot him there with two bullets."
"Is this real or just my imagination?"
"This is the only favor I ask of you."
"That's why I wanted to see you."
"You could add fuel to increase speed."
"They heard about this before we left."
"It's best to take it slow with some women."
"What's for dinner?"
"Would you mind telling me what's going on?"
"I know what happened last night."
"Is he coming, or is he another rabbit?"
"It's time to pull together."
"The time has come to draw the sword together."
"I took the rope and tied the knot."
"I said he wasn't there."
"You have to ask him."
"I told him what he wanted to hear."
"That's very kind, but it wasn't necessary."
"They held a council in the courthouse."
"She told me not to do it."
"What is it, my love?"
"I have everything I ever wanted."
"What your father did was very brave."
"Does she know what happened to your hand?"
"I don't think it was an accident."
"There might be something in there."
"You don't look so good either."
"Did something happen?"
"There's What-Is-Her-Name with her."
"She must have been hiding around here for a while."
"I thought I could train him as well as Yoda."
"My friends, who will walk on water with me?"
"And that he is here as a spy."
"Yes, but I need a quiet place."
"Everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine."
"Please proceed to the nearest exit."
"I told you it wouldn't work."
"New wallpaper for the bathroom?"
"Did you receive the money I sent?"
"Take off your jacket and turn east."
"It sounds like the famous final word."
"I have the police on my tail myself."
"You never have time for me anymore."
"It was a year before I met you."
"You know what the teammate tells you."
"Do you know what I did this morning?"
"Your head is bigger than your casino."
"You think I didn't see you?"
"No, actually I went to see a movie."
"You love this bird, don't you?"
"What the hell happened to you?"
"You must wish to continue your search for young Skywalker."
"It's like it never happened."
"So I hold the door, I hold the TV."
"What do you want to do later?"
"I remember it like it was yesterday."
"What are you doing here so late?"
"How long does it take to clean the room and clear it out?"
"And that all this is just a dream."
"I hope you won't mind."
"In fact, we are currently at the experimental stage."
"I don't know what happened."
"Please do as I say."
"If you don't want to talk to me, that's fine."
"You think that's what I want?"
"I've never seen it from that angle."
"She often washes your head with it, they say."
"I have to sort this guy out."
"Sounds like a good idea to me."
"I wonder if this is a good idea."
"He took a bullet to the head."
"A Jedi's power comes from the Force."
"Please don't interfere."
"And the eye in the sky is watching over us all."
"I live across the street."
"That's why you're beautiful."
"I was going to dive in to find the ones I wanted."
"I think I know what it is."
"To give you what you've always wanted."
"I didn't say you were."
"Why do we have a professional team in Nashville?"
"One look from her and the city collapses."
"When you have to go, you have to go."
"I wanted you to think I was smart."
"What exactly happened?"
"You have a nice home here, loving parents."
"Do I keep my promises, or do I not?"
"Do you really think this is a good idea?"
"We have whatever you want."
"That's what scares me the most."
"I didn't say it was."
"He bought me this bag abroad."
"I heard you were on board."
"Do you know that I have often thought of you?"
"And what is there to send you back?"
"You have to have a little fun in life."
"Eventually, I found myself back where I started."
"You think I don't know?"
"Don't you see what we've become, Tony?"
"It's been a long time since I've seen him."
"Of course I'm happy to see you."
"The world belongs to those who get up early."
"This is why we created the Hope Project."
"I mistook you for one of them."
"Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King."
"I need advisors who know the modern world."
"Do you think this is the right thing to do?"
"We have eyes bigger than our stomachs."
"I saw what you did to him."
"Don't you think we should talk about this?"
"I want you to do something for me."
"I did what you asked me to do."
"How long have you been here?"
"What are you doing on TV?"
"Yes, that's what I always thought."
"For the first time, we completely agree."
"He was the one who pushed me to come."
"My mere memory drove him from this castle."
"You'll give me two round trips in first class."
"You have to think about the headlines."
"I need one of their personal belongings."
"Go back to your parents' house, I'll call you there."
"What are we going to do with you?"
"I'm glad you told me."
"People think Stokes has new ideas."
"I've never seen you with a girl."
"She will have neither my food nor my son."
"That's why you pay us so much."
"These are the drugs you were given."
"He had quite a few in his youth."
"I think I was lucky."
"This is the first question that came to me."
"You've never heard me so close."
"Do you know who opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
"We were the ones who wanted to buy him a caravan."
"After all I've done for you?"
"Come on kids, who wants to get their fingerprints taken?"
"Can I keep this one at home?"
"How come the judge isn't coming?"
"By the way, a Mr. Chow called for you."
"Sorry, I forgot to buy you something to eat."
"What do you think about all this?"
"What brings you to Santa Rosa?"
"What's taking him so long?"
"I hope she knows what she's doing."
"By telling you this, I have particular confidence in you."
"Like you, I have a passion for antiques."
"I told you what happened."
"I guess he wanted you all to himself."
"Do you remember what you said?"
"Please do as he says."
"This promise is about to become reality."
"I hope that's not the case."
"A very insightful choice, if I may say so, Madam."
"You didn't tell me you were coming."
"They did a great job on me."
"I always wondered if it was real."
"I think it's time to call Tracy."
"No, that's not what I wanted."
"Is that why you called me?"
"Is that why you called me?"
"Do you know how many I've seen as a cop?"
"But what did I do to you?"
"I told you I had a plan."
"Have you told this girl your feelings?"
"Men don't need to be attractive."
"I took some on my wedding day."
"We'll explain, but we have to go now."
"And that's exactly what we're going to do."
"Would you mind not seeing me anymore?"
"How can we contact you if needed?"
"Didn't I see you in the women's clothing?"
"Only the power of the Grail can heal your father."
"I told them everything I knew."
"Don't you see what's going on here?"
"That's why I did this."
"You were great, in plays, at school."
"Do you know what capitalism is?"
"Does this make sense to you?"
"I didn't expect this from you."
"I did what I thought was right."
"What would you like me to do?"
"Are you the one hiding in the attic?"
"Maybe one day I'll ask you for a favor."
"Is that the best you can do?"
"So what can I do to win the case?"
"You will hold on until you are relieved."
"I helped Norman put her in the coffin."
"How can you grow up in the midst of all this?"
"No, I'm too old to be your husband."
"I wonder how much he invested in this."
"It's someone else's stuff."
"This is the third time I've seen him."
"He's going to take you on a trip by train."
"There are other fish in the sea."
"We're lucky to have found each other."
"This will be the centerpiece of our Spanish collection."
"Sleep is what we need."
"This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
"You did all you could."
"You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience."
"That's the only thing I'm sure of."
"Your mother, on the other hand, I admired."
"She had talked about ending her life?"
"I'll tell you what to do."
"What are you doing in my office?"
"So what are you going to do now?"
"We both need a drink."
"God told me what you must do."
"What brings you to the area?"
"Your father was obsessed with nothing but his work."
"It's the maid's day off."
"Do you have something to say?"
"There is something we need to talk about."
"Hopefully we can go to bed early."
"People earn their living however they want."
"This kid, Brendan Harris, thought he'd find her at the store."
"I'll come back with your little slice of pie."
"All I want is a truce."
"When you think about your superiors, how do you feel?"
"And now we're going to look for him."
"I told him to go to hell."
"There must be a reason for his presence."
"Is that how you see it?"
"The people you meet on the flight are your friends."
"When was the last time you saw her?"
"I just hope he doesn't take advantage of it."
"Raise your hand and your friends will see the game."
"Did my wife tell you that?"
"You all understand who this is."
"What you did to him spoke to me."
"It's time to know what you believe in."
"Like the monkey ready to go into space."
"You called me to put you up."
"Show me what you've got."
"Nobody knows, but they saw it."
"Well, take good care of yourself and be good."
"No, it didn't happen like that."
"Thank you for what you did for me."
"What are we going to do with this?"
"Tony and I are like brothers, right?"
"No, I don't know what it is."
"Everything will be okay, I promise."
"There are people who are counting on me."
"After a little pill, she will love me again."
"I believe I have the right to know."
"Please tell me what I already know."
"Where did you last see him?"
"It's the best day of his life."
"Aren't you saying goodbye to me?"
"I feel very comfortable with you."
"If someone hits you, you hit them back."
"It's on the other side of the river."
"That's how I became a journalist."
"We are free to do what we want."
"I think I have to go."
"Do you know what he said about you?"
"I reserved a table at Clair de Terre."
"By giving orders and commanding?"
"What's in your eye?"
"Please know that you will always be welcome with us."
"When you're married, you can get away with anything."
"What are these salads?"
"Call me if you need anything."
"I order you to cancel this mission."
"Not for the guy who designed the building."
"This old man deserves a little rest."
"I taught you everything you know."
"We talk about everyday life."
"I do everything in my power."
"I will take a tenant with me to recognize her."
"How do you know they don't write to me?"
"Let's go to the station, if you don't mind."
"After all I've done for her."
"What effect will this have on the baby?"
"You will tell me everything you know."
"What is it, my love?"
"Life is just a game of chance."
"Nadia has given us proof of goodwill."
"But you have to be there from time to time."
"What happened to yours, sister?"
"He knew everything except the name of this city."
"You will overcome this because you are a man."
"How did I come to live with Tyler?"
"You will order the princess to marry me."
"Is there anyone on this frequency?"
"I never said I was."
"Tell him to let go of me, please."
"The role of a young and happy future mother."
"Tell yourself it's a marriage of convenience."
"Put yourself in my shoes and make a decision."
"Have I been Tyler longer and longer?"
"And what did she tell you?"
"It is more than the value of our work."
"Please, I can't right now."
"I take this very seriously."
"Can you tell me what it is?"
"A little over a year ago."
"You kept talking about a wedding."
"Is that all you wanted to tell me?"
"And I saw the letter from the bank."
"You're going to have to keep me up all night."
"My father went to see this conductor."
"By the way, I have a favor to ask of you."
"Did he know Ray had reported him?"
"Did he say what it was about?"
"Imitate the signature of the Head of Records, Third Department."
"Perhaps the world is not made."
"I'd keep my eyes open, if I were you."
"The heart has its reasons that reason ignores."
"Do you understand a word I'm saying?"
"Do you want to eat the chicken all by yourself?"
"How do I deserve this generosity?"
"The more people the better."
"You only talk about cooking and bed."
"We take the plane and they are yours."
"No one knows if this is true or not."
"You mentioned service, are you a nurse?"
"They are fighting for the future of humanity."
"Sounds like a good plan to me."
"There was a dream called Rome."
"And that's exactly what happened."
"I brought him here, and I said nothing."
"There's no chance he'll survive?"
"When was the last time you saw him?"
"Is that what you're trying to tell me?"
"And you, what did you do?"
"Who's the guy with her?"
"All human beings live the same way."
"You get along well with the journalist, lucky you?"
"She flew to see me."
"Did something happen between you two?"
"I'll tell you what you want to know."
"How did he know you'd be at that movie?"
"Okay, I'll see what I can do."
"That's all he told me."
"And this is how you thank me?"
"And this is how you thank me?"
"It's called Philosophy of Time Travel."
"Do you mind if I join you?"
"If he comes back, I'll let you know with a flash."
"Would you like to eat some pie with me?"
"Take a nice bath when you get home, think a little."
"All these men have a price on their heads."
"Come on, I found a great viewpoint."
"You never told your mother about it."
"Your people have a high opinion of Commander Lawrence?"
"Would you like to recover the little girl's body?"
"I need to talk to someone about this."
"You'll know once we do business."
"And that means more to you than life."
"They're making a film about him with these cameras."
"I saw you coming out of the sorting center."
"Are you sure this is a good idea?"
"You and your guys will be working with Omar."
"All under the responsibility of your precious Arab Council."
"Doctor, we don't have time for this anymore."
"Are you sure this is the right address?"
"I feel like I know you well."
"They go through everything, they talk to the fans."
"Do you want to go to her house for spaghetti?"
"You said his apartment looked like mine."
"What matters is you and your son."
"Did you hear what I just said?"
"I told you not to touch that."
"What do I tell my dad about the car?"
"I am now a CIA double agent."
"Besides being nice, I am very genuine."
"No, he didn't win this time."
"It's something to think about."
"I just want to tell you that I love you."
"Are we forced to listen to this elevator music?"
"I'll tell you all my adventures in detail."
"That's a nice way to look at it."
"Can't you see I'm on the phone?"
"Nice to meet you, and thank you for that."
"I saw everything that happened."
"Do you know what it's like these days?"
"I dream of seeing what TV is like elsewhere."
"How can you get so big eating this?"
"That's what comes to mind."
"To persuade you not to resist the transfer."
"No, it's not what you think."
"Is that a fair summary of our relationship, Tyler?"
"I need you to be there for me."
"I'll tell you when I have a country."
"But I think you're here on business."
"Did you hear what he said, Saul?"
"Your father would have been proud, may he rest in peace."
"You three, put the remaining ones in their cage."
"Are you going to tell me what happened?"
"Do you hear what you are saying?"
"When are you coming home?"
"I told him not to go."
"Did you see what they did to me?"
"What is it, my boy?"
"What are you going to do in Vegas without your brother?"
"Gypsies like to have a drink at the wake."
"Good God, what's gotten into you?"
"There must be an explanation for all this."
"My daughter says you are half Jewish?"
"My wife and I are happy with little."
"Go to the shield generator."
"Would someone please tell me who you are?"
"They are yours for a measure of rice."
"She's not here, is she?"
"What's taking you so long?"
"These men are part of the pavilion, just like you."
"I will be moving to a community in Vermont."
"Now there are two of us in this wolf pack."
"It was me you had on the phone."
"You couldn't do head, body, head?"
"Everyone still talks about it, especially my brother."
"Don't you think the evidence is thin?"
"Do you think we can be satisfied with memories?"
"I saw him at the restaurant right away."
"It has been seen that I have great talent."
"You never wanted any friends, brother."
"Oh, what is this?"
"Are you sure we're in the right place?"
"You took the words right out of my mouth."
"You took the words right out of my mouth."
"I'm glad you came with me."
"I've tried to tell you so many times."
"But you already knew that, didn't you?"
"That's good, because my taxi has left."
"I will do everything to make up for what happened."
"I almost asked you for my birthday."
"Show me that thing that serves as a hat."
"Led, I remind you, by an English officer."
"He changed his name to hide his misdeeds."
"What's good for you, honey?"
"You never know what you're going to get."
"Once there, you will be my right-hand man."
"I needed to build my career smoothly."
"I don't think so, but I want to be sure."
"And where did you get this cop box from?"
"They take everything you have on you."
"And that's why I have to go."
"I never asked you to do this."
"You're going to force me to make a comeback."
"He washes the bathroom walls."
"There is something you should see."
