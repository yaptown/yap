{"sentence":"Hors jeu.","issues":["Missing hyphen: the standard form is 'hors-jeu'.","Punctuation: as an interjection, an exclamation mark is more natural than a period.","Typographic note: in French, there is normally a (non-breaking) space before '!' — shown here as a regular space."],"corrected_sentence":"Hors-jeu !"}
{"sentence":"Puis moi.","issues":["Fragmentary — not a complete sentence in standard register","Unnatural use of « puis » without « et » or additional context","Potentially confusing for learners (ambiguous meaning)"],"corrected_sentence":null}
{"sentence":"Ligne deux.","issues":["Missing definite article 'La' (normally 'La ligne deux' or 'La ligne 2')","Fragment rather than a complete sentence — acceptable as a label but potentially confusing for learners","Uncommon written form: signage/labels usually use the numeral (2) or 'n° 2' rather than the word 'deux'"],"corrected_sentence":"La ligne deux."}
{"sentence":"Bonnes questions.","issues":["Omission of the determiner 'de' makes the phrase unidiomatic for a standalone sentence.","Adjective–noun order is fine, but learners may be confused because French usually requires a determiner (e.g. \"de bonnes questions\").","Could be interpreted as a fragment or a headline rather than a full sentence."],"corrected_sentence":"De bonnes questions."}
{"sentence":"Pas bonnes.","issues":["Fragment: missing subject and verb (e.g. 'Elles ne sont pas bonnes.')","Ambiguous: unclear what 'bonnes' refers to (which feminine plural noun?)","Not appropriate as an isolated sentence for language learners"],"corrected_sentence":null}
{"sentence":"Sur papier.","issues":["Missing definite article: standard idiom is 'sur le papier' rather than 'sur papier'.","Fragmentary — not a complete sentence on its own and likely confusing for learners."],"corrected_sentence":"Sur le papier."}
{"sentence":"Des deux.","issues":["Fragmentary/incomplete — lacks context to determine meaning","Ambiguous use of 'des' (could be the plural indefinite article or contraction of 'de + les')","Potentially confusing for learners because it's unclear whether the speaker means 'both' (les deux), 'one of the two' (l'un des deux) or 'of the two' as part of a larger phrase"],"corrected_sentence":null}
{"sentence":"Pas ensemble.","issues":["Elliptical fragment: no subject or verb (e.g., \"Nous ne sommes pas ensemble\").","Omits the formal negative particle \"ne\", so it reflects informal/spoken register.","Could be confusing for learners expecting a full sentence."],"corrected_sentence":null}
{"sentence":"Sur vous ?","issues":["Elliptical/fragmentary: lacks context to determine exact meaning","Potentially confusing for learners because multiple interpretations are possible (e.g. \"C'est sur vous ?\" = \"Is it on you?\", \"Et sur vous ?\" = \"And you?\")"],"corrected_sentence":null}
{"sentence":"Comment pouvait gagner Tom ?","issues":["Mauvais ordre des mots pour une question en français : «Comment pouvait gagner Tom ?» est incorrect.","Il manque l'inversion sujet-verbe ou une construction avec «est-ce que» (ex. «Comment Tom pouvait-il gagner ?» ou «Comment est-ce que Tom pouvait gagner ?»).","Le choix du temps est ambigu : pour «How could Tom have won?» il est plus naturel d'utiliser le passé composé avec «pu» («Comment Tom a-t-il pu gagner ?»).","Ce n'est pas un simple problème typographique mais une erreur grammaticale de structure interrogative."],"corrected_sentence":null}
