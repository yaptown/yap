//! Usage & collocation discovery over cached token embeddings.
//!
//! A "usage" is a pedagogical unit, not a dictionary sense: two usages of a
//! gram are distinct exactly when a teacher would introduce them to a
//! learner one at a time rather than together. That deliberately includes
//! grammatical constructions (French "ils sont ..." vs the inverted
//! "sont-ils ...?") and conversational formulas (sentence-final "non ?" as
//! a confirmation tag) alongside genuine polysemy — each usage carries a
//! `kind` (meaning / construction / formula) so downstream consumers can
//! treat the categories differently.
//!
//! Mines every gram's occurrence cloud for cluster structure (recursive
//! 2-means plus HDBSCAN on large clouds — both purely geometric, tuned to
//! over-propose), then has an LLM adjudicate each gram in a single call.
//! Clusters organize the judge's reading material and pick which grams are
//! worth judging, but the unit of judgment is the *line*: the judge defines
//! the gram's usage inventory and labels every clearly-classifiable line
//! with the usage (or fixed expression) it shows. Line-level labels are
//! what make the artifacts trustworthy where cluster-level grouping was
//! not: clusters overlap (an HDBSCAN cluster can carve a subset out of a
//! 2-means leaf) and big background clusters are usually mixtures, so any
//! per-cluster verdict inherits their double counting and mislabeling.
//! The labeled lines ("gold") then drive a purely geometric extension:
//! per-usage centroids classify every occurrence in the cloud, yielding a
//! true partition with honest counts, a leave-one-out agreement score per
//! usage, and per-occurrence corpus labels. The same anchors + centroid
//! machinery classifies the gram's occurrences in *arbitrary* sentences
//! later (see [`usage_centroids`] and [`InventoryCentroids::classify`]) — anchors
//! are stored as (sentence, spans) rather than raw vectors, so they can be
//! re-embedded under any future embedding model.
//!
//! The expression lane is unchanged in spirit: contextual embeddings give a
//! word inside a fixed expression a tight, distinctive cluster, so geometry
//! alone cannot tell polysemy from collocation membership — the judge sees
//! both interpretations at once (e.g. "au clair" splitting into "au clair
//! de lune" vs "tirer au clair" has zero usages of its own, just two host
//! expressions). Writes files under `generate-data/data/{lang}/` that feed
//! the next generate-data run directly — there is no human review step, so
//! the judges are the quality bar:
//!
//! - `usage_inventories.jsonl`: grams with two or more usages, each usage
//!   with kind, gloss, gold + assigned counts, LOO agreement, and anchor
//!   sentences. Also writes per-occurrence labels for the whole corpus to
//!   `out/{lang}/usage_labels.jsonl` (inspection + downstream labeling).
//! - `discovered_multiword_terms.jsonl`: grounded, novel, frequent
//!   expressions (the LLM only cites lines and copies verbatim substrings;
//!   surface forms, gram sequences, and corpus counts are derived here)
//!   that a final per-expression opacity judgment deemed worth learning as
//!   a unit — the adjudicator reports even compositional patterns (to keep
//!   their lines out of the usage gold), and the opacity stage is what
//!   keeps "dire merci"-class free combinations out of the vocabulary.
//!
//! Grams are treated as opaque identities throughout: an occurrence is a
//! token of the encoder's gram stream — an exact instance of its gram, so
//! every point in a cloud is truly the key (multiword matches are
//! lemma-loosened and contribute no occurrences; they only claim their
//! words) — its vector is the mean of the cached vectors of the heteronym
//! words it covers, and extracted expressions are sequences of grams. No
//! linguistic re-analysis (lemmas, POS grouping) happens here — whatever
//! units the gram system defines are the units mined.
//!
//! Run by the standalone `usage_discovery` binary; nothing in the main
//! generate-data pipeline consumes these files except
//! `wiktionary_terms::extra_multiword_terms`, which folds the discovered
//! terms into the next run's multiword-term inventory as-is.

        balanced enough to form visible clusters. A word whose second usage is \
        real but rarer slips right through — French \u{ab}quartier\u{bb} is \
        almost always 'neighborhood' in everyday speech, so the clustering never \
        notices \u{ab}pas de quartier !\u{bb}. Those are the words we would like \
        your help finding, since you can simply know them rather than having to \
        see them. Every word you name that occurs in our corpus gets its \

        would want introduced separately: a literal meaning plus an idiomatic or \
        figurative one, a noun that doubles as an interjection or form of \

        "You are auditing a language-learning vocabulary built from a {language} \
        sentence corpus. What we have done is taken all the known occurrences of a \
        certain vocabulary item (a word or phrase), embedded them with an embedding \
        model, then clustered them. The goal is to split the vocabulary item into \
        distinct usages, so that we can introduce each usage to learners \
        separately. Unfortunately, the embedding models are not perfect at this, \
        which is where you come in. We would like you to work out the item's \
        distinct usages, label the example lines with them, and report any fixed \
        expressions you notice along the way.\n\
        \n\
        In each request the target item is marked \u{ab}like this\u{bb} in its \
        sentence, and the lines are numbered across all clusters so you can cite \
        them. The clustering is imperfect in shape as well: one usage may be \
        split across several clusters, clusters may overlap — a small cluster \
        can carve a subset out of a larger one — and a large cluster is often \
        really a mixture of several usages, so please judge each line on its \
        own rather than assuming a cluster is uniform. The embedding features, \
        and therefore the resulting input clusters, often reflect superficial \
        features like sentence length, punctuation, or surrounding formality \
        rather than a difference in usage, which is one reason why merges can \
        be necessary. After the clusters there is a random sample drawn from \
        all occurrences; it shows the item's overall distribution, which the \
        clusters by themselves can misrepresent.\n\
        \n\
        Usages: Definitely report separate usages for distinct meanings — distinct \
        enough that a learner would treat them as different vocabulary items and \
        they would usually receive different translations in another language \
        (homonyms like bank=money/river, or strong polysemy like \
        paper=material/newspaper). Some of the input will show splits that only \
        vary slightly in topic, register, or inflection, but where the usage is \
        the same. Those lines should be labeled as one usage. And there is a \
        final category, where the meaning really is slightly different, but might \
        not ordinarily be seen as different. For example, in French it is common \
        to say \"non\" to literally mean \"no\", but at the end of a sentence \
        \"non ?\" can mean something like \"don't you think?\". Even though it's \
        natural, learners would probably still benefit from learning it and seeing \
        examples of it, because it's not totally obvious to a language learner \
        that \"non\" would be used this way. So that case also deserves its own \
        usage. On the other hand, you can merge if the usage seems so similar that \
        there's no real reason to teach them separately. For example, the word \
        \"ending\" in \"the road is ending\" vs \"the story is ending\" means \
        basically the same thing — we are reaching the end. These can be grouped, \
        as it is very unlikely that a learner would even benefit from learning \
        them separately.\n\
        \n\
        The overall test is pedagogical rather than lexicographic. Ask yourself: \
        if I were going to teach this word to someone learning the language, \
        would I find it helpful to introduce these ways of using it one at a \
        time, or are they similar enough that it makes more sense to teach them \
        together? A usage does not have to be a distinct dictionary sense — \
        grammatical patterns count too. French \"ils sont ...\" vs the inverted \
        question \"sont-ils ... ?\" is worth introducing separately even though \
        \"ils\" refers to the same people in both: a learner who has only met \
        one pattern will stumble on the other. The same goes for a word negating \
        a verb vs the same word standing alone as an answer. Your judgement in \
        deciding when to split into different usages and when to group \
        occurrences into one usage is appreciated.\n\
        \n\
        To help us organize the results, please tag each usage with a kind: \
        \"meaning\" when a different thing is meant (the bank and paper cases), \
        \"construction\" when it is the same core meaning appearing in a \
        distinct grammatical pattern (the sont-ils inversion, or verb negation \
        vs a standalone answer), and \"formula\" when the item is serving as a \
        conversational routine — a greeting, a term of address, a discourse \
        marker that moves the conversation along, an exclamation, or a \
        confirmation tag like the sentence-final \"non ?\". Don't agonize over \
        a borderline kind; the usages themselves matter more than their tags.\n\
        \n\
        For each usage, cite the numbers of all the lines that show it, \
        including lines from the random sample. We use your line labels as \
        anchors to automatically classify every other occurrence in the corpus, \
        so it matters that every cited line really does show its usage — when a \
        line is ambiguous between usages, garbled, or doesn't fit any usage, \
        the right thing to do is leave it uncited. Uncited lines are simply set \
        aside, so an incoherent cluster needs no special treatment: just don't \
        cite its lines. And if the whole item is really one usage, reporting a \
        single usage covering its lines is a perfectly good outcome — that \
        tells us not to split it.\n\
        \n\
        Expressions: The above directives refer to cases where a word individually \
        has multiple usages, but sometimes a word takes on a new meaning when \
        it's a component of a fixed expression. This can range from the opaque, \
        like the \"high\" in \"high school\", to the relatively transparent, like \
        \"god\" in \"god willing\". In these cases, it is true that \"high\" and \
        \"god\" mean something slightly different from usual, but the best way to \
        explain this to users is not to say that \"high\" has some sense relating \
        to schools or something, but to just say that \"high\" has usages like \
        \"vertically elevated\", \"inebriated\", and also participates in fixed \
        expressions like \"high school\". Even when a pattern is very \
        compositional and transparent, such as \"god willing\", it's still \
        beneficial to report it, because fluency requires that a language learner \
        already be familiar with such patterns, and we must be aware of them if \
        we are to explicitly teach them. One caveat: an expression needs at \
        least two actual words — a single word with a characteristic position \
        or punctuation, like the sentence-final \"non ?\", should be reported \
        as a usage of that word instead. A line where the item only appears as \
        part of a fixed expression should be cited on that expression rather \
        than on a usage, since it isn't really evidence of a separate usage of \
        the word.\n\
        \n\
        One practical note about reporting expressions. We can only use an \
        expression if we can find it in the corpus ourselves: we take exactly \
        what you write and look for it in the lines you cited, so the safest \
        thing is to copy the expression directly out of one of the numbered \
        lines, without tidying it up or converting it to a dictionary form — if \
        what you write doesn't appear in the cited line word-for-word, we won't \
        be able to find it, and the expression will unfortunately be lost. Along \
        with the expression itself, cite the numbers of the lines you saw it on. \
        If the same pattern appears in several inflected forms, one entry \
        covering the pattern is enough. And a pattern that only ever appears on \
        one line is too little evidence for us to do anything with, so it isn't \
        worth reporting.\n\
        \n\
        For the usages, please write the gloss in {language}. Feel free to put \
        some thoughts in the thoughts field \
        (in English) — that will help us understand your reasoning for your \
        decisions."

        The mining copies an expression verbatim out of whatever sentence it was \
        found in, so it often arrives frozen in one person, tense, or pronoun even \
        though the phrase itself is more general: French \"me suis occupé de\" for \
        what a dictionary would list as \"s'occuper de\", English \"God help me\" \

        \n\

        other persons, the other clitics, the ordinary tenses. Write each one as a \
        complete surface form that could appear in a sentence rather than a \
        template with a placeholder in it: the forms are matched mechanically \
        against the corpus and any that does not occur there is dropped, so a \
        placeholder can never match anything. Include the expression you were \
        shown when it is itself one of the instantiations.\n\
        \n\
        If the expression is already general — nothing in it stands in for an open \
        slot or agrees with a subject — leave the citation empty and the variant \
        list empty. Most fixed expressions genuinely admit no variation, so an \
