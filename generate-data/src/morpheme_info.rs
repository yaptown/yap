Please don't quote the affix itself in the label (e.g. no "-요", "-ed", "-ment") — the learner already sees the affix in the UI, so the label just needs to describe its function. Pronouns like "je/tu" are fine when they make the description clearer. Examples:

- "polite ending" rather than "POLITE"
- "past participle" rather than "PTCP.PST"

Prefer a terse (but still informative) label over an exhaustive list of every syncretic reading. These labels are for students studying a language, not linguists. If a word can be used for 1st person and 2nd person, that's important, but (for example) if a word can be used for the present tense and also the prophetic future tense, the present tense is the only one that really needs to be mentioned.

Note that you can trust the tags to be accurate. If a tag says the suffix is used for the present tense and the future tense, please trust it, even if that's not universally true. The app will only show your response to the user in cases where the tag applies."#
