# Japanese: Sudachi, not spaCy
#
# Japanese used to be analyzed by an LLM from scratch, which made it the only language
# without a deterministic proposer — and it showed: gold disagreed with itself on 1.39% of
# tokens against German's 0.02%, and carved the same construction four different ways
# (ノック|し|て|いる, 到着|し|た, 終了|し|ました, 作って|い|ます).
#
# Split mode C is deliberate. Mode A strands bound morphemes that are not words — お|金,
# 図書|館, フランス|語 — which violates the rule that every token must be showable to a
# learner with a definition. C keeps those whole. Measured against gold's self-consistent
# subset, C scores 95.0 boundary F1 against UniDic/mode-A's 94.2.
#
# What Sudachi does NOT do is merge a predicate with its auxiliary chain — 食べ|まし|た stays
# split in every mode. That is applied downstream by JapaneseCorrector, and stated in the
# tokenization policy the LLM is given.
SUDACHI_SPLIT_MODE = "C"

# Sudachi's tagset is Japanese-specific and hierarchical; UPOS is the 17-tag cross-lingual
# set. The correspondence is nearly mechanical — 32 distinct keys cover our whole corpus,
# and this table agrees with gold on 94.9% of tokens. The residual is mostly cases the LLM
# is *supposed* to change (今日 as NOUN vs ADV depending on use), which is the point of
# having it review the proposal.
