<ul><li>In its general sense, <i>come</i> specifically marks motion <span class="Latn" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/towards#English" title="towards">towards</a></span> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deixis" class="extiw" title="w:Deixis">deictic</a> centre, (whether explicitly stated or not). Its counterpart, usually referring to motion away from or not involving the deictic centre, is <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/go#English" title="go">go</a></i>. For example, the sentence "Come to the tree" implies contextually that the speaker is already at the tree — "Go to the tree" often implies that the speaker is elsewhere. Either the speaker or the listener can be the deictic centre — the sentences "I will go to you" and "I will come to you" are both valid, depending on the exact nuances of the context. When there is no clear speaker or listener, the deictic centre is usually the focus of the sentence or the topic of the piece of writing. "Millions of people <b>came</b> to America from Europe" would be used in an article about America, but "Millions of people <b>went</b> to America from Europe" would be used in an article about Europe.</li></ul>
<ul><li>When used with adverbs of location, <i>come</i> is usually paired with <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/here#English" title="here">here</a></i> or <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/hither#English" title="hither">hither</a></i>. In interrogatives, <i>come</i> usually indicates a question about source — "Where are you coming from?" — while <i>go</i> indicates a question about destination — "Where are you going?" or "Where are you going to?"</li></ul>
<ul><li>A few old texts use <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/comen#English" title="comen">comen</a></i> as the past participle. Also, in some dialects, like rural Scots and rural Midlands dialects, the form <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/comen#English" title="comen">comen</a></i> is still occasionally in use, so phrases like the following can still be encountered there — <i>Sa thoo bist comen heyr to nim min 'orse frae mee, then?</i> <span class="IPA nowrap">[sä ðuː bɪst cʊmn̩ hiər tə nɪm miːn ɔːrs frə miː | d̪ɛn]</span> (so you have come here to steal my horse from me, then?).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Formerly the verb <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/be#English" title="be">be</a></i> was used as the auxiliary instead of <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/have#English" title="have">have</a></i>, for example, <i>Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and <b>are</b> come to worship him.</i></li></ul>
<ul><li>The phrase "dream come true" is a set phrase; the verb "come" in the sense "become" is archaic outside of some set phrases like <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/come_about#English" title="come about">come about</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/come_alive#English" title="come alive">come alive</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/come_clean#English" title="come clean">come clean</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/w/index.php?title=come_loose&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="come loose (page does not exist)">come loose</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/come_true#English" title="come true">come true</a></i> and <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/come_undone#English" title="come undone">come undone</a></i>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The collocations <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/come_with#English" title="come with">come with</a></i> and <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/come_along#English" title="come along">come along</a></i> mean <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/accompany#English" title="accompany">accompany</a></i>, used as "Do you want to come with me?" and "Do you want to come along?" In the Midwestern American dialect, "come with" can occur without a following object, as in "Do you want to come with?" In this dialect, "with" can also be used in this way with some other verbs, such as "take with". Examples of this may be found in plays by Chicagoan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet" class="extiw" title="w:David Mamet">David Mamet</a>, such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Buffalo" class="extiw" title="w:American Buffalo">American Buffalo</a>.</i><sup id="cite&#95;ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> This objectless use is not permissible in other dialects.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The meaning in the sense of <i>to ejaculate</i> or <i>orgasm</i> is often considered vulgar slang. Many style guides and editors recommend the spelling <i>come</i> for verb uses while strictly allowing the spelling <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/cum#English" title="cum">cum</a></i> for the noun. Both spellings are sometimes found in either the noun or verb sense, however. Others prefer to distinguish in formality, using <i>come</i> for any formal usage and <i>cum</i> only in slang, erotic or pornographic contexts.<sup id="cite&#95;ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup></li></ul>

<ul><li>The meaning of <i>semen or female ejaculatory discharge</i> is considered vulgar slang. Many style guides and editors recommend the spelling <i>come</i> for verb uses while strictly allowing the spelling <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/cum#English" title="cum">cum</a></i> for the noun. Both spellings are sometimes found in either the noun or verb sense, however.
