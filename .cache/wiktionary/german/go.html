<ul><li>Along with <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/do#English" title="do">do</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/make#English" title="make">make</a></i>, and to a lesser extent other English verbs, <i>go</i> is often used as a substitute for a verb that was used previously or that is implied, in the same way a <a href="/wiki/pronoun" title="pronoun">pronoun</a> substitutes for a <a href="/wiki/noun" title="noun">noun</a>. For example:
<dl><dd><i>Chris: Then he <b>goes</b> like this:</i> (Chris then waves his arms around, implying that the phrase means <i>then he waves his arms</i>).</dd></dl></li>
<li>Some speakers use <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/went#English" title="went">went</a></i> for the past participle, especially in informal contexts, though this is considered <a href="/wiki/Appendix:Glossary#nonstandard" title="Appendix:Glossary">nonstandard</a> and is <a href="/wiki/Appendix:Glossary#proscribed" title="Appendix:Glossary">proscribed</a>.</li>
<li>Like other English verbs, the verb <i>go</i> once had an alternative present participle formed with the suffix <i><a href="/wiki/-and" title="-and">-and</a></i>, i.e. <i><a href="/wiki/goand" title="goand">goand</a></i>. <i><a href="/wiki/goand" title="goand">Goand</a></i> is now <a href="/wiki/obsolete" title="obsolete">obsolete</a>, having been replaced by <i><a href="/wiki/going" title="going">going</a></i>, except in a few rural dialects in Scotland and Northern England, where it is considered <a href="/wiki/archaic" title="archaic">archaic</a>. Even in such dialects, it is never used to form the continuous tenses. These examples are from the <a href="/wiki/Highlands" title="Highlands">Highlands</a>:

<li>In certain contexts, <i>been</i> is idiomatically substituted for <i>gone</i> as the past participle. For example, one might <i>go</i> to London but later say that one has <i>been</i> to London. One might also say that one will <i>go</i> to the toilet but later say that one has <i>been</i> to the toilet.</li></ul>
