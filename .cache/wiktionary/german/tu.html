<ul><li>When more pronouns are included in the same sentence, it is considered somewhat impolite to say the pronoun <i class="Latn mention" lang="fr"><a href="/wiki/moi#French" title="moi">moi</a></i> first, <a href="/wiki/etiquette" title="etiquette">etiquette</a> says it must be the last one, and <i class="Latn mention" lang="fr"><a href="/wiki/toi#French" title="toi">toi</a></i> must be said after a third person:
<ul><li><i>Rose, toi et moi irons là-bas.</i>, “Rose, you and I will go there.”</li></ul></li>
<li>"Tu" is used to address one person in an informal situation. Older people tend to exclusively use it with familiar people, and do not use it with unfamiliar adults unless invited to; but younger people use this pronoun much more, using it together in any informal situation, even if they don't know each other. Using "vous" in this context will be seen as old-fashioned and distant.</li>
<li>"Tu" is not typically used in formal settings such as business meetings and never in court, regardless of the relationship between the speaker and the listener.</li>
<li>Using "vous" when "tu" would be more appropriate will come across as rigid and awkward; however, using "tu" when "vous" would be more appropriate could come over as deliberate disrespect. For this reason, as a rule of thumb, it is advised to use "vous" if in doubt, as it is "all-encompassing".</li>
<li>Children are always addressed using "tu" – <a href="/wiki/vous" title="vous">vous</a> would come over as comical. In elementary, middle, and high schools, teachers address students using "tu", but students address teachers using <a href="/wiki/vous" title="vous">vous</a>*. In higher education usage of <a href="/wiki/vous" title="vous">vous</a> becomes more common in both directions.</li>
<li>In formal written communication to any adult, use <a href="/wiki/vous" title="vous">vous</a>. Not doing so may come over as unprofessional at best, deliberately disrespectful at worst.</li>
<li>However, depending on the region or type of school, other norms may be more used in place. For example, in Quebec (not the rest of Canada), it is more common for students to use "tu" with their teachers.<sup id="cite&#95;ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup></li></ul>

<p><sup>1</sup> The disjunctive (tonic) forms are also used after an explicit preposition (<i>de/d’</i>, <i>à</i>, <i>pour</i>, <i>chez</i>, <i>dans</i>, <i>vers</i>, <i>sur</i>, <i>sous</i>, ...), instead the accusative, dative, genitive, locative, or reflexive forms, where a preposition is implied.<br />
<sup>2</sup> <i>Il</i> is also used as an impersonal nominative-only pronoun.<br />
<sup>3</sup> <i>On</i> can also function as a first person plural (although agreeing with third person singular verb forms).<br />
<sup>4</sup> The nominal indeterminate form <i>ce</i> (demonstrative) can also be used with the auxiliary verb <i>être</i> as a plural, instead of the proximal or distal gendered forms.<br />
<sup>5</sup> The reflexive third person singular forms (<i>se</i> or <i>s’</i>) for accusative or dative are also used as third person plural reflexive.<br />
<sup>6</sup> <i>Vous</i> is also used as the polite singular form, in which case the plural disjunctive tonic <i>vous-mêmes</i> becomes singular <i>vous-même</i>.<br />
<sup>7</sup> <i>Ils</i>, <i>eux</i> and <i>eux-mêmes</i> are also used when a group has a mixture of masculine and feminine members.<br />

<ul><li>With Italian being a <a href="/wiki/pro-drop_language" title="pro-drop language">pro-drop language</a>, subject pronouns are mostly omitted, both in the written and spoken language, as the inflected verb is conjugated by person. An example would be: <i>Mangi una mela</i>, which is much more common than <i><b>Tu</b> mangi una mela</i>, where the subject can be inferred from the inflected form <i>mangi</i>&#160;; similarly <i>È carina</i> instead of <i><b>Lei</b> è carina</i>. The explicit usage of personal pronouns may sound redundant to a native speaker, except when it is used in order to emphasize the subject. (<i><b>Tu</b> mangi una mela</i> could be interpreted as <i><b>You</b> are eating an apple and I am not</i>)..</li>
<li>The second-person pronoun in particular can sound confidential and, in some cases, even impolite.</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Tu</i> has fallen out of use in some regions of Brazil, including most of the Southeast and the Centre-West, where "<a href="/wiki/voc%C3%AA" title="você">você</a>" has taken its place. It is still very commonly used in various regions of the country though, such as most of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Catarina" title="Santa Catarina">Santa Catarina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul" title="Rio Grande do Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, parts of <a href="/wiki/Paran%C3%A1" title="Paraná">Paraná</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> city and most of the <a href="/wiki/Northeast" title="Northeast">Northeast</a> and <a href="/wiki/North" title="North">North</a> regions. It should be noted that in <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> the pronoun is frequently employed interchangeably with <a href="/wiki/voc%C3%AA" title="você">você</a>. Despite the media's preference for "você", the usage of "tu" seems to have been gaining ground throughout the last few decades in Rio (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=262528">[11]</a>, a linguistic research on the topic in Portuguese), being most frequent among younger speakers.</li>
<li>According to grammars, <i>tu</i> should always take second person singular verbs, as is the case in Portugal and some parts of Brazil. However, in most Brazilian dialects which employ <i>tu</i>, it now takes third person singular verbs, like <i>você</i>.</li></ul>
