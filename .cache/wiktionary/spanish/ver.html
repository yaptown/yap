<p>This is one of three verbs to have an irregular indicative imperfect, alongside <i class="Latn mention" lang="es"><a href="/wiki/ser#Spanish" title="ser">ser</a></i> and <i class="Latn mention" lang="es"><a href="/wiki/ir#Spanish" title="ir">ir</a></i>. <i>Ver'</i>s imperfect is a remnant of the Old Spanish <i class="Latn mention" lang="es"><a href="/wiki/veer#Spanish" title="veer">veer</a></i> (only the stem <i>ve-</i> is irregular, otherwise the endings are still regular). In some old texts and in rural speech the archaic preterite forms <i>vide</i> and <i>vido</i> can be found instead of the current <i>vi</i> and <i>vio</i> forms.
