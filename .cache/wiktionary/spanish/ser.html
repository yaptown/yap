The form <i>sois</i> (second person plural present indicative) displaced expected <i>*estes</i> from Latin <i>estis</i>, second person plural of <i>esse</i>, while <i>ye</i> (third person singular present indicative) lost its ancestor's final <i>st</i> in <i>est</i> since it would have been too similar to <i>yes</i> (second person singular present indicative). The present subjunctive was extended with the Latin third conjugation endings, with the I in the ancestor verb's present subjunctive (originally part of that tense's endings) becoming part of the root.

<p>Like Portuguese and Spanish, Galician has two different verbs that are usually translated to English as “to be”. The verb <i class="Latn mention" lang="gl">ser</i> relates to <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/essence#English" title="essence">essence</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/origin#English" title="origin">origin</a></i>, or physical <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/description#English" title="description">description</a></i>. In contrast, the verb <i class="Latn mention" lang="gl"><a href="/wiki/estar#Galician" title="estar">estar</a></i> relates to current <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/state#English" title="state">state</a></i> or <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/position#English" title="position">position</a></i>.

<p>Spanish has two different verbs that are usually translated to English as "to be": <i class="Latn mention" lang="es"><strong class="selflink">ser</strong></i>, which relates to <b><a href="/wiki/essence" title="essence">essence</a></b>, and <i class="Latn mention" lang="es"><a href="/wiki/estar#Spanish" title="estar">estar</a></i>, which relates to <b><a href="/wiki/state" title="state">state</a></b>; these verbs are generally not interchangeable. Contrast the following:
</p>
<ul><li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">El hombre <b>está</b> feliz.</i> ― <span class="e-translation">The man <b>is</b> happy [i.e., in a good mood].</span></span></li>
<li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">El hombre <b>es</b> feliz.</i> ― <span class="e-translation">The man <b>is</b> happy [i.e., a joyous person].</span></span></li>
<li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">¿<b>Estás</b> loco&#63;</i> ― <span class="e-translation"><b>Are</b> you crazy [i.e., out of your mind]?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">¿<b>Eres</b> loco&#63;</i> ― <span class="e-translation"><b>Are</b> you crazy [i.e., an insane person]?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">El hombre <b>está</b> en España.</i> ― <span class="e-translation">The man <b>is</b> [currently located] in Spain.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">El hombre <b>es</b> de España.</i> ― <span class="e-translation">The man <b>is</b> [originally] from Spain.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">¿<a href="/wiki/c%C3%B3mo_est%C3%A1s#Spanish" title="cómo estás">Cómo <b>estás</b></a>&#63;</i> ― <span class="e-translation"><a href="/wiki/how_are_you" title="how are you">How <b>are</b> you</a>?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">¿Cómo <b>eres&#63;</b></i> ― <span class="e-translation">What <b>are</b> you like?</span></span></li></ul>
<p>The "essence/state" distinction between the two verbs is often misinterpreted as a "permanent/temporary" distinction. In most contexts these distinctions are practically synonymous (including all of the above examples) but there exist cases in which they are not, and using the latter distinction can lead one to choosing the incorrect verb. For example:
</p>
<ul><li><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="es">Mi abuelito <b>está</b> muerto.</i> ― <span class="e-translation">My grandad <b>is</b> dead.</span> <span class="e-footer">(Here <i>está</i> is used instead of <i>es</i> because death is a state, even though it is permanent.)</span></span></li>

<p>In the preterite indicative and the imperfect and future subjunctive, the conjugation of <i>ser</i> is identical to that of <i class="Latn mention" lang="es"><a href="/wiki/ir#Spanish" title="ir">ir</a></i> ("to go"). Thus, for example, <i>yo fui</i> can mean either "I was" or "I went", depending on context.
