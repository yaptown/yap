<p>The reflexive pronoun <i>si</i> is only used to refer to the third person (In English: <a href="/wiki/he" title="he">he</a>/<a href="/wiki/she" title="she">she</a>/<a href="/wiki/it" title="it">it</a>/<a href="/wiki/they" title="they">they</a>) not the first or second person (In English: <a href="/wiki/I" title="I">I</a>/<a href="/wiki/we" title="we">we</a>/<a href="/wiki/you" title="you">you</a>). When the subject of a sentence is first or second person, the same pronoun is repeated (with the accusative ending <i class="Latn mention nowrap" lang="eo"><a href="/wiki/-n#Esperanto" title="-n">-n</a></i> added if needed) instead of using <i>si</i>. (E.g. "they wash <b>themselves</b>" is <i>ili lavas <b>sin</b></i>, but "I wash <b>myself</b>" is <i>mi lavas <b>min</b></i>, instead of *<i>mi lavas sin</i>.)

<ul><li>When <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><strong class="selflink">si</strong></i> is part of an infinitive, it can be placed before it as a separate word, but more often it is attached to the end. In this case, the final -<i>e</i> of the infinitive is dropped, or, in the case of infinitives ending in -<i>rre</i>, the final -<i>re</i> is dropped. Examples: <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><a href="/wiki/amare#Italian" title="amare">amar(e)</a></i> + <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><strong class="selflink">si</strong></i> = <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><a href="/wiki/amarsi#Italian" title="amarsi">amarsi</a></i>; <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><a href="/wiki/ridurre#Italian" title="ridurre">ridur(re)</a></i> + <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><strong class="selflink">si</strong></i> = <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><a href="/wiki/ridursi#Italian" title="ridursi">ridursi</a></i>.</li>
<li>Often translated using the passive voice in English when used as indefinite personal pronoun:
<dl><dd><span class="h-usage-example"><i class="Latn mention e-example" lang="it">Si dice che <span class="q-hellip-sp"> </span><span class="q-hellip-b">&#91;</span>…<span class="q-hellip-b">&#93;</span><span class="q-hellip-b"></span></i> ― <span class="e-translation">It is said that <span class="q-hellip-sp">&#32;</span><span class="q-hellip-b">[</span>…<span class="q-hellip-b">]</span><span class="q-hellip-b">&#32;</span></span></span></dd></dl></li>
<li><i>Verb</i> + <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><strong class="selflink">si</strong></i> is often translated as <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/become#English" title="become">become</a></i> or <i class="Latn mention" lang="en"><a href="/wiki/get#English" title="get">get</a></i> + [past participle] in English.</li>
<li>In cases where <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><strong class="selflink">si</strong></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="ann-pos">indefinite pronoun</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span> and <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><strong class="selflink">si</strong></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="ann-pos">reflexive pronoun</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span> follow each other, the first <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><strong class="selflink">si</strong></i> is replaced with <i class="Latn mention" lang="it"><a href="/wiki/ci#Italian" title="ci">ci</a></i>:
