<ul><li>Both <i class="Latn mention" lang="fi"><a href="/wiki/tuo#Finnish" title="tuo">tuo</a></i> and <i class="Latn mention" lang="fi">se</i> can be translated as "that"; see <i class="Latn mention" lang="fi"><a href="/wiki/tuo#Finnish" title="tuo">tuo</a></i> for more information on the difference between the two.</li>
<li>In colloquial and dialectal Finnish, <i class="Latn mention" lang="fi">se</i> is the usual and neutral personal pronoun in the third person singular, and its standard Finnish counterpart <i class="Latn mention" lang="fi"><a href="/wiki/h%C3%A4n#Finnish" title="hän">hän</a></i> is restricted to certain particular uses. Using <i class="Latn mention" lang="fi">se</i> of a person carries no negative connotation.</li>
<li>Due to the influence of Germanic languages, and nowadays especially to that of English, <i class="Latn mention" lang="fi">se</i> may often be used as a kind of definite article in colloquial Finnish, though in standard Finnish, where word order expresses whether something is definite or indefinite, this colloquial usage is ungrammatical. (Compare the usage of <i class="Latn mention" lang="fi"><a href="/wiki/yksi#Finnish" title="yksi">yksi</a></i>.)

<p><sup>1</sup> The disjunctive (tonic) forms are also used after an explicit preposition (<i>de/d’</i>, <i>à</i>, <i>pour</i>, <i>chez</i>, <i>dans</i>, <i>vers</i>, <i>sur</i>, <i>sous</i>, ...), instead the accusative, dative, genitive, locative, or reflexive forms, where a preposition is implied.<br />
<sup>2</sup> <i>Il</i> is also used as an impersonal nominative-only pronoun.<br />
<sup>3</sup> <i>On</i> can also function as a first person plural (although agreeing with third person singular verb forms).<br />
<sup>4</sup> The nominal indeterminate form <i>ce</i> (demonstrative) can also be used with the auxiliary verb <i>être</i> as a plural, instead of the proximal or distal gendered forms.<br />
<sup>5</sup> The reflexive third person singular forms (<i>se</i> or <i>s’</i>) for accusative or dative are also used as third person plural reflexive.<br />
<sup>6</sup> <i>Vous</i> is also used as the polite singular form, in which case the plural disjunctive tonic <i>vous-mêmes</i> becomes singular <i>vous-même</i>.<br />
<sup>7</sup> <i>Ils</i>, <i>eux</i> and <i>eux-mêmes</i> are also used when a group has a mixture of masculine and feminine members.<br />

<td colspan="9" style="border: none; text-align:left;">Third person pronominal forms used as formal terms of address to refer to second person subjects (with the first letter frequently capitalised as a sign of respect, and to distinguish them from third person subjects). Unlike the singular forms, the plural forms are mostly antiquated terms of formal address in the modern language, and second person plural pronouns are almost always used instead.

<ul><li>The word "the" was used somewhat more sparingly in Old English than in the modern language. One reason is, English had only recently developed a word for "the" (<i>sē</i> previously only meant "that"), leaving many nouns and phrases which had a definite <i>meaning</i> but which people continued to use without a definite article out of custom. Examples of words which usually went without the word "the" include:

<li>Genitive phrases <i>could</i> include the word "the" before the head noun, but most often did not. Instead, genitive phrases were commonly formed like possessive phrases in modern English, with the genitive noun preceding the head noun ("John's car," not "the car of John"). Thus “the fall of Rome” was <i>Rōme hryre</i>, literally “Rome's fall,” and “the god of fire” was <i>fȳres god</i>, literally “fire's god.”</li></ul></li></ul>

comes from a number of different academic papers focused on the unique varieties and languages spoken in the Yoruboid dialectal continuum which extends from eastern Togo to southern Nigeria. The terms for spoken varieties, now deemed dialects of Yorùbá in Nigeria (i.e. Southeast Yorùbá, Northwest Yorùbá, Central Yorùbá, and Northeast Yorùbá), have converged with those of Standard Yorùbá leading to the creation of what can be labeled Common Yorùbá (Funṣọ Akere, 1977). It can be assumed that the Standard Yorùbá term can also be used in most Nigerian varieties alongside native terms, especially amongst younger speakers. This does not apply to the other Nigerian Yoruboid languages of Ìṣẹkírì and Olùkùmi, nor the Èdè Languages of Benin and Togo.</td></tr></tbody></table><style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r85481447">.mw-parser-output .dial-syn{text-align:center;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .dial-syn td .qualifier-brac,.mw-parser-output .dial-syn td .qualifier-content,.mw-parser-output .dial-syn td .annotation-paren,.mw-parser-output .dial-syn td .annotation-paren+.tr{font-size:75%}.mw-parser-output .dial-syn tr{vertical-align:top}.mw-parser-output .dial-syn th span{position:sticky;top:0}.mw-parser-output .dial-syn th{min-width:10em}</style>
