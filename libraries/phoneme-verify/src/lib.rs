//! Verify human-recorded audio against ground-truth IPA using a wav2vec2
//! phoneme model hosted on Modal.
//!
//! For each clip we:
//! 1. Hash the raw .wav bytes (xxh3_64) and check the shared cache store at
//!    `wav2vec2/<WAV2VEC2_CACHE_VERSION>/<hash>` — same caching philosophy
//!    as `translate.rs` and the tysm chat clients (hash → response). The
//!    model/decoder version is part of the key so a model swap can't
//!    silently reuse stale predictions.
//! 2. On cache miss, decode WAV → f32 mono 16kHz via ffmpeg and POST to the
//!    same Modal endpoint the AI backend uses
//!    (`yap-ai-backend/src/main.rs::get_phonemes_from_modal`), then persist
//!    the response.
//! 3. Strip suprasegmental markers from the model's predicted tokens and
//!    diff against the ground-truth IPA assembled from
//!    `word_to_pronunciation`. Ground truth has no suprasegmentals yet, so
//!    we normalize defensively on both sides.
//! 4. Report a [`ClipVerification`] with the verdict; caller decides whether
//!    to drop the clip and/or log it to the per-language failures jsonl.
//!
//! The Modal endpoint is configured via `WAV2VEC2_ENDPOINT_URL` (same env var
//! as the AI backend) with a default to the prod URL.
