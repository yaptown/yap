//! Sentence segmentation by a language model, for scripts whose subtitles
//! carry no sentence-final punctuation.
//!
//! Japanese, Mandarin, Korean and Thai subtitles mark questions and
//! exclamations but leave plain statements bare, so the rule-based passage
//! builder ([`crate::segment`]) cannot tell where a statement ends: it glues
//! unpunctuated cues together until a mark turns up, and the course keeps only
//! the questions. Here every cue is instead put to a model, one request per
//! cue, with a few neighbouring cues for context. The model answers only
//! about the focus cue — its text cut into sentences, and whether the last one
//! runs on into the next cue — so each boundary has exactly one owner and no
//! two answers can disagree about it.
//!
//! The model never writes text. Each answer is checked letter for letter
//! against the cue it came from and thrown away if it differs, so the worst
//! a bad answer can do is leave a cue segmented the old way.
//!
//! Requests go through the Batch API and tysm's response cache, keyed by the
//! prompt: a cue's answer is reused across re-timed copies of the same
//! subtitle (pauses are only described when they are long, and only to the
//! second) and across the two consumers of this crate.

Copy the text exactly: same characters, same order, nothing added, corrected or dropped, not even punctuation at a cut. The app matches entries back letter for letter and discards any answer that differs. A dash marking a change of speaker may be dropped.

A sentence is a complete utterance: a statement, question, exclamation, one-word reply or interjection. A fragment that belongs with the previous or next cue is its own entry: first if it finishes the previous cue, last and unfinished if the next cue completes it.
