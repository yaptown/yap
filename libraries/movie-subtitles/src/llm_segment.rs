//! Sentence segmentation by a language model, for scripts whose subtitles
//! carry no sentence-final punctuation.
//!
//! Japanese, Mandarin, Korean and Thai subtitles mark questions and
//! exclamations but leave plain statements bare, so the rule-based passage
//! builder ([`crate::segment`]) cannot tell where a statement ends: it glues
//! unpunctuated cues together until a mark turns up, and the course keeps only
//! the questions. Here every cue is instead put to a model, one request per
//! cue, with a few neighbouring cues for context. The model answers only
//! about the focus cue — its text cut into sentences, and whether the last one
//! runs on into the next cue — so each boundary has exactly one owner and no
//! two answers can disagree about it.
//!
//! The model never writes text. Each answer is checked letter for letter
//! against the cue it came from and thrown away if it differs, so the worst
//! a bad answer can do is leave a cue segmented the old way.
//!
//! Requests go through the Batch API and tysm's response cache, keyed by the
//! prompt: a cue's answer is reused across re-timed copies of the same
//! subtitle (pauses are only described when they are long, and only to the
//! second) and across the two consumers of this crate.

You get one focus cue with the cues before and after it as context. Return only the focus cue's text, cut into sentences in order, and whether the last one is unfinished, meaning the next cue completes it. Context text never belongs in the answer.

Copy the text exactly: same characters, same order, nothing added, corrected or dropped, not even punctuation at a cut. The app matches entries back letter for letter and discards any answer that differs. A dash marking a change of speaker may be dropped.

A sentence is a complete utterance: a statement, question, exclamation, one-word reply or interjection. A fragment that belongs with the previous or next cue is its own entry: first if it finishes the previous cue, last and unfinished if the next cue completes it.
