# Clip sidecar schema (format 2)

One JSON per served video clip, stored next to the mp4 (`<id>.json` beside
`<id>.mp4`), immutable. Cut generously (neighbor sentences as context when the
gap is ≤ ~2s, total ≤ ~15s); the sidecar — not the file boundary — defines what
the clip *is*. The app seeks to `critical.start_ms` by default and offers the
padding as opt-in context.

Principles:

- **Two time domains.** Everything the app consumes is clip-relative ms; the
  `source` block keeps film-absolute times + provenance digests so any future
  re-cut (different padding/resolution/codec) regenerates without re-running
  alignment or transcription.
- **Include everything cheap.** The whole `Clip` verdict block goes in
  verbatim, uses imagined or not — a few hundred bytes against a megabyte of
  video. Omitting is the only expensive mistake.
- **Both witnesses, independently timed.** Official subtitle cues with their
  own timings, and the full Scribe transcript with nested character spans.
  (Scribe is requested at character granularity; char spans live in the cached
  raw responses and are recovered by re-parse, not re-transcription — see
  `transcript.rs`.)
- **Context is display-only.** Neighbor cues never passed the gates:
  `context_verified: false` is categorical.
- Phoneme alignment comes from the cached frame matrices; `target_ipa`
  reproduces only under the `corpus-v1-labels` espeak build — pin it.
- Loudnorm is measured over the critical span, applied to the whole file, so a
  loud neighbor line can't duck the target sentence. Force a keyframe at or
  just before `critical.start_ms` at encode time (seeking is keyframe-accurate).
- **Id**: `imdb_id - sha256(NFC sentence text)[:8] - occurrence index`.
  The index counts occurrences of the sentence in the *official subtitle
  file*, in cue order — all occurrences, aligned or not — so it is fixed by
  `film.subtitle_digest` alone. Never index over passing clips: a gate tweak
  would renumber later occurrences and silently reuse ids for different audio.
  Gaps in the served set are fine. (Timing-based ids were rejected: repair /
  alignment changes shift `start_ms` across rebuilds.)

Caching: every artifact skips on **provenance equality, never existence**.
`clips.jsonl` re-maps when its provenance line (inputs digests, model, gate,
G2P backend identity) differs; a G2P preflight canary fails a film loudly
before anything is written. An exported clip's renditions are reused only
when the sidecar's `media.stamp` (encode recipe, source-video identity —
filename, bytes, runtime, height, HDR, audio stream — and the cut: window
and critical span) equals the one computed now — else delete and re-render.
The stamp is deliberately not the clips provenance: a re-map under a new
segmenter or gate that lands on the same span costs a sidecar rewrite, not
a day of re-encoding. The sidecar itself is always regenerated and left
untouched when it comes out byte-identical; full-language runs sweep
orphaned ids. Upload markers store the three files' content hashes and
re-upload each file whose bytes changed. Better to recalculate than to
trust a cache whose inputs may have moved.
