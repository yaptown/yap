//! Sentence → clip mapping: for every sentence a film's subtitle contains,
//! the span of audio in which it is spoken, verified twice.
//!
//! A sentence earns a clip only when two independent witnesses agree with
//! the subtitle:
//!
//! 1. **The transcript.** The sentence's tokens are aligned to the full-film
//!    word-timed transcript ([`cues::align_sentence`]); the run of words that
//!    spells it must do so near-verbatim, sit clear of neighbouring speech and
//!    of any audio event, and its word stamps give the clip its bounds. Cue
//!    times are display times, authored for reading; word stamps come from
//!    something that heard the speech, and a cue holding two sentences has no
//!    per-sentence timing at all. The cut's edges and its clear margins come
//!    from the film's earshot speech profile, not the stamps: ElevenLabs
//!    stretches a word's end stamp up to the next onset and fabricates
//!    stamps for words it inferred from context, so a boundary built on a
//!    stamp cuts off real speech or reports a gap that is not there.
//! 2. **The phoneme model.** The clip is cut and the model's per-frame
//!    distribution fetched ([`phoneme_verify::frame_matrix`]); the espeak
//!    rendering of the sentence is scored under CTC against the model's own
//!    free reading, and its first and last phonemes must be found in the
//!    audio under forced alignment ([`phoneme_verify::FrameMatrix::force_align`])
//!    — the direct test that the *whole* sentence is inside the cut. Given
//!    (1) the words are right, so what the ratio rejects beyond that is
//!    audio a listener can't actually make out — music beds, mumbling,
//!    heavy compression — which a transcription model is too robust to
//!    notice.
//!
//! Sentences are the ones course ingestion would produce from the same
//! subtitle (`movie_subtitles::segment`), keyed the same way, so a language
//! pack can look its sentences' clips up by text — independent of *which*
//! subtitle file a sentence came from.
//!
//! One `clips.jsonl` per film beside its transcript: a provenance line, then
//! one [`Clip`] per sentence that reached the phoneme gate, passing or not,
//! with every score kept so the gate can be re-tuned from the file alone.
