//! Tools for building a machine-readable, correctly-synced subtitle for every
//! movie in the library — the substrate everything else (clip cutting, audio
//! datasets) needs first.
//!
//! Sources are preferred in the order that costs least and is most trustworthy:
//! a text track already on the disc, then the disc's bitmap track read by OCR,
//! then a downloaded subtitle synchronised to the file. The first two are
//! authored against this exact file, so their timings need no correction at
//! all — which is why two thirds of the library is free.
