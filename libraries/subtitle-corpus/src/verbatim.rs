//! Is a film's subtitle what is actually said in it?
//!
//! A subtitle can be perfectly synced and still useless as a clip source: a
//! European Portuguese rewrite of a Brazilian film, a Latin American
//! translation of a Spanish one, an SDH track that condenses every line, a
//! fansub that paraphrases. Word-overlap audits pass all of these — a
//! paraphrase shares most of its words with the speech — so the measure here
//! is the one the clip mapper actually applies: the share of eligible
//! sentences (three or more tokens, no digits) that [`crate::clips::place`]
//! can find near-verbatim in the transcript at the time the subtitle claims.
//! Verbatim tracks sit at 40–90%; rewrites at 0–20%.
//!
//! A subtitle can also be verbatim but on another clock — a different cut,
//! or a download the syncers never placed. Word anchors against the full
//! transcript ([`sync::find_anchors`]) fit a shift and rate; when the
//! sentences place under that fit but not at identity, the verdict is
//! [`Verdict::Skewed`] and the fit is reported so the caller can re-time the
//! file. That repair is only right when the subtitle's clock is the suspect:
//! a disc track is authored to this file, so a disc track that reads as
//! skewed means the *audio* is off, and re-timing it would hide the defect.
//!
//! The verdict is written beside the film as `transcript-check.json`, keyed
//! by digests of both inputs, so a re-run is free until either changes.
