//! Transcribing a whole film, so a subtitle can be checked against what was
//! said rather than merely against when someone was speaking.
//!
//! The early Whisper sync samples a handful of 60s windows and fits an
//! offset. That is enough to place a
//! subtitle, and nowhere near enough to judge one. A cue can sit on the right
//! second and still carry a sound tag, a song lyric, a speaker label, or a
//! sentence condensed to half of what the actor actually said. Answering that
//! needs the whole film's words, once, kept.
//!
//! Transcription is ElevenLabs Scribe v2, chosen over Cloudflare and Groq's
//! Whisper endpoints and two Cohere models on twelve blinded reads of two
//! films (English and Japanese) by four independent judges: it placed first in
//! every one. What decided it was fidelity to the things a subtitler removes —
//! it keeps "um", false starts and stammers in English, and Hida dialect forms
//! (見とる, 〜っす, なん) in Japanese where every Whisper flattens them to
//! standard grammar. A transcript that tidies speech the way a subtitler does
//! cannot reveal that the subtitler tidied.
//!
//! Two things make it affordable. The audio is already extracted to
//! `audio.opus`, so nothing decodes a 30GB remux; and the responses are
//! cached in the shared osmo store by source digest, chunk boundaries and
//! request settings. Cache hits need no audio decoding.
//!
//! # Where the cuts go
//!
//! A transcriber hallucinates in silence, and a cut through the middle of a
//! word invents a word on each side of it. So chunk boundaries are chosen from the
//! film's speech profile rather than by the clock: around each 10-minute mark
//! we search ±90s for the quietest half-second and cut there. Measured over
//! 1,679 boundaries in 150 check-confirmed films, that lands under 0.30 —
//! confident silence — 96.3% of the time, under 0.40 in 99.9%, with a worst
//! case of 0.401 against a nominal voice threshold of 0.5.
//!
//! Note the profile must be the *film's*, computed in one pass: earshot's
//! detector is recurrent, carrying 128 floats of minGRU state plus three
//! frames of context, so scoring the cut chunks separately would start each
//! one cold at precisely the moment we care about.
