//! One-off recovery of the raw SRTs the downloader used to throw away.
//!
//! Every movie already has `subtitles/<imdb>.jsonl` — dialogue that was
//! cleaned on the way to disk, with the original SRT discarded. This binary
//! re-downloads the candidates OpenSubtitles offers for that movie and looks
//! for the one which, run back through the *same* automatic preprocessing,
//! reproduces the stored JSONL **exactly**.
//!
//! Exactness is the whole point and is deliberately not relaxed. Some JSONL
//! files were hand-edited afterwards to fix OCR typos, and those edits exist
//! nowhere else. A fuzzy match would happily accept the pre-correction SRT,
//! promote it to source-of-truth, and silently revert those fixes on the next
//! build. So: an exact match is recovered, and anything short of one is left
//! alone and reported. A near-miss is itself the useful signal — it usually
//! means *that* file is one of the hand-corrected ones.
//!
//! Downloads are metered by OpenSubtitles, so the run is resumable: progress
//! is appended to a per-language ledger, an exhausted daily quota stops the
//! run cleanly rather than burning through the remaining movies recording
//! false verdicts, and no SRT that cost a download is ever discarded — the
//! best near-miss is kept under `subtitles-unmatched/` for later inspection.
